Andrew Witty - Wikipedia  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Witty" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Witty</a><br>
<br>
Sir Andrew Philip Witty (born 22 August 1964) was the chief executive officer (CEO) of American health insurance company UnitedHealth Group from February 2021 to May 2025.[1][2] He was also the CEO of the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline from 2008 to 2017, and chancellor of the University of Nottingham from 2013 to 2017.[3] He also assisted the World Health Organization in developing a vaccine for COVID-19.<br>
Witty became CEO of UnitedHealth Group in February 2021.[29]<br>
In April 2021, he was also appointed to the Pandemic Preparedness Partnership (PPP), an expert group chaired by Vallance to advise the G7 presidency held by the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.<br>
*<br>
“UnitedHealth Group has a new chief executive, Stephen Hemsley, after Andrew Witty stepped aside "for personal reasons."”<br>

The company is now counting on the experience of Stephen Hemsley, who returned as CEO to steer it through the current crisis. <br>
"Hemsley has the experience and leadership attributes that the company needs to restore credibility and right the ship," said James Harlow, senior vice president at Novare Capital Management.  <br>

Stephen J. Hemsley - Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_J._Hemsley" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_J._Hemsley</a><br>
<br>
Stephen J. Hemsley (born 4 June 1952)[1][2] is an American businessman who is the chair of the board and chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group Inc. In August 2017, UnitedHealth announced that Hemsley would be stepping down after more than a decade as CEO and starting a newly created role of executive chairman of the board.[3] Stephen J. Hemsley returned to his prior post on May 13, 2025, after being reappointed as CEO.[4][5]<br>
A lawsuit was filed against Hemsley, then UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and two other senior executives in May 2024 for alleged fraud and insider trading due to failing to disclose an antitrust investigation into the company by the United States Department of Justiceand by selling stock options before the probe was made public.[6][7][8] Data concerning these allegations and notice of its report to the Securities and Exchange Commission was initially published in the Minnesota Star Tribune in February 2024.[9]<br>
Early life and education<br>
edit<br>
Stephen J. Hemsley was born in 1952. He graduated from Fordham University in 1974.[10]<br>
He was managing partner and chief financial officer at Arthur Andersen. <br>
[Arthur Andersen - Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen</a>  <br>
Arthur Andersen LLP was an American accounting firm based in Chicago that provided auditing, tax advising, consulting and other professional services to large corporations. By 2001, it had become one of the world's largest multinational corporations and was one of the "Big Five" accounting firms (along with Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers). <br>
The firm collapsed by mid-2002, as details of its questionable accounting practices for energy company Enron and telecommunications company WorldCom were revealed amid the two high-profile bankruptcies. The scandals were a factor in the enactment of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002.]<br>
<br>
In 1997, he joined the UnitedHealth Group. He was its chief executive officer from 2006.<br>
He was more involved in the handling of backdated stock options than previously revealed, according to documents filed in a 2008 shareholder lawsuit in a Minneapolis District Court.[11] The company's two investigations largely exonerated him from the backdating scandal. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both United Health Care itself and its former general counsel.[12]<br>

Killing of Brian Thompson - Wikipedia<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Brian_Thompson" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Brian_Thompson</a><br>
<br>
Brian Robert Thompson[4][5] (July 10, 1974 – December 4, 2024), the CEO of the American health insurance company UnitedHealthcare, was shot and killed in Midtown Manhattan,  New York City, on December 4, 2024. The shooting occurred early in the morning outside an entrance to the New York Hilton Midtown.[6] The suspect, initially described as a white man wearing a mask, fled the scene.[1] The words "delay," "deny," and "depose" were inscribed on the cartridge cases used during the shooting. Thompson had previously faced criticism for the company's rejection of insurance claims, and his family reported that he had received death threats.<br>
On December 9, 2024, authorities arrested 26-year-old Luigi Mangione in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and charged him in a Manhattan court with Thompson's killing.[7][8][9]Authorities say that when Mangione was apprehended, he was carrying a 3D-printed pistol and a 3D-printedsuppressor consistent with those used in the attack; a short handwritten letter criticizing the American healthcare system; an American passport; and multiple fraudulent IDs, including one with the same name used to check into a hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.[10][11][12] Authorities also said his fingerprints matched the partial smudged prints that investigators found near the New York shooting scene.[13] Police believe that he was inspired by "Unabomber" Ted Kaczynski's manifesto Industrial Society and Its Future (1995) and motivated by his own personal views on US health insurance.[14][15]<br>
…<br>
 United States Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in Mangione's federal case.<br>
