<br>
A few fables<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Moral Principle and the Material Interest . . .</span><br>
A Moral Principle met a Material Interest on a bridge wide enough for but one.<br>
“Down, you base thing!” thundered the Moral Principle, “and let me pass over you!”<br>
The Material Interest merely looked in the other’s eyes without saying anything.<br>
“Ah,” said the Moral Principle, hesitatingly, “let us draw lots to see which shall retire till the other has crossed.”<br>
The Material Interest maintained an unbroken silence and an unwavering stare.<br>
“In order to avoid a conflict,” the Moral Principle resumed, somewhat uneasily, “I shall myself lie down and let you walk over me.”<br>
Then the Material Interest found a tongue, and by a strange coincidence it was its own tongue.  “I don’t think you are very good walking,” it said.  “I am a little particular about what I have underfoot.  Suppose you get off into the water.”<br>
It occurred that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Crimson Candle</span><br>
A man lying at the point of death called his wife to his bedside and said:<br>
“I am about to leave you forever; give me, therefore, one last proof of your affection and fidelity, for, according to our holy religion, a married man seeking admittance at the gate of Heaven is required to swear that he has never defiled himself with an unworthy woman.  In my desk you will find a crimson candle, which has been blessed by the High Priest and has a peculiar mystical significance.  Swear to me that while it is in existence you will not remarry.”<br>
The Woman swore and the Man died.  At the funeral the Woman stood at the head of the bier, holding a lighted crimson candle till it was wasted entirely away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Ingenious Patriot</span><br>
Having obtained an audience of the King an Ingenious Patriot pulled a paper from his pocket, saying:<br>
“May it please your Majesty, I have here a formula for constructing armour-plating which no gun can pierce.  If these plates are adopted in the Royal Navy our warships will be invulnerable, and therefore invincible.  Here, also, are reports of your Majesty’s Ministers, attesting the value of the invention.  I will part with my right in it for a million tumtums.”<br>
After examining the papers, the King put them away and promised him an order on the Lord High Treasurer of the Extortion Department for a million tumtums.<br>
“And here,” said the Ingenious Patriot, pulling another paper from another pocket, “are the working plans of a gun that I have invented, which will pierce that armour.  Your Majesty’s Royal Brother, the Emperor of Bang, is anxious to purchase it, but loyalty to your Majesty’s throne and person constrains me to offer it first to your Majesty.  The price is one million tumtums.”<br>
Having received the promise of another check, he thrust his hand into still another pocket, remarking:<br>
“The price of the irresistible gun would have been much greater, your Majesty, but for the fact that its missiles can be so effectively averted by my peculiar method of treating the armour plates with a new—”<br>
The King signed to the Great Head Factotum to approach.<br>
“Search this man,” he said, “and report how many pockets he has.”<br>
“Forty-three, Sire,” said the Great Head Factotum, completing the scrutiny.<br>
“May it please your Majesty,” cried the Ingenious Patriot, in terror, “one of them contains tobacco.”<br>
“Hold him up by the ankles and shake him,” said the King; “then give him a check for forty-two million tumtums and put him to death.  Let a decree issue declaring ingenuity a capital offence.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Politicians</span><br>
An Old Politician and a Young Politician were travelling through a beautiful country, by the dusty highway which leads to the City of Prosperous Obscurity.  Lured by the flowers and the shade and charmed by the songs of birds which invited to woodland paths and green fields, his imagination fired by glimpses of golden domes and glittering palaces in the distance on either hand, the Young Politician said:<br>
“Let us, I beseech thee, turn aside from this comfortless road leading, thou knowest whither, but not I.  Let us turn our backs upon duty and abandon ourselves to the delights and advantages which beckon from every grove and call to us from every shining hill.  Let us, if so thou wilt, follow this beautiful path, which, as thou seest, hath a guide-board saying, ‘Turn in here all ye who seek the Palace of Political Distinction.’”<br>
“It is a beautiful path, my son,” said the Old Politician, without either slackening his pace or turning his head, “and it leadeth among pleasant scenes.  But the search for the Palace of Political Distinction is beset with one mighty peril.”<br>
“What is that?” said the Young Politician.<br>
“The peril of finding it,” the Old Politician replied, pushing on.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">An Unspeakable Imbecile</span><br>
A Judge said to a Convicted Assassin:<br>
“Prisoner at the bar, have you anything to say why the death-sentence should not be passed upon you?”<br>
“Will what I say make any difference?” asked the Convicted Assassin.<br>
“I do not see how it can,” the Judge answered, reflectively.  “No, it will not.”<br>
“Then,” said the doomed one, “I should just like to remark that you are the most unspeakable old imbecile in seven States and the District of Columbia.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Dog and the Physician</span><br>
A Dog that had seen a Physician attending the burial of a wealthy patient, said: “When do you expect to dig it up?”<br>
“Why should I dig it up?” the Physician asked.<br>
“When I bury a bone,” said the Dog, “it is with an intention to uncover it later and pick it.”<br>
“The bones that I bury,” said the Physician, “are those that I can no longer pick.”</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The City of Political Distinction</span><br>
Jamrach the Rich, being anxious to reach the City of Political Distinction before nightfall, arrived at a fork of the road and was undecided which branch to follow; so he consulted a Wise-Looking Person who sat by the wayside.<br>
“Take that road,” said the Wise-Looking Person, pointing it out; “it is known as the Political Highway.”<br>
“Thank you,” said Jamrach, and was about to proceed.<br>
“About how much do you thank me?” was the reply.  “Do you suppose I am here for my health?”<br>
As Jamrach had not become rich by stupidity, he handed something to his guide and hastened on, and soon came to a toll-gate kept by a Benevolent Gentleman, to whom he gave something, and was suffered to pass.  A little farther along he came to a bridge across an imaginary stream, where a Civil Engineer (who had built the bridge) demanded something for interest on his investment, and it was forthcoming.  It was growing late when Jamrach came to the margin of what appeared to be a lake of black ink, and there the road terminated.  Seeing a Ferryman in his boat he paid something for his passage and was about to embark.<br>
“No,” said the Ferryman.  “Put your neck in this noose, and I will tow you over.  It is the only way,” he added, seeing that the passenger was about to complain of the accommodations.<br>
In due time he was dragged across, half strangled, and dreadfully beslubbered by the feculent waters.  “There,” said the Ferryman, hauling him ashore and disengaging him, “you are now in the City of Political Distinction.  It has fifty millions of inhabitants, and as the colour of the Filthy Pool does not wash off, they all look exactly alike.”<br>
“Alas!” exclaimed Jamrach, weeping and bewailing the loss of all his possessions, paid out in tips and tolls; “I will go back with you.”<br>
“I don’t think you will,”, said the Ferryman, pushing off; “this city is situated on the Island of the Unreturning.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Alderman and the Raccoon</span><br>
“I see quite a number of rings on your tail,” said an Alderman to a Raccoon that he met in a zoölogical garden.<br>
“Yes,” replied the Raccoon, “and I hear quite a number of tales on your ring.”<br>
The Alderman, being of a sensitive, retiring disposition, shrank from further comparison, and, strolling to another part of the garden, stole the camel.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Holy Deacon</span><br>
An Itinerant Preacher who had wrought hard in the moral vineyard for several hours whispered to a Holy Deacon of the local church:<br>
“Brother, these people know you, and your active support will bear fruit abundantly.  Please pass the plate for me, and you shall have one fourth.”<br>
The Holy Deacon did so, and putting the money into his pocket waited till the congregation was dismissed and said goodnight.<br>
“But the money, brother, the money that you collected!” said the Itinerant Preacher.<br>
“Nothing is coming to you,” was the reply; “the Adversary has hardened their hearts, and one fourth is all they gave.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Foolish Woman</span><br>
A Married Woman, whose lover was about to reform by running away, procured a pistol and shot him dead.<br>
“Why did you do that, Madam?” inquired a Policeman, sauntering by.<br>
“Because,” replied the Married Woman, “he was a wicked man, and had purchased a ticket to Chicago.”<br>
“My sister,” said an adjacent Man of God, solemnly, “you cannot stop the wicked from going to Chicago by killing them.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Father and Son</span><br>
“My boy,” said an aged Father to his fiery and disobedient Son, “a hot temper is the soil of remorse.  Promise me that when next you are angry you will count one hundred before you move or speak.”<br>
No sooner had the Son promised than he received a stinging blow from the paternal walking-stick, and by the time he had counted to seventy-five had the unhappiness to see the old man jump into a waiting cab and whirl away.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Deceased and his Heirs</span><br>
A Man died leaving a large estate and many sorrowful relations who claimed it.  After some years, when all but one had had judgment given against them, that one was awarded the estate, which he asked his Attorney to have appraised.<br>
“There is nothing to appraise,” said the Attorney, pocketing his last fee.<br>
“Then,” said the Successful Claimant, “what good has all this litigation done me?”<br>
“You have been a good client to me,” the Attorney replied, gathering up his books and papers, “but I must say you betray a surprising ignorance of the purpose of litigation.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Party Manager and the Gentleman</span><br>
A Party Manager said to a Gentleman whom he saw minding his own business:<br>
“How much will you pay for a nomination to office?”<br>
“Nothing,” the Gentleman replied.<br>
“But you will contribute something to the campaign fund to assist in your election, will you not?” asked the Party Manager, winking.<br>
“Oh, no,” said the Gentleman, gravely.  “If the people wish me to work for them, they must hire me without solicitation.  I am very comfortable without office.”<br>
“But,” urged the Party Manager, “an election is a thing to be desired.  It is a high honour to be a servant of the people.”<br>
“If servitude is a high honour,” the Gentleman said, “it would be indecent for me to seek it; and if obtained by my own exertion it would be no honour.”<br>
“Well,” persisted the Party Manager, “you will at least, I hope, indorse the party platform.”<br>
The Gentleman replied: “It is improbable that its authors have accurately expressed my views without consulting me; and if I indorsed their work without approving it I should be a liar.”<br>
“You are a detestable hypocrite and an idiot!” shouted the Party Manager.<br>
“Even your good opinion of my fitness,” replied the Gentleman, “shall not persuade me.”</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Discontented Malefactor</span><br>
A Judge having sentenced a Malefactor to the penitentiary was proceeding to point out to him the disadvantages of crime and the profit of reformation.<br>
“Your Honour,” said the Malefactor, interrupting, “would you be kind enough to alter my punishment to ten years in the penitentiary and nothing else?”<br>
“Why,” said the Judge, surprised, “I have given you only three years!”<br>
“Yes, I know,” assented the Malefactor—“three years’ imprisonment and the preaching.  If you please, I should like to commute the preaching.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Man and the Lightning</span><br>
A Man Running for Office was overtaken by Lightning.<br>
“You see,” said the Lightning, as it crept past him inch by inch, “I can travel considerably faster than you.”<br>
“Yes,” the Man Running for Office replied, “but think how much longer I keep going!”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Ineffective Rooter</span><br>
A Drunken Man was lying in the road with a bleeding nose, upon which he had fallen, when a Pig passed that way.<br>
“You wallow fairly well,” said the Pig, “but, my fine fellow, you have much to learn about rooting.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">A Hasty Settlement</span><br>
“Your Honour,” said an Attorney, rising, “what is the present status of this case—as far as it has gone?”<br>
“I have given a judgment for the residuary legatee under the will,” said the Court, “put the costs upon the contestants, decided all questions relating to fees and other charges; and, in short, the estate in litigation has been settled, with all controversies, disputes, misunderstandings, and differences of opinion thereunto appertaining.”<br>
“Ah, yes, I see,” said the Attorney, thoughtfully, “we are making progress—we are getting on famously.”<br>
“Progress?” echoed the Judge—“progress?  Why, sir, the matter is concluded!”<br>
“Exactly, exactly; it had to be concluded in order to give relevancy to the motion that I am about to make.  Your Honour, I move that the judgment of the Court be set aside and the case reopened.”<br>
“Upon what ground, sir?” the Judge asked in surprise.<br>
“Upon the ground,” said the Attorney, “that after paying all fees and expenses of litigation and all charges against the estate there will still be something left.”<br>
“There may have been an error,” said His Honour, thoughtfully—“the Court may have underestimated the value of the estate.  The motion is taken under advisement.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Fortune and the Fabulist</span><br>
A Writer of Fables was passing through a lonely forest when he met a Fortune.  Greatly alarmed, he tried to climb a tree, but the Fortune pulled him down and bestowed itself upon him with cruel persistence.<br>
“Why did you try to run away?” said the Fortune, when his struggles had ceased and his screams were stilled.  “Why do you glare at me so inhospitably?”<br>
“I don’t know what you are,” replied the Writer of Fables, deeply disturbed.<br>
“I am wealth; I am respectability,” the Fortune explained; “I am elegant houses, a yacht, and a clean shirt every day.  I am leisure, I am travel, wine, a shiny hat, and an unshiny coat.  I am enough to eat.”<br>
“All right,” said the Writer of Fables, in a whisper; “but for goodness’ sake speak lower.”<br>
“Why so?” the Fortune asked, in surprise.<br>
“So as not to wake me,” replied the Writer of Fables, a holy calm brooding upon his beautiful face.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">A Smiling Idol</span><br>
An Idol said to a Missionary, “My friend, why do you seek to bring me into contempt?  If it had not been for me, what would you have been?  Remember thy creator that thy days be long in the land.”<br>
“I confess,” replied the Missionary, fingering a number of ten-cent pieces which a Sunday-school in his own country had forwarded to him, “that I am a product of you, but I protest that you cannot quote Scripture with accuracy and point.  Therefore will I continue to go up against you with the Sword of the Spirit.”<br>
Shortly afterwards the Idol’s worshippers held a great religious ceremony at the base of his pedestal, and as a part of the rites the Missionary was roasted whole.  As the tongue was removed for the high priest’s table, “Ah,” said the Idol to himself, “that is the Sword of the Spirit—the only Sword that is less dangerous when unsheathed.”<br>
And he smiled so pleasantly at his own wit that the provinces of Ghargaroo, M’gwana, and Scowow were affected with a blight.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Sportsman and the Squirrel</span><br>
A Sportsman who had wounded a Squirrel, which was making desperate efforts to drag itself away, ran after it with a stick, exclaiming:<br>
“Poor thing!  I will put it out of its misery.”<br>
At that moment the Squirrels stopped from exhaustion, and looking up at its enemy, said:<br>
“I don’t venture to doubt the sincerity of your compassion, though it comes rather late, but you seem to lack the faculty of observation.  Do you not perceive by my actions that the dearest wish of my heart is to continue in my misery?”<br>
At this exposure of his hypocrisy, the Sportsman was so overcome with shame and remorse that he would not strike the Squirrel, but pointing it out to his dog, walked thoughtfully away.</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Basking Cyclone</span><br>
A Negro in a boat, gathering driftwood, saw a sleeping Alligator, and, thinking it was a log, fell to estimating the number of shingles it would make for his new cabin.  Having satisfied his mind on that point, he stuck his boat-hook into the beast’s back to harvest his good fortune.  Thereupon the saurian emerged from his dream and took to the water, greatly to the surprise of the man-and-brother.<br>
“I never befo’ seen such a cyclone as dat,” he exclaimed as soon as he had recovered his breath.  “It done carry away de ruf of my house!”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Unchanged Diplomatist</span><br>
The republic of Madagonia had been long and well represented at the court of the King of Patagascar by an officer called a Dazie, but one day the Madagonian Parliament conferred upon him the superior rank of Dandee.  The next day after being apprised of his new dignity he hastened to inform the King of Patagascar.<br>
“Ah, yes, I understand,” said the King; “you have been promoted and given increased pay and allowances.  There was an appropriation?”<br>
“Yes, your Majesty.”<br>
“And you have now two heads, have you not?”<br>
“Oh, no, your Majesty—only one, I assure you.”<br>
“Indeed?  And how many legs and arms?”<br>
“Two of each, Sire—only two of each.”<br>
“And only one body?”<br>
“Just a single body, as you perceive.”<br>
Thoughtfully removing his crown and scratching the royal head, the monarch was silent a moment, and then he said:<br>
“I fancy that appropriation has been misapplied.  You seem to be about the same kind of idiot that you were before.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Compassionate Physician</span><br>
A Kind-Hearted Physician sitting at the bedside of a patient afflicted with an incurable and painful disease, heard a noise behind him, and turning saw a cat laughing at the feeble efforts of a wounded mouse to drag itself out of the room.<br>
“You cruel beast!” cried he.  “Why don’t you kill it at once, like a lady?”<br>
Rising, he kicked the cat out of the door, and picking up the mouse compassionately put it out of its misery by pulling off its head.  Recalled to the bedside by the moans of his patient, the Kind-hearted Physician administered a stimulant, a tonic, and a nutrient, and went away.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Ashes of Madame Blavatsky</span><br>
The two brightest lights of Theosophy being in the same place at once in company with the Ashes of Madame Blavatsky, an Inquiring Soul thought the time propitious to learn something worth while.  So he sat at the feet of one awhile, and then he sat awhile at the feet of the other, and at last he applied his ear to the keyhole of the casket containing the Ashes of Madame Blavatsky.  When the Inquiring Soul had completed his course of instruction he declared himself the Ahkoond of Swat, fell into the baleful habit of standing on his head, and swore that the mother who bore him was a pragmatic paralogism.  Wherefore he was held in high reverence, and when the two other gentlemen were hanged for lying the Theosophists elected him to the leadership of their Disastral Body, and after a quiet life and an honourable death by the kick of a jackass he was reincarnated as a Yellow Dog.  As such he ate the Ashes of Madame Blavatsky, and Theosophy was no more.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Eligible Son-in-Law</span><br>
A Truly Pious Person who conducted a savings bank and lent money to his sisters and his cousins and his aunts of both sexes, was approached by a Tatterdemalion, who applied for a loan of one hundred thousand dollars.<br>
“What security have you to offer?” asked the Truly Pious Person.<br>
“The best in the world,” the applicant replied, confidentially; “I am about to become your son-in-law.”<br>
“That would indeed be gilt-edged,” said the banker, gravely; “but what claim have you to the hand of my daughter?”<br>
“One that cannot be lightly denied,” said the Tatterdemalion.  “I am about to become worth one hundred thousand dollars.”<br>
Unable to detect a weak point in this scheme of mutual advantage, the financier gave the promoter in disguise an order for the money, and wrote a note to his wife directing her to count out the girl.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Opossum of the Future</span><br>
One day an Opossum who had gone to sleep hanging from the highest branch of a tree by the tail, awoke and saw a large Snake wound about the limb, between him and the trunk of the tree.<br>
“If I hold on,” he said to himself, “I shall be swallowed; if I let go I shall break my neck.”<br>
But suddenly he bethought himself to dissemble.<br>
“My perfected friend,” he said, “my parental instinct recognises in you a noble evidence and illustration of the theory of development.  You are the Opossum of the Future, the ultimate Fittest Survivor of our species, the ripe result of progressive prehensility—all tail!”<br>
But the Snake, proud of his ancient eminence in Scriptural history, was strictly orthodox, and did not accept the scientific view.</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Tried Assassin</span><br>
An Assassin being put upon trial in a New England court, his Counsel rose and said: “Your Honour, I move for a discharge on the ground of ‘once in jeopardy’: my client has been already tried for that murder and acquitted.”<br>
“In what court?” asked the Judge.<br>
“In the Superior Court of San Francisco,” the Counsel replied.<br>
“Let the trial proceed—your motion is denied,” said the Judge.  “An Assassin is not in jeopardy when tried in California.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">A Causeway</span><br>
A Rich Woman having returned from abroad disembarked at the foot of Knee-deep Street, and was about to walk to her hotel through the mud.<br>
“Madam,” said a Policeman, “I cannot permit you to do that; you would soil your shoes and stockings.”<br>
“Oh, that is of no importance, really,” replied the Rich Woman, with a cheerful smile.<br>
“But, madam, it is needless; from the wharf to the hotel, as you observe, extends an unbroken line of prostrate newspaper men who crave the honour of having you walk upon them.”<br>
“In that case,” she said, seating herself in a doorway and unlocking her satchel, “I shall have to put on my rubber boots.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Two in Trouble</span><br>
Meeting a fat and patriotic Statesman on his way to Washington to beseech the President for an office, an idle Tramp accosted him and begged twenty-five cents with which to buy a suit of clothes.<br>
“Melancholy wreck,” said the Statesman, “what brought you to this state of degradation?  Liquor, I suppose.”<br>
“I am temperate to the verge of absurdity,” replied the Tramp.  “My foible was patriotism; I was ruined by the baneful habit of trying to serve my country.  What ruined you?”<br>
“Indolence.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Good Government</span><br>
“What a happy land you are!” said a Republican Form of Government to a Sovereign State.  “Be good enough to lie still while I walk upon you, singing the praises of universal suffrage and descanting upon the blessings of civil and religious liberty.  In the meantime you can relieve your feelings by cursing the one-man power and the effete monarchies of Europe.”<br>
“My public servants have been fools and rogues from the date of your accession to power,” replied the State; “my legislative bodies, both State and municipal, are bands of thieves; my taxes are insupportable; my courts are corrupt; my cities are a disgrace to civilisation; my corporations have their hands at the throats of every private interest—all my affairs are in disorder and criminal confusion.”<br>
“That is all very true,” said the Republican Form of Government, putting on its hobnail shoes; “but consider how I thrill you every Fourth of July.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Physicians Two</span><br>
A Wicked Old Man finding himself ill sent for a Physician, who prescribed for him and went away.  Then the Wicked Old Man sent for another Physician, saying nothing of the first, and an entirely different treatment was ordered.  This continued for some weeks, the physicians visiting him on alternate days and treating him for two different disorders, with constantly enlarging doses of medicine and more and more rigorous nursing.  But one day they accidently met at his bedside while he slept, and the truth coming out a violent quarrel ensued.<br>
“My good friends,” said the patient, awakened by the noise of the dispute, and apprehending the cause of it, “pray be more reasonable.  If I could for weeks endure you both, can you not for a little while endure each other?  I have been well for ten days, but have remained in bed in the hope of gaining by repose the strength that would justify me in taking your medicines.  So far I have touched none of it.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Overlooked Factor</span><br>
A Man that owned a fine Dog, and by a careful selection of its mate had bred a number of animals but a little lower than the angels, fell in love with his washerwoman, married her, and reared a family of dolts.<br>
“Alas!” he exclaimed, contemplating the melancholy result, “had I but chosen a mate for myself with half the care that I did for my Dog I should now be a proud and happy father.”<br>
“I’m not so sure of that,” said the Dog, overhearing the lament.  “There’s a difference, certainly, between your whelps and mine, but I venture to flatter myself that it is not due altogether to the mothers.  You and I are not entirely alike ourselves.”</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Kangaroo and the Zebra</span><br>
A Kangaroo hopping awkwardly along with some bulky object concealed in her pouch met a Zebra, and desirous of keeping his attention upon himself, said:<br>
“Your costume looks as if you might have come out of the penitentiary.”<br>
“Appearances are deceitful,” replied the Zebra, smiling in the consciousness of a more insupportable wit, “or I should have to think that you had come out of the Legislature.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Austere Governor</span><br>
A Governor visiting a State prison was implored by a Convict to pardon him.<br>
“What are you in for?” asked the Governor.<br>
“I held a high office,” the Convict humbly replied, “and sold subordinate appointments.”<br>
“Then I decline to interfere,” said the Governor, with asperity; “a man who abuses his office by making it serve a private end and purvey a personal advantage is unfit to be free.  By the way, Mr. Warden,” he added to that official, as the Convict slunk away, “in appointing you to this position, I was given to understand that your friends could make the Shikane county delegation to the next State convention solid for—for the present Administration.  Was I rightly informed?”<br>
“You were, sir.”<br>
“Very well, then, I will bid you good-day.  Please be so good as to appoint my nephew Night Chaplain and Reminder of Mothers and Sisters.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Religions of Error</span><br>
Hearing a sound of strife, a Christian in the Orient asked his Dragoman the cause of it.<br>
“The Buddhists are cutting Mohammedan throats,” the Dragoman replied, with oriental composure.<br>
“I did not know,” remarked the Christian, with scientific interest, “that that would make so much noise.”<br>
“The Mohammedans are cutting Buddhist throats, too,” added the Dragoman.<br>
“It is astonishing,” mused the Christian, “how violent and how general are religious animosities.  Everywhere in the world the devotees of each local faith abhor the devotees of every other, and abstain from murder only so long as they dare not commit it.  And the strangest thing about it is that all religions are erroneous and mischievous excepting mine.  Mine, thank God, is true and benign.”<br>
So saying he visibly smugged and went off to telegraph for a brigade of cutthroats to protect Christian interests.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Devoted Widow</span><br>
A Widow weeping on her husband’s grave was approached by an Engaging Gentleman who, in a respectful manner, assured her that he had long entertained for her the most tender feelings.<br>
“Wretch!” cried the Widow.  “Leave me this instant!  Is this a time to talk to me of love?”<br>
“I assure you, madam, that I had not intended to disclose my affection,” the Engaging Gentleman humbly explained, “but the power of your beauty has overcome my discretion.”<br>
“You should see me when I have not been crying,” said the Widow.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Desperate Object</span><br>
A Dishonest Gain was driving in its luxurious carriage through its private park, when it saw something which frantically and repeatedly ran against a stone wall, endeavouring to butt out its brains.<br>
“Hold!  Hold! thou desperate Object,” cried the Dishonest Gain; “these beautiful private grounds are no place for such work as thine.”<br>
“True,” said the Object, pausing; “I have other and better grounds for it.”<br>
“Then thou art a happy man,” said the Dishonest Gain, “and thy bleeding head is but mere dissembling.  Who art thou, great actor?”<br>
“I am known,” said the Object, dashing itself again at the wall, “as the Consciousness of Duty Well Performed.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Power of the Scalawag</span><br>
A Forestry Commissioner had just felled a giant tree when, seeing an honest man approaching, he dropped his axe and fled.  The next day when he cautiously returned to get his axe, he found the following lines pencilled on the stump:<br>
“What nature reared by centuries of toil,<br>
A scalawag in half a day can spoil;<br>
An equal fate for him may Heaven provide—<br>
Damned in the moment of his tallest pride.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Seeker and the Sought</span><br>
A Politician seeing a fat Turkey which he wanted for dinner, baited a hook with a grain of corn and dragged it before the fowl at the end of a long and almost invisible line.  When the Turkey had swallowed the hook, the Politician ran, drawing the creature after him.<br>
“Fellow-citizens,” he cried, addressing some turkey-breeders whom he met, “you observe that the man does not seek the bird, but the bird seeks the man.  For this unsolicited and unexpected dinner I thank you with all my heart.”</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Philosophers Three</span><br>
A Bear, a Fox, and an Opossum were attacked by an inundation.<br>
“Death loves a coward,” said the Bear, and went forward to fight the flood.<br>
“What a fool!” said the Fox.  “I know a trick worth two of that.”  And he slipped into a hollow stump.<br>
“There are malevolent forces,” said the Opossum, “which the wise will neither confront nor avoid.  The thing is to know the nature of your antagonist.”<br>
So saying the Opossum lay down and pretended to be dead.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Patriot and the Banker</span><br>
A Patriot who had taken office poor and retired rich was introduced at a bank where he desired to open an account.<br>
“With pleasure,” said the Honest Banker; “we shall be glad to do business with you; but first you must make yourself an honest man by restoring what you stole from the Government.”<br>
“Good heavens!” cried the Patriot; “if I do that, I shall have nothing to deposit with you.”<br>
“I don’t see that,” the Honest Banker replied.  “We are not the whole American people.”<br>
“Ah, I understand,” said the Patriot, musing.  “At what sum do you estimate this bank’s proportion of the country’s loss by me?”<br>
“About a dollar,” answered the Honest Banker.<br>
And with a proud consciousness of serving his country wisely and well he charged that sum to the account.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">A Forfeited Right</span><br>
The Chief of the Weather Bureau having predicted a fine day, a Thrifty Person hastened to lay in a large stock of umbrellas, which he exposed for sale on the sidewalk; but the weather remained clear, and nobody would buy.  Thereupon the Thrifty Person brought an action against the Chief of the Weather Bureau for the cost of the umbrellas.<br>
“Your Honour,” said the defendant’s attorney, when the case was called, “I move that this astonishing action be dismissed.  Not only is my client in no way responsible for the loss, but he distinctly foreshadowed the very thing that caused it.”<br>
“That is just it, your Honour,” replied the counsel for the plaintiff; “the defendant by making a correct forecast fooled my client in the only way that he could do so.  He has lied so much and so notoriously that he has neither the legal nor moral right to tell the truth.”<br>
Judgment for the plaintiff.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Politicians and the Plunder</span><br>
Several Political Entities were dividing the spoils.<br>
“I will take the management of the prisons,” said a Decent Respect for Public Opinion, “and make a radical change.”<br>
“And I,” said the Blotted Escutcheon, “will retain my present general connection with affairs, while my friend here, the Soiled Ermine, will remain in the Judiciary.”<br>
The Political Pot said it would not boil any more unless replenished from the Filthy Pool.<br>
The Cohesive Power of Public Plunder quietly remarked that the two bosses would, he supposed, naturally be his share.<br>
“No,” said the Depth of Degradation, “they have already fallen to me.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Honourable Member</span><br>
A Member of a Legislature, who had pledged himself to his Constituents not to steal, brought home at the end of the session a large part of the dome of the Capitol.  Thereupon the Constituents held an indignation meeting and passed a resolution of tar and feathers.<br>
“You are most unjust,” said the Member of the Legislature.  “It is true I promised you I would not steal; but had I ever promised you that I would not lie?”<br>
The Constituents said he was an honourable man and elected him to the United States Congress, unpledged and unfledged.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Judge and the Plaintiff</span><br>
A Man of Experience in Business was awaiting the judgment of the Court in an action for damages which he had brought against a railway company.  The door opened and the Judge of the Court entered.<br>
“Well,” said he, “I am going to decide your case to-day.  If I should decide in your favour, I wonder how you would express your satisfaction?”<br>
“Sir,” said the Man of Experience in Business, “I should risk your anger by offering you one half the sum awarded.”<br>
“Did I say I was going to decide that case?” said the Judge, abruptly, as if awakening from a dream.  “Dear me, how absent-minded I am.  I mean I have already decided it, and judgment has been entered for the full amount that you sued for.”<br>
“Did I say I would give you one half?” said the Man of Experience in Business, coldly.  “Dear me, how near I came to being a rascal.  I mean, that I am greatly obliged to you.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Return of the Representative</span><br>
Hearing that the Legislature had adjourned, the people of an Assembly District held a mass-meeting to devise a suitable punishment for their representative.  By one speaker it was proposed that he be disembowelled, by another that he be made to run the gauntlet.  Some favoured hanging, some thought that it would do him good to appear in a suit of tar and feathers.  An old man, famous for his wisdom and his habit of drooling on his shirt-front, suggested that they first catch their hare.  So the Chairman appointed a committee to watch for the victim at midnight, and take him as he should attempt to sneak into town across-lots from the tamarack swamp.  At this point in the proceedings they were interrupted by the sound of a brass band.  Their dishonoured representative was driving up from the railway station in a coach-and-four, with music and a banner.  A few moments later he entered the hall, went upon the platform, and said it was the proudest moment of his life. (Cheers.)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Saint and Sinner</span><br>
“My friend,” said a distinguished officer of the Salvation Army, to a Most Wicked Sinner, “I was once a drunkard, a thief, an assassin.  The Divine Grace has made me what I am.”<br>
The Most Wicked Sinner looked at him from head to foot.  “Henceforth,” he said, “the Divine Grace, I fancy, will let well enough alone.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">An Antidote</span><br>
A Young Ostrich came to its Mother, groaning with pain and with its wings tightly crossed upon its stomach.<br>
“What have you been eating?” the Mother asked, with solicitude.<br>
“Nothing but a keg of Nails,” was the reply.<br>
“What!” exclaimed the Mother; “a whole keg of Nails, at your age!  Why, you will kill yourself that way.  Go quickly, my child, and swallow a claw-hammer.”</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Wolf and the Feeding Goat</span><br>
A Wolf saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a rock, where he could not get at her.<br>
“Why do you stay up there in that sterile place and go hungry?” said the Wolf.  “Down here where I am the broken-bottle vine cometh up as a flower, the celluloid collar blossoms as the rose, and the tin-can tree brings forth after its kind.”<br>
“That is true, no doubt,” said the Goat, “but how about the circus-poster crop?  I hear that it failed this year down there.”<br>
The Wolf, perceiving that he was being chaffed, went away and resumed his duties at the doors of the poor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Life Saver</span><br>
An Ancient Maiden, standing on the edge of a wharf near a Modern Swain, was overheard rehearsing the words:<br>
“Noble preserver!  The life that you have saved is yours!”<br>
Having repeated them several times with various intonations, she sprang into the water, where she was suffered to drown.<br>
“I am a noble preserver,” said the Modern Swain, thoughtfully moving away; “the life that I have saved is indeed mine.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Two Politicians</span><br>
Two Politicians were exchanging ideas regarding the rewards for public service.<br>
“The reward which I most desire,” said the First Politician, “is the gratitude of my fellow-citizens.”<br>
“That would be very gratifying, no doubt,” said the Second Politician, “but, alas! in order to obtain it one has to retire from politics.”<br>
For an instant they gazed upon each other with inexpressible tenderness; then the First Politician murmured, “God’s will be done!  Since we cannot hope for reward, let us be content with what we have.”<br>
And lifting their right hands from the public treasury they swore to be content.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">From the Minutes</span><br>
An Orator afflicted with atrophy of the organ of common-sense rose in his place in the halls of legislation and pointed with pride to his Unblotted Escutcheon.  Seeing what it supposed to be the finger of scorn pointed at it, the Unblotted Escutcheon turned black with rage.  Seeing the Unblotted Escutcheon turning black with what he supposed to be the record of his own misdeeds showing through the whitewash, the Orator fell dead of mortification.  Seeing the Orator fall dead of what they supposed to be atrophy of the organ of common-sense, his colleagues resolved that whenever they should adjourn because they were tired, it should be out of respect to the memory of him who had so frequently made them so.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Three of a Kind</span><br>
A Lawyer in whom an instinct of justice had survived the wreck of his ignorance of law was retained for the defence of a burglar whom the police had taken after a desperate struggle with someone not in custody.  In consultation with his client the Lawyer asked, “Have you accomplices?”<br>
“Yes, sir,” replied the Burglar.  “I have two, but neither has been taken.  I hired one to defend me against capture, you to defend me against conviction.”<br>
This answer deeply impressed the Lawyer, and having ascertained that the Burglar had accumulated no money in his profession he threw up the case.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Appropriate Memorial</span><br>
A High Public Functionary having died, the citizens of his town held a meeting to consider how to honour his memory, and an Other High Public Functionary rose and addressed the meeting.<br>
“Mr. Chairman and Gintlemen,” said the Other, “it sames to me, and I‘m hopin’ yez wull approve the suggistion, that an appropriet way to honour the mimory of the decaised would be to erect an emolument sootably inscribed wid his vartues.”<br>
The soul of the great man looked down from Heaven and wept.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">A Needless Labour</span><br>
After waiting many a weary day to revenge himself upon a Lion for some unconsidered manifestation of contempt, a Skunk finally saw him coming, and posting himself in the path ahead uttered the inaudible discord of his race.  Observing that the Lion gave no attention to the matter, the Skunk, keeping carefully out of reach, said:<br>
“Sir, I beg leave to point out that I have set on foot an implacable odour.”<br>
“My dear fellow,” the Lion replied, “you have taken a needless trouble; I already knew that you were a Skunk.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Mourning Brothers</span><br>
Observing that he was about to die, an Old Man called his two Sons to his bedside and expounded the situation.<br>
“My children,” said he, “you have not shown me many marks of respect during my life, but you will attest your sorrow for my death.  To him who the longer wears a weed upon his hat in memory of me shall go my entire fortune.  I have made a will to that effect.”<br>
So when the Old Man was dead each of the youths put a weed upon his hat and wore it until he was himself old, when, seeing that neither would give in, they agreed that the younger should leave off his weeds and the elder give him half of the estate.  But when the elder applied for the property he found that there had been an Executor!<br>
Thus were hypocrisy and obstinacy fitly punished.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Disinterested Arbiter</span><br>
Two Dogs who had been fighting for a bone, without advantage to either, referred their dispute to a Sheep.  The Sheep patiently heard their statements, then flung the bone into a pond.<br>
“Why did you do that?” said the Dogs.<br>
“Because,” replied the Sheep, “I am a vegetarian.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Justice and His Accuser</span><br>
An eminent Justice of the Supreme Court of Patagascar was accused of having obtained his appointment by fraud.<br>
“You wander,” he said to the Accuser; “it is of little importance how I obtained my power; it is only important how I have used it.”<br>
“I confess,” said the Accuser, “that in comparison with the rascally way in which you have conducted yourself on the Bench, the rascally way in which you got there does seem rather a trifle.”<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Dutiful Son</span><br>
A Millionaire who had gone to an almshouse to visit his father met a Neighbour there, who was greatly surprised.<br>
“What!” said the Neighbour, “you do sometimes visit your father?”<br>
“If our situations were reversed,” said the Millionaire, “I am sure he would visit me.  The old man has always been rather proud of me.  Besides,” he added, softly, “I had to have his signature; I am insuring his life.”</div>
