New alt-media 'superstar influencer' Ian Carroll doesn't care about the facts, as I show in this video. <br>

Apocalypse Now! Watch "An Open Secret" And read about this sickfuck Brian Singer. I have known Ian was a shill since the first time I saw him. This takes it to an entirely new level, like LITERALPedolevel. My friend Josh from WAM called me up and said that there was a picture on FB (where I was long banned, it was in early 2021) of RFKjr with Brock Pierce and he WAS a friend of mine pre-Shmuley. I sent RFK a bunch of links and said that Brock was a Pedo so RFK had the picture removed. He did not post it so he told someone else to delete it. Also Howard Lutnick lived right next door to Epstein for TWENTY FIVE YEARS! He bought the house from him, Wexner and Bronfman. That makes 3 Sex Cults now (Epstein, DEN and NXVIM) Then he bought Epstein's actual house at 9 71st St (Lutnick lives at 11) after the FBI raid. Yet GROK still says they didn't know each other, lol Lutnick also hosted a fundraiser for Hillary at his NYC place in 2016. Trump in 2019. Then another Trump in the Hamptons in 2024.  <br>
3 Sex Cults connected to Chabad Ian Carroll... hmmmm I wonder how Brock's image got rehabbed so well? a lot like Trumps, and the Franklin Scandal Perps, Also explains how Ian came out of nowhere to guide the Epstein case and coverup WW's books and research SHE IS UNHINGED! SO many articles about Brock have been memoryholed. Also there is MUCH more to Lutnick and his Fractional Reserve Stablecoin. Pedos are literally going to drive the world into a slavery CBDC Social Credit system and the Trumptards will cheer it on all the way to their graves.  <br>
<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/strange-saga-jeffrey-epstein-s-link-brock-pierce-1240462/" class="postlink">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifes ... e-1240462/</a> In August 2000, Collins-Rector was indicted for transporting minors across state lines for sex, and the DEN trio took off for Spain. The sojourn there ended in May 2002 when Interpol showed up, finding weapons and thousands of child-porn images in their house. (Pierce has said he was unaware of the images.) While Pierce and Shackley were quickly released, Collins-Rector was was held in a Spanish jail until October 2003 when he was extradited to the U.S. In June 2004 he pleaded guilty to five counts of transporting minors for sex. After serving out his sentence — which, after credit for time served, only amounted to a few months — he left the country and renounced his citizenship. (BuzzFeed tracked him down in Europe in 2014.)  <br>

Apocalypse Now!Joe College The "Comet Trust" sold 11 to Lutnick in 1998. he not only still lives there but he also bought 9 (Jeffs house). But now I think it's been sold to another Crypto Billionaire and ex-Goldman Sachs guy named Michael Daffey. But according to Grok Lutnick did. could be a cover story, cause Grok covers up for Lutnick lile crazy. And speaking of Sachs, I just found out that Jeffrey Sachs was also involved in DEN. So that makes sense too, another disinfo Hollywood clown pretending to be against Israel. <br>
<br>
Joe College There is a 2nd line of shill doctors and experts that no one sees yet.  5 M's they had ready to step in before they announced the pandemic. For when the first narrative inevitably failed; controlling both sides of the narrative.Experts at deceit; hard to prove unless you dig deep into their pasts. I have. So has Housatonic.Live. Real deep. Martin, Malone, McCullough, Mikovits, Madjey (and now McKary). Beware of these shills; they are not your friend.<br>
<br>
designace DEN Network Holy Moly . run. No one serious could ignore this. Thanks Polly you nailed it. This is Data Lounge or CDAN level stuff <br>

Joe College Ian Carroll is just another version of Q and of Tucker. They tell us stuff that is already out there in the public domain and since we are a nation of non-readers with poor memories, it all sounds like freshly baked bread crumbs (like w/ Q). The Q op of late 2017 was actually a re-packaging of George Webb's early 2017 research group. They re-wrote it in Deep Throat style to make it fun for the kids (Deep Throat was Dick Cheney; Woodward's book was fiction).  They just tried the same thing with Catherine Herridge the long time MSM spook. After mentioning the coming Black Swan and then getting fake fired like Tucker, she tried to make a splash reporting that a famous terrorist had gotten USAID funds. The news was from 2010 but Qtards were none the wiser and think she's stunning and brave.  "Al-Qaida terrorist went to school on taxpayer dime"  <br>

Joe College They've recently made it easier to spot their stooges.  About 14 days ago the network handlers put out a directive ordering them to put themselves making ridiculous faces in the thumbnail.  Another form of censorship more subtle is them "flooding the zone" using their controlled narrative network. It was covered in Event 201 but has been around for a while. About 2-3 weeks ago they instructed all their creators to start cranking out short form videos as to cover platform home and search pages and push honest creators off the page. C0nvey used to do this on twitter by using bots to post dozens of tweet w/ huge pictures so 3 or 4 would take up an entire hash page.  The great thing I've seen the last 2 weeks is that they are still hiring new rodeo clowns. When you can recognize the narrative control network's layouts and graphics and merch and party line etc. you can easily spot newbies just hired on. There's a lot of them. That means their rumble all stars and 2nd tier clowns are losing sway.  A lot times when I call out an obvious siocuck I use this video below: "My buddy Gracie turned them down." <br>
<a href="https://rumble.com/v4jbek0-israel-made-me-an-offer-zionist-blood-money-for-influencers-promoting-israe.html" class="postlink">https://rumble.com/v4jbek0-israel-made- ... israe.html</a><br>
<br>
Joe College Make best use of comment sections while we still have them. Crowd sourced research dwarfs anything their spooks can do. B/c dead internet theory &amp; the narrative control network I watch very few videos now but instead surf the comment sections and usually learn more than if I had watched the video--without wasting the time.  Sometimes comments will show me I should watch the video but not very often. Once you know the narrative control network you pretty much know what each stooge will say about any given subject without even watching them. I only watch stooge when I think they might have some kind of inside track on something.  This is why bitchute is so much better than rumble whose comment section is intentionally unfriendly to the users and to ongoing discussions. They do not want us comparing notes. Look what we did to their covid narrative; we forced them to change their plans for us. <br>
Joe College Tavistock has conditioned Americans to think only in binaries. red/blue, Right/Left, black white...to the point that when most of us figure out that A is a lie we automatically presume B must then be true.  <br>
Ezra Pound figured it all out back in about 1918 when he said:  <br>
"The technique of infamy is to create two lies and then get people fighting over which one of those lies is true."  <br>
A good example would be bushclinton; we wasted decades arguing over which of those family of liars was true when they were actually in league since 1965.  <br>
Another example is how they created the Lab leak vs Wet market lie to convince us there was a deadly virus when there was none.<br>
<br>
Eton Thank you, I was just starting to watch a few short video by him. There is a lot more to this Wellness Co/ Rumble Mafia than I ever thot.  <br>
<br>
Joe College There is a thing called a soft disclosure operation that serves 3 purposes; one is to get us ready for what is coming so we're more likely to go along with it a nd the other is used to convince the enemy or target that you have more troops or arms than you really do so that they will be more likely to retreat and surrender. The 3rd is to set parameters for the narrative; what can and can't be talked about  <br>
Dead internet theory says 90% of social media are bots or paid stooges. With very few exceptions, if you've heard of them they're a paid shill. Honest actors are not allowed to rise and get no reach. Just like in politics. I have been on for a long time and survived the Great Larp Wars of 2017 and Jack Dorsey kept me under 3500 followers on Twitter for 2+ years b/c <br>
I knew my bushcinton too well. Carroll rose too fast. It's not natural. Here's how he did it.  <br>

They been planning this alt media psy-op since 2009.  Sam Power’s husband wrote it after Obama beat Hillary with social media in the 2008 primary. Read the "Cures" section; it's today's alt media. Conspiracy Theories: Causes and Cures* - Sunstein-Conspiracy-Theories-2009.pdf<br>
<br>
wings008 the masters of deception use the same old time tested methods...rolling back....Lookout Mountain Laboratory was originally envisioned as an air defense center. Built in 1941 and nestled in two-and-a-half secluded acres off what is now Wonderland Park Avenue, the installation was hidden from view and surrounded by an electrified fence. By 1947, the facility featured a fully operational movie studio. In fact, it is claimed that it was perhaps the world’s only completely self-contained movie studio. With 100,000 square feet of floor space, the covert studio included sound stages, screening rooms, film processing labs, editing facilities, an animation department, and seventeen climate-controlled film vaults. It also had underground parking, a helicopter pad and a bomb shelter. <br>
the studio produced some 19,000 classified motion pictures  <br>
the facility was run by the U.S. Air Force <br>
process AEC footage of atomic and nuclear bomb tests.  indications that Lookout Mountain Laboratory had an advanced research and development department that was on the cutting edge of new film technologies 3-D effects were apparently first developed at the Laurel Canyon site <br>
Hollywood luminaries like John Ford, Jimmy Stewart, Howard Hawks, Ronald Reagan, Bing Crosby, Walt Disney and Marilyn Monroe were given clearance to work at the facility on undisclosed projects. The facility retained as many as 250 producers, directors, technicians, editors, animators, etc., both civilian and military, all with top security clearances – and all reporting to work in a secluded corner of Laurel Canyon. the secret bunker had been up and running for more than twenty years before Laurel Canyon’s rebellious teen years, and it remained operational for the most turbulent of those years The existence of the facility remained unknown to the general public until the early 1990<br>
