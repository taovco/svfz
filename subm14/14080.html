<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"It is of great importance to straighten out this inverting of the relationship, criticizing Christ by Paul, the Master by the disciple." <br>
Kierkegaard, My Task (1855)</div></blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"No sooner had Jesus knocked over the menacing dragons of religious dogma and spiritual superstition than the 'apostle' Paul boldly set them back upright again. In truth, there is not one word of Pauline Christianity to be found in the gospel utterances of Jesus, and there has thus never been a more monstrous imposition perpetrated than the one where the Christian religion imposed Paul's soul upon the soul of Christ - and this, in Jesus' name no less! Almost as egregious, this fresh doctrine of Paul's was one that sought not to topple or even significantly alter the unjust political systems of its day, but was rather designed to coddle them and the corrupt delegates who ran them. As such, it can come as no surprise that The Way of Jesus Christ was suppressed by the time's political world and was adopted as its official faith." - George Bernard Shaw</div></blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Paul avoids quoting the teaching of Jesus, in fact even mentioning the same. In truth, if we had to rely on Paul, we would not know that Jesus taught in parables, we would not know that Jesus had ever delivered the Sermon on the Mount, nor that he had taught his disciples the 'Our Father.' Indeed, even where they are specially relevant, Paul blatantly ignores the words of his Lord... Paul obviously did not desire to truly know Christ. And the fateful thing is that the Greek, the Catholic, and the Protestant theologies all contain the Gospel of Paul in a form which does not continue the Gospel of Jesus, but rather wholly displaces it." - Albert Schweitzer</div></blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Fundamentalism is nothing more than the triumph of Paul over Jesus... Paul created a theology of which none but the vaguest warrants can be found in the words of Christ; a theology about the man instead of his teachings - a man who Paul never even knew and a theology written some 50 or more years after the death of that same man... Paul replaced moral conduct with mere creed as the test of Virtue. It is in no way an understatement to say that this was quite the tragic shift. " - Will Durant</div></blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"The name 'disciple of Jesus' has little applicability to Paul, with the obvious contradictions in the three accounts given by him in regard to his Road to Damascus conversion being more than enough to arouse a palpable distrust in the man The moral majesty of Jesus -- his purity and piety, his ministry among the people, his manner as a prophet, the concrete ethical-religious content of his earthly life - signifies very little whatsoever for Paul's Christology. As such we are confronted with Jesus or Paul: the fundamental choice that all are required to make; the choice that embodies the primary spiritual battleground of our present day." - William Wrede</div></blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wrede" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wrede</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"The conversion of Paul was no conversion at all: instead it was Paul converting a lifestyle that raised one man above sin and death into a religion that has delivered millions of men so completely into their own dominion that their common nature has become a horror to them, and their religious life a denial of life itself." - George Bernard Shaw</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Paul was the very first corrupter of the doctrine of Jesus Christ; a doctrine very different from the one practiced by those who would call me infidel while elevating themselves as preachers of the Gospel Indeed, these "Christian" impostors have compounded from the Halcyon Mysteries a religious system fully beyond the comprehension of humankind, one of which the greatest ethical reformer of the Jews, were he to return to Earth today, would not recognize a single feature." - Thomas Jefferson</div></blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>John 8:31-32 KJV<br>
31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<br>
32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John 13:35 KJV<br>
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John 14:23 KJV<br>
Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John 15:7 KJV<br>
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John 15:10 KJV<br>
If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.</div></blockquote>

4 But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.</div></blockquote>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Commandments</span><br>
<br>
Exodus 20:3-17 English Standard Version
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>3 “You shall have no other gods before me.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>4 “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. <br>
5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, <br>
6 but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>7 “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>8 “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <br>
9 Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, <br>
10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. <br>
11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>12 “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>17 “You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.”</div></blockquote>

None of the Levitical temple laws have applied since 70 A.D., when the Jerusalem temple was destroyed. This includes tithing and circumcision, imo.<br>
The Morality Laws do apply. sorry fellas<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Leviticus  chapters 17 - 26</div></blockquote>
Some of the laws in the "Code of Righteousness". Morality, food and health laws. A lot of common sense is in those chapters.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Acts 15:19-21 English Standard Version<br>
19 Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, <br>
20 but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. <br>
21 For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”</div></blockquote>

<br>
All the words of Jesus, spoken to Paul. Allegedly.<br>
Condensed and taken out of context so as to view the scarcity. And I do mean scarcity.<br>
It seems Paul's savior spent some time going to Greek Plays. Who knew?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<br>
<br>
I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.<br>
<br>
Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.<br>
<br>
Ananias! Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.<br>
<br>
Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.<br>
<br>
Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace; for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city.<br>
<br>
It is more blessed to give than to receive.<br>
<br>
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<br>
<br>
I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.<br>
<br>
Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.<br>
<br>
Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.<br>
<br>
Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.<br>
<br>
Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.<br>
<br>
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.<br>
<br>
I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.<br>
<br>
But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctioned by faith that is in me.<br>
<br>
My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2 Corinthians 12:7-9 King James Version<br>
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.<br>
8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.<br>
9 And he said unto me, <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</span> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</div></blockquote>
Jesus told his followers to drive out the demons. If Paul couldn't do it himself, why didn't he ask one of his own disciples to do it for him?<br>
Why didn't he just ask Peter and James for some help dealing with this Angel of Satan? Maybe he should have stopped eating at Pagan Temples, and tried fasting and prayer. I seem to recall that being in Jesus' teachings. <br>
Poor brother Paul.<br>
<br>
<br>
I, I, I, Me, Me, Me, My, My, My, We, We, We.<br>
There's a lot of that in Paul's writings<br>
I've always wanted to count how many times the ever so humble Paul, made it all about himself. I ain't got that kinda time. Too daunting.<br>
They now teach Hebrews couldn't have been written by Paul, because he didn't mention himself enough times. It just wasn't his style.</div>

			<div class="content">Thanks SWMBO, I'm interested in this but there are too many examples! In building up the "weight of evidence" by sheer quantity they've necessarily included some which are a bit dubious and unconvincing, which probably detract from the better ones.<br>
<br>
I'd be looking for, say, 2 or 3 good examples of clear differences between Paul's and Jesus' teachings.<br>
<br>
I've often thought that Paul was the "showman" who took Jesus on the road and made him popular. We should certainly thank Paul for that, but it does raise questions about his authenticity.</div>

			<div class="content">• <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Jesus Says Not To Eat Meat Sacrificed to Idols, But Paul Says It Is Ok</span>.<br>
<br>
Paul did not know about DNA, hormones, or any other science. He thought that meat from a pagan temple sacrifice couldn't be different from other meat. But he was wrong. <br>
The Hebrew laws about meat eating include humane killing of the animal, and draining of the blood (see Levitical Laws). Good hunters know this, why doesn't Paul?<br>
The pagans would torture and terrify the sacrifice to maximize the amount of adrenalin in the blood. We aren't even supposed to eat blood (see medical studies on consumption of blood). Paul could not have known the science and why God told us not to eat blood. His god was a false god. And not a very good scientist.<br>

But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.</div></blockquote>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Jesus says.</span>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Rev. 2:6 (Ephesus)<br>
But you have this to your credit: You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</div></blockquote>
Some Aramaic Scholars suggest 'Nicolaitans' translates into, 'let-us-eat-ers', from the Greek. If this is true then Jesus has a great sense of humor.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Rev. 2:14-15 (Pergamum)<br>
14 But I have a few things against you, because some of you hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a stumbling block before the Israelites so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality. 15 In the same way, some of you also hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Revelation 2:20 (Thyatira)<br>
But I have against thee a few things: That thou dost suffer the woman Jezebel, who is calling herself a prophetess, to teach, and to lead astray, my servants to commit whoredom, and idol-sacrifices to eat.</div></blockquote>

People always use Matthew 15:11 to say, "Jesus said we could eat anything". He was clearly using the question to drive home the point that sin is much worse than not washing your hands.<br>
<br>
Matthew 15:1-20<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,<br>
2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</div></blockquote>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">James' ruling at the Jerusalem Council. </span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Acts 15:20<br>
but to write to them to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and the whoredom, and the strangled thing; and the blood.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Acts 15:29<br>
to abstain from things offered to idols, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom; from which keeping yourselves, ye shall do well; be strong!</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Acts 21:25<br>
And concerning those of the nations who have believed, we have written, having given judgment, that they observe no such thing, except to keep themselves both from idol-sacrifices, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom.</div></blockquote>

Acts 15:22-26
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</div></blockquote>

They sent chief men with Paul and Barnabas.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>23 And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</div></blockquote>

Letters for the chief men, not Paul. Paul never could get a letter from the Apostles. He tried very hard, they weren't having any of it.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:<br>
25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</div></blockquote>

Chosen men went with Paul. He wasn't chosen for anything. Paul wasn't even beloved, like Barnabas was.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</div></blockquote>

Again, this is referring to the chosen men, not Paul.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Paul taught. </span><br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 8:4-13<br>
Contemporary English Version<br>
This is the clearest version of Paul's word salad I could find.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>8:4-6<br>
4 Even though food is offered to idols, we know that none of the idols in this world are alive. After all, there is only one God. <br>
5 Many things in heaven and on earth are called gods and lords, but none of them really are gods or lords. <br>
6 We have only one God, and he is the Father. He created everything, and we live for him. Jesus Christ is our only Lord. Everything was made by him, and by him life was given to us.</div></blockquote>

Does Satan knows he's not a god (elohim)? Or, that he is not a lord (master, ruler), over anyone? What about the Prince of Persia? Mastema? Gabriel? Michael? Raphael? Aren't they real gods?<br>
Didn't Paul ever read Enoch? You know, in the temple, studying to be a Pharisee? Didn't anyone teach him about 'the gods'? He musta went to a 'Public Synagogue'.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>8:7-8<br>
7 Not everyone knows these things. In fact, many people have grown up with the belief that idols have life in them. So when they eat meat offered to idols, they are bothered by a weak conscience. <br>
8 But food doesn't bring us any closer to God. We are no worse off if we don't eat, and we are no better off if we do.</div></blockquote>

Weak conscience? The people who grew up in pagan temples witnessed their 'meat' being tortured, killed and cooked. Drank blood, ate blood pudding. What about the cannibalistic idol worshipers, who ate human flesh, drank human blood? What about Haggis? Yuk! Learn from pagan history and science.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>8:9-10<br>
9 Don't cause problems for someone with a weak conscience, just because you have the right to eat anything. <br>
10 You know all this, and so it doesn't bother you to eat in the temple of an idol. But suppose a person with a weak conscience sees you and decides to eat food that has been offered to idols.</div></blockquote>

You have the right to eat anything, just don't get caught. Bullshit!<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>8:11-13<br>
11 Then what you know has destroyed someone Christ died for. <br>
12 When you sin by hurting a follower with a weak conscience, you sin against Christ. <br>
13 So if I hurt one of the Lord's followers by what I eat, <strong class="text-strong">I will never eat meat as long as I live</strong>.</div></blockquote>

What a Drama Queen. How about if we just Stay Out of Pagan Temples! Why couldn't Paul give this simple advice?<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 10:19-29<br>
Contemporary English Version<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>19 Am I saying that either the idols or the food sacrificed to them is anything at all? <br>
20  No, I am not! This food is really sacrificed to demons and not to God. I don't want you to have anything to do with demons. <br>
21 You cannot drink from the cup of demons and still drink from the Lord's cup. You cannot eat at the table of demons and still eat at the Lord's table. <br>
22  We would make the Lord jealous if we did this. And we are not stronger than the Lord.</div></blockquote>

But Paul said earlier,
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>8:4-5<br>
4 Even though food is offered to idols, we know that none of the idols in this world are alive. After all, there is only one God. <br>
5 Many things in heaven and on earth are called gods and lords, but none of them really are gods or lords. </div></blockquote>
I wish he'd make up his mind. What a yoyo.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>10:23-26<br>
23  Some of you say, “We can do whatever we want to!” But I tell you not everything may be good or helpful. <br>
24 We should think about others and not about ourselves. <br>
25 However, when you buy meat in the market, go ahead and eat it. Keep your conscience clear by not asking where the meat came from. <br>
26  The Scriptures say, “The earth and everything in it belong to the Lord.”</div></blockquote>

Paul already said, "<strong class="text-strong">You have the right to eat anything</strong>". Didn't he?
<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">However, when you buy meat in the market, go ahead and eat it. Keep your conscience clear by not asking where the meat came from.</strong></div></blockquote> <br>
Not a very good piece of advice. Definitely the '<strong class="text-strong">Dumbest Man Ever</strong>'.<br>
Did any of the real Apostles say anything that stupid or uninspired?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>10:27-29<br>
27 If an unbeliever invites you to dinner, and you want to go, then go. Eat whatever you are served. Don't cause a problem for someone's conscience by asking where the food came from. <br>
28-29 But if you are told it has been sacrificed to idols, don't cause a problem by eating it. I don't mean a problem for yourself, but for the one who told you. Why should my freedom be limited by someone else's conscience?</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">"Why should my freedom be limited?"</span></div></blockquote>
And there it is.<br>
<br>
I wonder if Paul knew about all the sex acts and orgies going on in the pagan temples?<br>
I wonder how many naughty things a person had to participate in, before they could eat the meat and drink the blood?<br>
I wonder what Yah thinks?</div>

Paul's private letter to Timothy. (Ephesus)<br>
<br>
These are Paul's rules for the widows who don't have anyone left to care for them.<br>
If a widow lives 20 years past her life expectancy and never remarries, then the church can help her.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 Timothy 5:9<br>
Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man.</div></blockquote>
What if she's 50? No.<br>
What if she's been widowed twice? Nope.<br>
What if she's under 60 and just needs some help getting back to her family? Absolutely not. It's 60 or nuthin.<br>
<br>
How is a widow under 60 expected to live? Professional Beggar? Prostitution? Paul doesn't seem to care.<br>
Why?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 Timothy 5:11<br>
But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;</div></blockquote>
Don't help the young widows, make them remarry. Shameless Hussies!<br>
If young widows marry again, it's because they're wanton against Christ. But Paul says they're supposed to marry again.<br>
Maybe he thinks that only virgins go to 'heaven'? Notice how this rule would prevent these women from ever receiving help.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 Timothy 5:14<br>
14 I will therefore that the younger women (widows) marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</div></blockquote>

Young widows need to marry again, have more children with a different father. And everyone lives happily ever after. Another Stellar Piece of Advice from, the <strong class="text-strong">Dumbest Man Ever</strong>.<br>
Why is Paul so concerned with excluding most, if not all of the widows from receiving help in Ephesus? <br>
Why no rules like this for the widows of Corinth?<br>
<br>
It's to make sure that men who run the church have double portions to give themselves, instead of giving to the poor, like Jesus told them to.<br>

9 Don't take along any gold, silver, or copper coins. 10  And don't carry a traveling bag or an extra shirt or sandals or a walking stick. Workers deserve their food.</div></blockquote>
Workers deserve their wages/food for the actual physical labor they do, as payment from their hosts in the town. Not for spreading the Gospel. <br>

Don't forget to put the priests in grand palaces, with lots of temple prostitutes, and give them a double portion, while the poor starve. <br>

24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,<br>
25 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.<br>

14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</div></blockquote>

Paul called himself an Apostle, no one who met him did. He had the nerve to call himself the apostle to the gentiles. That was The Apostle Peter's calling, not Paul's. Robbing Peter to pay Paul, has an older and different meaning than I thought.<br>
What did he do after Damascus? He spent 14+ years in Arabia, and elsewhere (see Paul's mystery years). Someone must have told him there was a terrific 'Apostles Academy' there. Which Apostle did he study under? That teacher was terrible!<br>
Maybe he was learning how to supplement his 'tentmaker/circus/stagehand' income, by robbing widows. idk</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Matthew 23:1-15 King James Version<br>
1 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,<br>
2 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:<br>
3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.<br>
4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.<br>
5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,<br>
6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,<br>
7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.<br>
8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.<br>
9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.<br>
10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.<br>
11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.<br>
12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.<br>
13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.<br>
14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.<br>
15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Acts 23:6 King James Version<br>
6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Matthew 23:25-29 King James Version<br>
25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.<br>
26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.<br>
27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.<br>
28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.<br>
29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Luke 11:39-43 King James Version<br>
39 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.<br>
40 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?<br>
41 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.<br>
42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.<br>
43 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</div></blockquote>

26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. <br>
27 Then Barnabas brought him to the apostles and described how Saul had seen the Lord, who had spoken to him on the road to Damascus, and how Saul had spoken boldly in that city in the name of Jesus.<br>
28 So Saul stayed with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. <br>
29 He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him. <br>
30 When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.<br>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">God as my witness! I do not lie! I tell the truth!</span><br>
<br>
Paul doth protest too much, methinks.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Romans 3:7 Common English Bible<br>
But if God’s truth is demonstrated by <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">my lie</span> and it increases his glory, why am I still judged as a <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">sinner</span>?</div></blockquote>
Umm, because you're a sinful liar?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Romans 9:1 Common English Bible<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">I’m speaking the truth in Christ—I’m not lying</span>, as my conscience assures me with the Holy Spirit:</div></blockquote>
What lie did the romans accuse him of?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 Thessalonians 2:5 Common English Bible<br>
As you know, we never used flattery, and <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">God is our witness</span> that we didn’t have <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">greedy motives</span>.</div></blockquote>
I wonder what those poor widows in Ephesus would have said about his motives?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Galatians 1:20 Common English Bible<br>
Before God, <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">I’m not lying</span> about the things that I’m writing to you!
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Philippians 1:18 - Common English Bible<br>
What do I think about this? Just this: since Christ is proclaimed in every possible way, <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">whether from dishonest or true motives</span>, I’m glad and I’ll continue to be glad.</div></blockquote>
I'm certainly glad, one of us is glad.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 Timothy 2:7 Common English Bible<br>
I was appointed to be a preacher and apostle of this testimony—<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">I’m telling the truth</span> and <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">I’m not lying!</span> I’m a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</div></blockquote>
Now give me my double cut from the widows and orphans fund!<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2 Corinthians 1:23 Common English Bible<br>
I call on <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">God as my witness</span>—I didn’t come again to Corinth because I wanted to spare you.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2 Corinthians 11:31 Common English Bible<br>
The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, the one who is blessed forever, knows that <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">I’m not lying</span>.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2 Corinthians 12:16 Common English Bible<br>
We all know that I didn’t place a burden on you, but in spite of that you think <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">I’m a con artist who fooled you with a trick</span>.</div></blockquote>
I didn't even burden your widows, like I did in Ephesus.<br>
Con Artist and Trickster. Yeah, that about sums it up.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2 Corinthians 12:19 Common English Bible<br>
Have you been thinking up to now that we are defending ourselves to you? Actually, we are<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> speaking in the sight of God and in Christ</span>. Dear friends, everything is meant to build you up.</div></blockquote>
He must have told some whoppers to the people of Corinth.<br>
<br>
I dare any parent to tell me Paul wasn't a liar. <br>
Did any of the Apostles have to assure people they weren't lying all the time?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">God says.</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Exodus 20:16 King James Version<br>
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Isaiah 44:25 King James Version<br>
That frustrateth the tokens of the <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">liars</span>, and maketh <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">diviners mad</span>; that turneth wise men <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">backward</span>, and maketh their knowledge <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">foolish</span>;</div></blockquote>
It's like God might have had some foreknowledge of Paul's ministry.<br>
<br>
There's more here: Psalm 116:11; Proverbs 17:4, 19:22, 30:6<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Jesus says.</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John 8:44 King James Version<br>
Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</div></blockquote>
Pay attention Paul.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John 8:55 King James Version<br>
Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</div></blockquote>
You never met him paul. You don't even know what he taught.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Revelation 2:2 King James Version (Ephesus)<br>
I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</div></blockquote>
It was the Apostle John who stepped in at Ephesus and fixed the damage Paul had done. Read The Acts of Timothy.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Revelation 21:8 King James Version<br>
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">murderers,</span> and whoremongers, and <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">sorcerers</span>, and idolaters, and <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">all liars</span>, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</div></blockquote>
Well, at least he'll have a warm reception.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">John says.</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 John 1:10 King James Version<br>
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 John 2:4 King James Version<br>
He that saith, <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">I know him, and keepeth not his commandments</span>, is a<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> liar</span>, and the<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> truth is not in him</span>.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 John 4:20 King James Version<br>
20 If a man say, <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">I love God</span>, and <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">hateth his brother</span>, he is a<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> liar</span>: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? </div></blockquote>
Yeah Paul! Stop going around wishing for men to chop their sexual organs off! Why not pray for them?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 John 5:10 King James Version<br>
10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son</span>.</div></blockquote>
You know he's talking about the commandments. Right, Paul?<br>
<br>
Paul: <blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">"Why should my freedom be limited?"</span></div></blockquote>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Paul lied in court too.</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Did Paul Deliberately Lie in Court in Acts 23:6-7?<br>
<a href="https://www.jesuswordsonly.org/topicindex/427-did-paul-ever-deliberately-lie.html" class="postlink">https://www.jesuswordsonly.org/topicind ... y-lie.html</a><br>

The lawyer explains it well.<br>
<br>
TL/DR: <span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%">Of course he lied! Are you nuts?</span> And all the widows shouted,<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%"> "Amen"</span></div>

He couldn't stand to look in their eyes, They knew he was a Twinky. And he probably couldn't be heard very well over their jeers and hisses.<br>
I'd have slingshot his feckless fanny. He didn't have a rule about that!</div>

If you want more, I'll have to write 'The Snarky Girls Guide to Understanding Paul', available at Amazon.<br>

If you want more, I'll have to write 'The Snarky Girls Guide to Understanding Paul', available at Amazon.

I'd read that ❤️

Thank you. It's only because you like to laugh at retards. but if you're serious....<br>
How fast can you type?  Never mind, i know you got me beat. I can use up to 4-5 fingers, instead of just two. progress is slow.<br>
Editting skills?<br>
How's your spilling? Gramma?<br>
Ho'ws your punctuation?<br>
Can you translate snarky girl into soft spoken gentlelady, for business purposes?<br>
What are your wages? I'd be giving it away for free you know.<br>
How soon will you be available?</div>

I could, but that would be at the expense of your "voice", which is too valuable.<br>

It just so happens that my only fixed commitment finishes next week. I have lots of ideas and plans to pursue, and if you're serious this could be one of them.</div>

As soon as i get the library set back up, we've got to start building a bathroom. Those take forever.<br>
But you know, if you want a snarky opinion from me, all you gotta do is post something. If I've got an opinion, I'll let you know all about it.<br>

What's wrong with being snarky and potty-mouthed? :)<br>

</div></blockquote>

Silly boy, don't you know? The rule is sugar and spice, and everything nice. I failed that class. I could live with the snarkiness, but the potty mouth really needs to go. I know you can't tell, but my vocabulary is good enough that I shouldn't be vulgar. I just spend too much time around guys, so I'm blaming them. Cuz i can!<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'm sorry to hear that. It wasn't an offer to help so much as an expressed wish to collaborate.</div></blockquote>
Ok collaborator, I went first now it's your turn. Pick a paul, any paul.<br>
I'll go get the antacid. I'm going to need it.</div>

<br>
I'm thinking about how to make the message accessible, compelling, attractive. I'm really interested in screenplays at the moment, and they are in high demand because there are so many streaming services crying out for original material. There's plenty of money for movie &amp; TV series production (famous names, cast of thousands, remote locations) but a desperate shortage of good stories.<br>
<br>
So I've been thinking about a biopic of Paul but not as a "saint" but as a desperate-for-attention "showman". He might even be <em class="text-italics">faking</em> his epiphany on the road to Damascus.<br>
<br>
Are we on the same page regarding Jesus and Paul? Jesus being the one true God, Paul sort-of cashing in.<br>
<br>
I became a Catholic only about 8 years ago, after 40 years as an Atheist and then 15 years as a Christian. I don't know much about the founding of the Church and I hope you can help me with that. Did Peter and Paul found the church?<br>
<br>
It's tempting to take this conversation private - but I'd prefer not to. Let the record stand.</div>

			<div class="content">A biopic of paul sounds good. I've had quite a few movies run through my head, on that dude over the years. One of the less dark thoughts about him is that he was the PT Barnum of his time. The movies that i think of, as I learn more things, are very dark. My problem with movies is, I only like comedies and pauls only funny to me, when I'm making fun of him.<br>
I'm not a classic trinitarian. I think linearly - The Father is &gt; His Son is &gt; The Holy Spirit. When I try to combine them into one, it looks like a snake eating its own tail, to me. I'd need someone to prove that they are all interchangeable within their hierarchy to be able to understand "The Trinity". And, they have to explain it to me without using Paul. In other words I don't understand how it all works, but I know he'll give me the answer, when I need it. If I'm working on following his instructions, the rest will come. I tried to be an atheist at 16, it lasted until 18-19. I think my label is Contrarian Christian, not sure, but know I'm quite contrary.

</div></blockquote>
Jesus established the church, all his real Apostles and disciples spread the branches and did the grafting. Paul took an axe and did what his roman masters told him to do. That's my opinion, as of today. My opinion of paul is everchanging though.<br>
<br>
If you're going to work on a movie script, wouldn't it best to discuss that in DM?<br>
Also, if you write a scene with some old woman beating the stuffing out of paul, I'm definitely in for that!<br>
Sorry it took so long to reply, had to do dinner and dishes. I'm pooped.</div>

One of the less dark thoughts about him is that he was the PT Barnum of his time.

Just what I had in mind. Now make it darker...<br>

The movies that i think of, as I learn more things, are very dark. My problem with movies is, I only like comedies and pauls only funny to me, when I'm making fun of him.

We can do anything we want. We can make Paul ridiculous, or evil, or lecherous (do chicks dig Jesus and Paul's picking up the groupies?), or funny, or anything really.<br>

I'm not a classic trinitarian. I think linearly - The Father is &gt; His Son is &gt; The Holy Spirit. When I try to combine them into one, it looks like a snake eating its own tail, to me. I'd need someone to prove that they are all interchangeable within their hierarchy to be able to understand "The Trinity". And, they have to explain it to me without using Paul. In other words I don't understand how it all works, but I know he'll give me the answer, when I need it. If I'm working on following his instructions, the rest will come. I tried to be an atheist at 16, it lasted until 18-19. I think my label is Contrarian Christian, not sure, but know I'm quite contrary.

It's all good, so long as you and I are both praying to the same Bloke. I'm comfortable not understanding the details.<br>

 Did Peter and Paul found the church?<br>
It's tempting to take this conversation private - but I'd prefer not to. Let the record stand.
</div></blockquote>
Jesus established the church, all his real Apostles and disciples spread the branches and did the grafting. Paul took an axe and did what his roman masters told him to do. That's my opinion, as of today. My opinion of paul is everchanging though.
</div></blockquote>

I meant the Roman Catholic church, in Rome, at the Vatican. I think Peter was the first "bishop" i.e. pope and the mantle has passed down in an unbroken line since then? Was Paul involved too? I don't know much.<br>

Just what I had in mind. Now make it darker...</div></blockquote>

Darker like what? Personal behavior, ambition, end goals, who's controlling him? Several different paths to take on each subject.  I have only thought of him as a roman/edomite spy, for a long time.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We can do anything we want. We can make Paul ridiculous, or evil, or lecherous (do chicks dig Jesus and Paul's picking up the groupies?), or funny, or anything really.</div></blockquote>
 <br>
I already consider paul to be ridiculous, evil, lecherous, possible pedofag. what's left?  I don't think groupies were a thing in the 1st century. 95%+ of people were busy with their survival. Jesus' disciples had to leave everything behind in order to follow him. Mostly single men, a few married, and even fewer women. All reports of of his appearance make him sound plain and ordinary. Just a regular guy. <br>
As for paul, there's NO WAY he had female groupies, except maybe Thecla. I think you should look for his physical descriptions online. I laughed so hard, i almost peed.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I meant the Roman Catholic church, in Rome, at the Vatican. I think Peter was the first "bishop" i.e. pope and the mantle has passed down in an unbroken line since then? Was Paul involved too? I don't know much.</div></blockquote>

iirc The first pope was another dude. rcc online would know. I rejected rcc at age 5, after 1st and only, one-on-one encounter with a 'penguin'. I said I'd never go again, and i didn't. You would know more abour their teachings than I would.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Let's make it the opening scene, before the credits :)</div></blockquote>

Then you'd have to do the rest of the movie in 'flashbacks' There wouldn't be much left, after she got done. Paul couldn't even wup my mom, and she's mega-old. I hope she doesn't see this.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As and when I think of something I may add it to this thread, but there's no need to feel any urgency to respond. I'm always interested in your thoughts and ideas.

My thoughts are almost always questions. Like what if the roman soldier in Act 21:37-38 was correct, 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists into the desert some time ago?”</div></blockquote>
Hey paul. Are you?</div>

Wow I'd never heard of her. Looked briefly at wikipedia. Her relationship with Paul has real potential as a foundation for the story. What do we know about her?<br>
<br>
Can she be the one beating him up at the start?</div>

			<div class="content">Edomite is a descendant of Esau. God hated Esau, even before he was born. Esau was a race traitor, married forbidden women. i think he prolly tapped anything that moved, as long as it was verboten. His "tribe' may have vanished, but his DNA hasn't. It can be traced to Italy/Rome, Russia, Khazars(ukraine,tukey), china, Greece. I've forgotten a lot of the DNA stuff, but i remember those. The Silk Road.<br>
Paul says he's related to the Herodians (Israel/Edom mix), they were the high priests in Jerusalem (stolen), local rulers/kings of Judea, related by DNA to Rome. If its born with an ugly nose, it's probably an edomite, anegro, or a mix. I think 'khazarian cunt' sounds much better than 'a jew', don't you?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What was Paul doing for Rome?</div></blockquote>
black ops. I think he may have done a lot of things that he hasn't gotten credit for. Oh look, a miniseries!!!<br>
<br>
I barely remember what i read about Paul and Thecla. I thought is was all BS, wiki seems to cover most of it.  I will not be studying rcc fairy tales any time soon, that's on you. Too pagan, too boring, too khazarian. maybe if i get insomnia.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Can she be the one beating him up at the start?</div></blockquote>
It's your movie. Thecla would have been a disciple of Paul, not a poor widow who's been robbed.<br>
Maybe he should be beaten by a mob of women, taking turns? How about a mob of women beating him and all his disciples/followers? Like the mobs of women who shut down saloons before American prohibition. They used axes and clubs. The drunks mostly pissed themselves and ran. good stuff!<br>
It could be a running gag. Every city had widows.<br>
<br>
If you want more options for plots, I think you really need to study this subject, then you can give me the highlights. I haven't tackled it yet.

E: None of this means that salvation isn't offered to Edom. It just makes it easier to see what happened. Also, Jacob shouldn't be blamed for Esau's crimes.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Another reason why this cannot be done is that it is impossible to force a man to believe that which he does not believe, -- that is, to fill his relation to God, -- and because he who knows that faith is the relation of man to God cannot wish to determine the relations of another man to God through force or fraud.</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">Paul's First Trial Before Caesar - A Short Drama</strong><br>

<a href="https://www.jesuswordsonly.org/books/186-pauls-trial-before-caesar-a-drama.html" class="postlink">https://www.jesuswordsonly.org/books/18 ... drama.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>There are no records or even historical records of this trial except the outcome of Paul's release. So below we re-enact the likely issues of that first trial with what we believe are likely and plausible details.</div></blockquote>

Trophimus the Ephesian - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophimus" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophimus</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He was with Paul in Jerusalem, and the Jews, supposing that the apostle had brought him into the temple, raised a tumult which resulted in Paul's imprisonment.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Trophimus is also mentioned in 2 Timothy 4:20: "Trophimus I left at Miletus sick."</div></blockquote>
What if paul wrote that to Timothy in order to cover up his involvement in Trophimus' death? Would anyone know what really happened with nero?<br>
@<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13022" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">FeathersMcGraw</a>, this is an example of how dark one event in paul's ministry can be. imo</div>

Interesting, although in Del Tondo's account Caesar says "to make sure you understand your responsibility for his death, it is you who must perform the execution of Trophimus at the sixth hour of today." But I don't think there's any supporting scripture for that, is there? That would be truly damning.
</div></blockquote>

There's no record that i know of. It's the lawyer's imagination. Nero making Paul be the executioner is pretty dark. <br>
Trophimus would have been killed for what he did, Luke never said he was innocent. Why didn't it get recorded in Acts? If he was released by the romans, that would have been a victory for paul and his followers. I think Paul would have been boasting if Trophimus had been released. Instead, paul ditched him because he got sick, allegedly.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Do you think that Paul was consciously trying to create his own cult, piggy-backing on Jesus? Or what do you think his motivation was?</div></blockquote>
He was piggy backing on Peter and the other Apostles, imo. Paul never knew Jesus' teachings, he couldn't be bothered. I've wondered if the reason Nero started torching christians was because of how crazy paul acted.<br>
His motives could be many. It depends on his allegiances.<br>
Paul was wealthy, well educated, a world traveler. Was he demon possessed from eating idol meat? Herodian spy? Roman spy? <br>
Paul's actions were:<br>
1 - Arrest, imprison and kill the followers of Jesus.<br>
2 - Try to get Apostles approval.<br>
3 - Interfere with the Apostles teachings.<br>
then<br>
4 - Replace the teachings of Jesus with his own, roman approved rhetoric. <br>
He was teaching the 'Secret Knowledge', those mean ol' Apostles wouldn't share. Allegedly.<br>
<br>
E:<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Why didn't James come to Paul's rescue?<br>
(The Trophimus incident)</strong><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200204071545/http://www.judaismvschristianity.com/trophimus_incident.htm" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20200204071 ... cident.htm</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">Introduction</strong><br>
Acts 21:26-31 records the account of Paul's arrest for ostensibly bringing a Gentile into the temple. In the account, the "Jews from Asia " (modern Turkey ) were obviously well aware of what Paul had been teaching in Asia . Ephesus was a prominent city of Asia . When Paul was in the temple providing the animal sacrifices for the purification rites of four Nazirites at James's behest to ostensibly prove to everyone that he still kept the law of Moses, these Asian Jews spotted Paul and leveled the following accusation against him. <br>
"Men of Israel , help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, the law, and this place, and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place." <br>
Immediately after this in verse 29, Luke makes this interesting quasi-defense for Paul.<br>
“For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.”  <br>
This argument as it stands would have an impossible time holding up in court. It would be absurd to suggest that simply having seen Paul with a Gentile in the city would have been grounds on which to convict him of actually bringing that Gentile into the temple. No one would make that argument. Jews and Gentiles mingled outside the temple all the time. It should be apparent that there must be more to the story here …and probably something that Luke would really rather not reveal to us. Therefore, we are forced to read between the lines and logically put the missing pieces of the puzzle together.<br>
Now if Trophimus had gone into the temple and been caught, and Paul was responsible for putting it in his mind to go there on his own, then we have a different story.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">First: Trophimus was caught in the temple</strong><br>
<br>
It is evident that Trophimus had indeed been caught in the temple. Here is the flow of logic:<br>
The Jews of Asia could not have been referring to the Nazirites with Paul in the temple at that time as "Greeks". (No Jew would have confused a Nazirite for a Gentile.) <br>
If no Gentile had been in the temple at all, it would have been Paul’s and Luke's first and only-necessary line of defense!<br>
If no Gentile had been in the temple, James most certainly would have come to Paul’s rescue and reassured the “many myriads of Jews” which he led that such was the case.  Therefore: <br>
Some Gentile had obviously defiled the temple.<br>
The fact that Luke is compelled to mention Trophimus by name is telling. Obviously, he was the one being prosecuted for being in the temple. If Trophimus had not been the one who everyone was already talking about, there would have been no need for Luke to name him and bring him into it. <br>
Luke only tries to put distance from the idea that Paul had physically ushered Trophimus into the temple by saying they only "supposed” it. <br>
The Jews of Asia knew that Paul was responsible for Trophimus defiling the temple. Some of them, having seen Trophimus and Paul together in the city would have naturally jumped to the conclusion that Paul had actually accompanied Trophimus into the temple. Thus the rumor began. Luke seized upon the error and tried to cover for Paul by saying, “they supposed that Paul had brought” Trophimus into the temple.  But the Asian Jews were none the less correct in accusing Paul of being responsible for Trophimus defiling the temple.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <strong class="text-strong">Second: Paul was responsible for Trophimus being in the temple</strong><br>
<br>
That Trophimus was an Ephesian and a friend of Paul is not in question. How Trophimus came to believe he had some right to enter the temple on his own accord is what tells the rest of the story. It could hardly be more obvious where Trophimus got his presumptuous idea in light of what we know Paul had been teaching the Ephesians. In his epistle to the Ephesians Paul had written these words: <br>
“Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh--who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands--that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens form the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been made near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of division 1 between us, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in himself one new man form the two, thus making peace, and that he might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. And he came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. Now, Therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 2 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom the whole building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.”  <br>
Ephesians 2:11-22<br>
<br>
1 "the middle wall of division" is a direct reference to the wall in the temple that separated the court of the Gentiles from the court of Israel. <br>
2 "members of the household of God" is an indisputable reference to those who have the right to worship in the temple.  <br>
<br>
Thus Trophimus boldly went where no Gentile was supposed to go! When he was caught and interrogated, his immediate defense would naturally have been along the lines of:<br>
<br>
“…but Paul said there is no difference between Jew and Gentile anymore!  He said the wall of division in the temple is meaningless.  He said I now have access to the Father and am a fellow citizen and an equal member with you in the household of God!” <br>
Now try to imagine how that defense would have gone over with the priests!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">This scenario would perfectly explain several things: </strong><br>
<br>
It explains why Paul was held responsible for a Gentile being in the temple ...even though he may not have physically ushered him in. <br>
It explains the subsequent uproar in all of Jerusalem against Paul. <br>
It also perfectly explains why James never did come to Paul’s rescue after this. <br>
<br>
Prior to this, James had confronted Paul concerning the anti-Moses rumors that were going around about him and effectively made it known to Paul that they had better not be true. James was the one who had sent Paul to the temple in the first place, for the very purpose of giving him opportunity to prove that the rumors were not true and that he continued to abide by the Law. (see Acts 21:18-25) James could have easily calmed the crowd by explaining everything and assuring the people that Paul had not brought a Gentile into the temple if that were the case and it was all a simple misunderstanding. But that wasn't the case. After Trophimus defiled the temple and tried to defend himself with Paul's doctrine, it was all over for Paul. The Jews from Asia testified that Paul had indeed been teaching such things, and quite possibly documented the fact with a copy of Paul's letter to the Ephesians. After this, James could not defend Paul any longer. There was no question anymore.  The rumors were true. Paul had in fact been teaching  “…against the people, the Law, and this place…”! </div></blockquote></div>

<strong class="text-strong">Open Letter to the Apostle Paul from a Concerned Reader</strong><br>
<a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2015/04/open-letter-to-the-apostle-paul-from-a-concerned-reader/" class="postlink">https://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns ... ed-reader/</a> - <a href="https://archive.is/gG3BE" class="postlink">https://archive.is/gG3BE</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dear Paul,<br>
<br>
First of all, thank you for writing so much of the New Testament.<br>
 <br>
Thank you for also teaching inerrancy, not only of the Bible you have (the Old Testament) but of your own letters and those other parts of the New Testament that hadn’t even been written yet!<br>
<br>
The actual reason for my letter is to ask you to clear up some confusion for me. I’m reading through Romans, and I see that you quote the Old Testament on pretty much every page.<br>
<br>
[Which, by the way, is another thing I appreciate that about your work: you show that the entire Bible is exactly on the same page, that the Old Testament writers were already writing about the coming of Jesus. And you quote chapter and verse to prove it.]<br>
 <br>
But, getting to my question–and if this is a minor point or I’m missing something, please feel free to ignore–I’m having some trouble with a few places where you quote the Old Testament.<br>
<br>
Now, I know you believe, as we all do, that the Bible, being God’s word, is perfectly consistent all the way through, meaning it doesn’t mean one thing in the Old Testament and another thing when you quote it. You respect the Bible and the intention of the original author more than anyone, and you’d never mistreat the Bible like that.<br>
<br>
But I’m reading along, a little more than halfway through (we call it Romans 9:25-26), where you are making your point about how God has called a people not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles.<br>
<br>
Then you quote from Hosea 2:23 and 1:10 to show that this whole business of including the Gentiles was on God’s mind all along.<br>
<br>
- Those who are not my people I will call “my people,” and her who was not beloved I will call “beloved.”<br>
<br>
- And in the very place where it was said to them, “you are not my people,” there they shall be called children of the living God.<br>
<br>
It looks like you’re saying “those who are not my people…not beloved” are the Gentiles who are now included because of Jesus. I’m happy for Gentile inclusion, being one myself, but I went back and read Hosea and I’m confused.<br>
<br>
It seems pretty clear to me that the original meaning and intention of Hosea is that God is restoring disobedient Israel after a period of rejection and punishment. I’m not seeing anything there at all about Gentiles, and so I’m not sure why you would say “here are two verses about Gentile inclusion.”<br>
<br>
I have some Christian friends who think that, because you’re Jewish, you might actually be engaging in a little creative Jewish midrash here, but I’ve told them that you would never play fast and loose with scripture! You understand that the very doctrine of inerrancy that you teach–maybe even the gospel that you preach–hangs in the balance.<br>
<br>
I think you see my confusion, though.<br>
<br>
So I’m asking you to help me defend you better. Perhaps point me to other places in your letters where you don’t do this sort of thing, which would really help in balance things out.<br>
<br>
Or maybe slowly and clearly explain how your use of Hosea’s words is aligned with what God actually intended, and why it’s OK for God to intend something Hosea doesn’t when it’s not OK for us to do that.<br>
<br>
I have to say, too, this lingering uneasy feeling has been growing since I began Romans. Please help me see better what I know you’re actually doing.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Your Fellow Soldier<br>
<br>
P.S. If you have some time, could you also clear up why you’re not a strong supporter of the “eternal covenant” of circumcision God gave Abraham and why all of a sudden the list of clean and unclean foods God gave Moses on Mt. Sinai is optional. Only if you have time.</div></blockquote>

6. Josephus refers to a “Saulus” who persecuted people in Jerusalem.<br>
7. Paul identifies his Herodian kinfolk.<br>
The fact that Saul/Paul was a Pharisee does not disqualify him from being a Herodian. Rather, it substantiates it.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paul, Saint, the Apostle , a Freemason<br>
<br>
In the Transactions of the Lodge Quatuor Coronati Volume I, page 74) there is a translation by Brother G. W. Speth of a paper by Brother Carl Herman Tendler, a member of the United Lodges, zu den drei Schwertern und Astrea zur grunenden Raute, im Dresden (at the Three Swords and Astrea, and at the blossoming Twig at Dresden). This Brother claims that, "There are many not unimportant grounds of suspicion that Paul was a member of the builder society at Damascus, and a master thereof, perhaps even a Chairmaster." His argument is principally Leased upon certain Significant words found in the writings of Saint Paul. For instance, the following statement is a fair example of his line of thought: The virtue which the builder-societies impressed upon their members as the most edifying the most conducive to edification, and which Saint Paul recommends to Christian builders as the dower and crown of humanity, the highest aspiration of Christian builder-societies, is agape, love, union in love. In his epistle to the Corinthians, amongst whom Saint Paul worked and taught eighteen months, the word is repeated twenty-three times. Most remarkable is the distinction (I Corinthians viii 1) between gnosis, wisdom of the mysteries, and agape, Christian union. "Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth, ' i.e., the speculations of the mysteries induce pride, but the Christian union produces amelioration.<br>
<br>
The original meaning of agape is not love, charity, but union, unity: thus asapai (usually translated love feasts are originally unions for Christian edification, mutual culture associations. The constant use of all these words points to the supposition that Saint Paul was a member of a builder-society, Mason Lodge. In this sense the fraternity of Masons is thus as old as mankind itself, and the most energetic and active apostle of Christianity was a Mason. The agreement of the principles of Freemasonry with those of Christianity can only be denied by the malevolent or those totally unacquainted with the Craft.</div></blockquote>

This would be me. Malevolent, and unacquainted with the craft of freemasonry. I like it this way.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Syriac Clementine Recognitions and Homilies is the first ever complete translation into a modern language of this important historical document relating to the origins of Judaism and Christianity. Found within the pages of the world’s oldest-dated manuscript, in any language, The Syriac Clementine Recognitions and Homilies tells the first-century story of a young Roman philosopher, Clement. Leaving his native land, Clement travels to the Middle East to meet the Apostles and records details of the original teachings of Jesus’ earliest followers. Clement also relays the travels of the Apostle Peter in his attempt to stop a false version of Christianity from being spread throughout the Roman Empire by an insidious deceiver. The narrative concludes with an amazing life story retold by the author. This astonishing document, having been suppressed for nearly two millennia, contains revelations about the formative years leading up to the split between Jews and Christians, and has the potential to revolutionize modern understandings of religion and philosophy. The text is written in Syriac, a dialect of the Aramaic language spoken by Jesus and his Apostles. The Clementine Recognitions and Homilies has previously only been available through altered Greek and Latin recensions and has become a topic of great controversy among Biblical scholars for the past five centuries. Now, for the first time, the oldest form of the text is made accessible to the public in a complete English translation. GEBHARDT, JOSEPH GLEN (2014).

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Ten Words</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1. "You shall have no other gods before Me." (Exodus 20:3)<br>
<br>
2. "You shall not make for yourself an idol." (Exodus 20:4)<br>
<br>
3. "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain." (Exodus 20:7)<br>
<br>
4. "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy." (Exodus 20:8)<br>
<br>
5. "Honor your father and mother." (Exodus 20:12)<br>
<br>
6. "You shall not murder." (Exodus 20:13)<br>
<br>
7. "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)<br>
<br>
8. "You shall not steal." (Exodus 20:15)<br>
<br>
9. "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor." (Exodus 20:16)<br>
<br>
10. "You shall not covet." (Exodus 20:17)</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Exodus 20:6</div></blockquote>
This is where all the Grace is.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. Deuteronomy 6:5</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">The Greatest Commandment</strong>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>29 Jesus replied, “This is the most important: ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One. <br>
30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ <br>
31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these."<br>
Berean Standard Bible Mark 12:29-31</div></blockquote>

Here’s some of Paul’s trickery.  He says the law is summed up in one command, love your neighbor.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Galatians 5:14</div></blockquote>

What about our Father? He couldn't even quote Jesus correctly. Didn't even know about Deuteronomy. What was he doing when he was supposed to be in synagogue, learning how to be a Pharisee? Maybe he skipped class to go to the temple of apollo, for a pulled long pork sandwich.<br>
<br>
An Israelite follower of Jesus would already know about these commands. And all others.<br>
<br>
All the lost sheep he sent his disciples to, would know them.<br>
<br>
So would any foreigner/gentile/stranger, living in Judea at that time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Gentile converts</span><br>
<br>
In Rome, Greece, Asia and elsewhere, #6, #7(women only), #8, and #9, were death penalty crimes. Law abiding gentiles would already be obeying these commandments. <br>
(women 4/10+, men 3/10+ obedient to God's Laws.)<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>#1  "You shall have no other gods before Me."</div></blockquote>

This is the conversion. Hearing the words of our Savior. The first step, believe. <br>
(women 5/10+, men 4/10+ obedient to Commandments)<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>#4  "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy."</div></blockquote>

Believers met on Shabbat/Sat. Joining the congregation. Hearing the Law of God.<br>
(women 6/10+, men 5/10+ obedient to the Law)<br>
<br>
#2 #3 #5 #10 are left, and #7 for the men.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">James' ruling at Jerusalem Council</strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood" (Acts 15:20).</div></blockquote>

This covers the most important dietary laws. And now the men have access to being equal to the women, if they start thinking with the right head.<br>
(6/10+ obedience of all believers)<br>
<br>
Food Laws, unclean = toxic. <br>
<br>
Yah doesn't want you to die, because of something you ate. He also doesn't want his people around those infested with worms and parasites. All from something they ate.<br>
<br>
Why? Worms and parasites cause insanity, disease and death. Most of the toxic animals are the ones who eat Humans. Bears, Cats, Crab, Dogs, Eagles, Eels, Hawks, Lobster, Pigs, Piranha, Shrimp, Vultures, Worms, they're carnivorous and can catch diseases from meat.  The nontoxic animals are herbivores. It's really simple, just don't eat anything that could/would eat you.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.” (Acts 15:21)</div></blockquote>

This is where the gentiles learn how to obey #2, #3, #5, #10, and #7 for the men. And the rest of the Morality Laws. <br>
(10+/10+ obedience)<br>
<br>
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Paul lied about the council at Jerusalem.</span><br>
<br>
He said all he was supposed to do is "remember the poor"<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>They only asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do. Galatians 2:10</div></blockquote>

 'eager to fleece the poor', is prolly more accurate.<br>
<br>
This puts any Gentile convert listening to Paul at, 6/10+ obedience for women, 5/10+ for men.<br>
Listen to his Sabbath rules. 5/10+ for women, 4/10+ for men. Never hearing the Law.<br>
Paul says lying is okay. 4/10+ women, 3/10+ men are obedient to God.<br>
Paul says idols are nothing and he puts Jesus above the Father. <br>
Looks like he gets rid of the 1st three commandments which deal with how to love God.<br>
3/10+ women, 2/10+ men are obedient.<br>
Dismal numbers.<br>
<br>
This also means that Paul's churches were riddled with worms, parasites, diseases and Demons. <br>
Just like all his churches are today. Yuk!<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Little Old Ladies: Did he just say NOT to obey God's Law? Who let that False Prophet in? That man doesn't speak the same words that Messiah taught us. Can you believe the garbage coming out of his mouth? What an horrible manlet. He just said, " I'm Christ's Apostle!" What a liar. Where's my slingshot?!?<br>
<br>
Saul of Tarsus: Shut those women's mouths!<br>
<br>
Thwap ..... Thump!<br>
<br>
Little Old Lady: I made soup &amp; sammies for everyone. Now, let's study the Word.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong">Saul never did anything praiseworthy.</strong></span><br>
<br>
Acts 21:17-26 KJV
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.<br>
18 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.<br>
19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</div></blockquote>

So to the jews he became a jew and told them exactly what they wanted to hear. But was he truthful? I wonder how many times he told them, <strong class="text-strong">"I'm Not Lying"</strong>?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</div></blockquote>

If what paul said was the truth then of course the Elders would have been praising God.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>21 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</div></blockquote>

If Paul was teaching this to Israelites, he was preventing the men from being able to enter the temple, teaching them to not obey the commandments. They wouldn't even be able to read from the scrolls kept in the local synagouges. The only writings they would be able to read are Paul's. See how that works well for apollo.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</div></blockquote>

Everyone in town is going to know you're here. If you want to get out of town alive, we advise you do this.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;<br>
24 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</div></blockquote>

This is where you get to put your money where your mouth is Paul. Prove to everyone that you keep the law.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>25 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.</div></blockquote>

Don't you remember, Paul? WE wrote to them, you lied to them.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.</div></blockquote>

How'd that work out for you, Paul? Paul???<br>
<br>
This was James sending Paul to the temple to prove he wasn't an apostate. Paul never finished this test. He failed. Trophimus defiled the Temple. Paul was arrested. Poor Trophimus!<br>
I wonder if he left those poor Nazoreans holding the bag (of hair)? Did he get to the part where he had to pony up the money for them, or did he get arrested before he paid?<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Who Should We Follow or Be Like?</strong>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Jesus says, "Follow Me." (Matt. 10:38)<br>
Paul says, "Imitate Me." (1 Cor. 4:16; Phil. 3:17)</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>If Paul did not walk or teach exactly like Jesus, and we follow Paul, where will that lead us?  Could Paul have walked or spoken exactly like the sinless one?</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>If Jesus is reaching out to you and asking you to "follow him", and then another voice comes along and says you ought to "imitate him", isn't that going to be very confusing?  How could you listen to both voices at the same time?  Could not those new believers who don't know the Master well yet, be easily mislead by another voice?  If that other voice is truly repeating Jesus' voice, then it won't contradict Jesus' Words in any way and it would point to Jesus only, right?</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paul sent a man named Epaphroditus back to the Philippians, after Epaphroditus had been very ill.  He instructs the brethren at Philippi to "hold such men in esteem", since he helped Paul when Paul was in need, and because "for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was<strong class="text-strong"> lacking in your service toward me</strong>." (Phil. 2:30).  Paul added a back-handed rebuke at the end of this, saying the brethren's service towards Paul was inadequate.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paul was quick to exhort others to honor and esteem those who esteemed Paul (Phil. 2:29).  What does Paul have to say about the three men whom Jesus chose, and who were closest to Jesus?</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"But from those who seemed to be something - whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows personal favoritism to no man - for those who seemed to be something added nothing to me", "and when James, Peter and John, who seemed to be pillars", "Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed", "and the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.  But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all" (Gal. 2:6, 9, 11, 13, 14)</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>These words are hardly words of honor and esteem for the three disciples closest to Jesus of Nazareth. </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The only reason that you won't read his words about his alleged atoning work plainly and literally - as Paul wrote them down - is because you are holding onto the lie of the doctrine of inspiration as proffered by the clergymen.  Or because you elevate Paul to a place he ought not to be elevated to, and thus are unwilling to face the truth about Paul - that he was a man who at times was full of pride and not faithful to all of Jesus' teachings.  I can promise the reader that if you will accede to this truth about Paul, you will be all the more free in Messiah Jesus!</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>If we receive these words of Messiah with child-like faith, He leaves no room for any one to be over us or leading us or teaching us - except himself.  John, one who was chosen by Jesus and was with him personally for about three years, says as much as well - if you need more than Messiah's own words - in 1 John 2:20, 27.  Wouldn't we be fools to place ourselves under any one's spiritual authority except The Master, the ONLY Worthy Teacher and Shepherd?</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paul both boasts and he boasts about his authority over them - of course he throws in the double-speak about the Lord giving him this authority for their good.  But Jesus says, "<strong class="text-strong">It shall not be so among you</strong>" regarding authority over one another, for He plainly says, "<strong class="text-strong">for you are all brothers</strong>".</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Who gave Paul this authority that he pounds the saints with?  Not Jesus, that is for sure, for Jesus teaches that he is the only authority, and our role is to encourage other's onto the narrow Way through example - through being the lowest servant of all - <strong class="text-strong">and those trying to be the lowest servants DO NOT exercise authority over anyone except themselves</strong>.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Instead of servant brothers following after their Master together as His Family, we now have all the titles and rulers and the resultant fiefdoms that make up christianity's religious system - in direct contradiction to Jesus' own Words!</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>If you look at the context of Titus 1, you will see that Paul is commanding other brethren to forcefully stop men who Paul deems as speaking lies and falsehoods contrary to the gospel ("whose mouth you must stop").  Was this Jesus' way?  Did Jesus teach his disciples to use force in stopping others from proclaiming things that contradicted or nullified his teachings?  No, he did not, and in fact Jesus taught that we ought to be kind and merciful even to our enemies.  Jesus plainly taught, "love your enemies".</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Before we look at Paul's gospel, there are two noteworthy observations.  First, Paul places a curse on all who don't believe his gospel.  Second, he does call it "his gospel" or "my gospel" on several occasions, as opposed Jesus' gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25; 2 Tim. 2:8).  Why wouldn't he call it Jesus' gospel or at least "the gospel"?</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Grace and faith as the whole of salvation with work's playing no contributing role.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This author would like to give Paul the benefit of the doubt and say that he was just confused a bit on Jesus' teachings about salvation.  However, Paul is very dogmatic about his teachings and he added a very important concept to Jesus' message on salvation...he introduced grace, <strong class="text-strong">which Jesus NEVER spoke about.  Jesus never uses the word "grace" even once in the context of salvation, and thus "grace" was NOT part of Jesus' good news regarding salvation.  This is an irrefutable fact.</strong> </div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">Conclusions:</strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paul had a very high view of himself and his works, and he clearly spent much of his time and energy promoting himself and arguing why he should be elevated above the brethren as what he considered the highest position with the most power the new faith offered - an "apostle".  <strong class="text-strong">Is it any wonder then that the error in his writings serve as the model for the clergymen who have followed in his footsteps</strong>?</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The fact is that his sinful words are used to justify the powerbase of the clergy.  I remember using his sinful words to justify my sinful words and ambitions in the past.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sadly, Paul's words nullify two of the most important beliefs that Jesus teaches.  First, he offers a different way to heaven than what Jesus taught and lived - grace instead of faith and obedience.  Second, he nullifies Jesus' teachings on his (Jesus) being the only spiritual leader that his followers are to have.  Paul teaches all kinds of intermediaries between men and Jesus - apostles (especially himself), prophets, pastors, teachers, elders, deacons, ministers, etc. ad nausea.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>According to Jesus, we ought to follow Jesus alone, and no other man.  Let us see Paul for what he was and not turn a blind eye to his faults.  Let us lose our lives for the Son of God, and continue pressing forward in the faith and looking to forsake all this world has to offer.  Let us love back the One who loved us and gave his life for us that we might Live forever with him and His glorious Father!  Let us get our eyes off of Paul, and onto the only One who is worthy of our deepest affections, and which One can grant us life eternal.</div></blockquote></div>

<strong class="text-strong">Paul in the Dead Sea Scrolls?</strong><br>
<br>
In the 3 years between Paul's conversion and his trip to Jerusalem, he admits to having little or no tutoring by the apostles (Galatians is the earliest of the two tales).<br>
In the Dead Sea Scrolls, Q40266, ‘The Damascus Document’, written around the time of Saul’s trip to Arabia (Essene site of Qumran is there). It’s an excommunication document condemning an unidentified man; referred to as the <strong class="text-strong">"Lying Adversary, the Lying Spouter, the Tongue, the Scoffer" who rejected the law in the midst of the whole congregation</strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">God tells us where "WILDERNESS" is....DAMASCUS.</strong>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1 Kings 19:15 NKJV<br>
Then the LORD said to him: "Go, return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, anoint Hazael as king over Syria.</div></blockquote>

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Greed </strong><br>
If Saul was really a tent maker, then it makes sense that he wouldn't want sacrifices to end, in any temple. Where would he get the skins for his tents if all temples went out of business? How high would the price of skins increase?<br>
<br>
He had no regard for animals. He used Gods rules for humane treatment of oxen, to tell people that God didn't care about those animals. God only cared that paul and his robber-disciples got paid money for what they did.<br>
<br>
Paul's gospel is tailor made to be applied to all pagan religions. Keep all your pagan and antichrist practices/works. Just believe that Jesus is messiah, no other works needed. Keep your evil practices.<br>

Why wasn't Paul able to quote scripture (OT) accurately?<br>
Did he ever quote Jesus? Once, maybe?<br>
Why did Paul need to add/subtract the Law? <br>
Why do Paul apologists have to do cartwheels through the scriptures trying to prove Paul wasn't a two faced liar?<br>

Abusers. Adulterers. Traffickers of children. Traffickers of terrorists. <br>
Pedophiles.<br>
<br>
Go back to Apollo, we don't need you. NOBODY needs you.</div>
