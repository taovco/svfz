			<div class="content">July 2020<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">It’s been less than thirty years since Rothblatt authored that first document to create a legal fiction of disembodiment and just over ten years since he wrote about re-conceptualzing our species boundaries. We are now facing the normalization of that disembodiment in the emerging industry of “gender identity.” </em></div></blockquote>

<a href="https://uncommongroundmedia.com/martine-rothblatt-a-founding-father-of-the-transgender-empire/" class="postlink">https://uncommongroundmedia.com/martine ... er-empire/</a>#<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Martine Rothblatt is an entrepreneur and lawyer who has been instrumental in the rise of transsexualism, transgenderism and ultimately transhumanism.<br>
At the heart of the emerging “Gender Identity” industry is a man in a dress, donning women’s breasts with the confidence only a man could acquire after a lifetime of being a first class citizen. Martine Rothblatt, born in 1954 is an exceedingly accomplished entrepreneur and lawyer. As the founder of United Theraputics, he was the top earning CEO in the biopharmaceutical industry. He identifies as a transsexual and transhumanist and has written extensively on the connections between the two. Rothblatt believes that human sexual dimorphism is tantamount to South African apartheid and that transgenderism is an onramp to transhumanism – which is for him an exercise in overcoming “fleshism.”<br><br>
As a member of the International Conference on Transgender Law and Employment Policy (ICTLEP) since 1992, Rothblatt authored the first draft of the Transexual and Transgender Health Law Reports, after meeting Phyllis Frye, another transsexual lawyer, in Texas. This small meeting of men with a penchant for wearing women’s undergarments was the launch pad for an international project to drive transsexualism globally and deconstruct human sexual dimorphism. The document Rothblatt drafted would later be referred to as the International Bill of Gender Rights (IBGR). Phyllis Frye has been referred to as the “grandmother of the transgender movement.” Though Rothblatt’s transhumanist preoccupations may garner him more attention, we must consider him as much of an influence in normalizing transsexualism (transgenderism before it was rebranded), as Frye, if not more. A history of their meeting and subsequent growth of the transgender project in the culture, can be found here.<br><br>
The Conference of Transexual and Transgender Law and Employment Policy became an international project once Frye was contacted by a transsexual identifying female in the UK named Stephen Whittle, now a professor of equalities law at Manchester Metropolitan University and president-elect of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) which has since developed an American branch (USPATH). Whittle too has been extremely instrumental in driving trans activism, especially in the UK. She became part of the human rights experts team, who elaborated on the international human rights guidelines, the Yogyakarta Principles at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia in November 2006. The meeting added SOGI (Sexual Orientation Gender Identity) principles to the YP, known as Plus 10. Used as international legal guidelines, they are not actually law but are being treated as such by LGBT NGOs fronting for the medical industrial complex, with an investment in future medical-tech identities. The “Gender experts” are self-manufactured professions, much like the mythology of “gender identity” itself.<br><br>
The Transexual and Transgender Health Law Reports initiated by Frye and Rothblatt and then Whittle, became a working draft for another global document and committee outlining transsexual/transgender rights in the UK, the Interdepartmental Working Group on Transexual People, advanced by yet another male, transsexual, lawyer, Christine Burns and set up by the Home Secretary of the UK in 1999. Membership at the Working group included representatives from Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the US.<br><br>
These four lawyers, all transsexual identifying, have been the main generators of a project to deconstruct sex within the law, on a global scale and to have it replaced with medical identities representing how people feel about their bodies. Martine Rothblatt has gone much further in this deconstruction process.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Quest for Trans-be-manism<br><br>
Within a few years of the Conference on Transgender Law and Employment Policy (ICTLEP) driven by Rothblatt, Frye, Whittle, and Burns, Rothblatt studied for a PhD in medical ethics in London. He was granted a PhD in 2001, based on his dissertation on the conflict between private and public interest in xenotransplantation – any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation or infusion into a human recipient of live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source. He later created a pig farm to harvest organs, in hopes of eventual use in humans. His purpose is everlasting life for humanity by continual replacement of organs as they wear out.<br><br>
Rothblatt is a tenacious and accomplished individual. He’s worked in Washington, DC in the field of communications satellite law. He has worked for NASA, was the CEO of GeoStar and the co-creator of SiriusXM Satellite Radio <br><br>
He also led the International Bar Association’s biopolitical (an intersectional field between human biology and politics) project to develop a draft of Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998). He has written extensively on the need to overhaul our system of labelling people as either male or female based only on their genitalia, digital immortality and the future of creating humans, new reproductive technology, genetic screening and DNA-mapping.<br><br>
Rothbaltt not only believes we can live indefinitely, but after meeting Ray Kurzweil of Google and being enamored with Kurzweil’s Singularity theory, created a religious organization, Teresem Movement to promote the geoethical (world ethical) use of nanotechnology for human life extension. Teresam conducts educational programs and supports scientific research and development in the areas of cryogenics, biotechnology, and cyber consciousness. He has worked in partnership with Kurzweil promoting a screen adaptation of The Singularity Is Near.<br><br>
Rothblatt appeared with his wife Bina, and their daughter, Jenesis on the View, in 2016, interviewed by Whoopi Goldberg (note of interest: Goldberg is the host of a trans reality TV modeling show). There was a fourth member of the family available for interviewing as well. Bina48 is a robot created by Rothblatt who is a replica of his wife both inside and out. It is Rothblatt’s intention to install Bina’s consciousness into his robot and eventually distill it to digital data to live in cyber space indefinitely.  He fully believes robots are people without skin – hence the transcendence from “fleshism.”<br><br>
Rothblatt authored a peer reviewed essay in 2008, published for the Institute of Ethics and Emerging Technologies, entitled, “Are We Transbemans Yet?” while he was still the head of United Therapeutics. The essay speculates about reinventing our species and coins a new term called beme.  He wrote: <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The bottom line of this essay is that in an Information Age society the “beme is mightier than the gene.” This means that transmissible units of character or existence are more important than genetic information. For example, most people’s love-mate is a person with whom they share no genetic commonality outside of that which is in the general gene pool of their community.  However, a lasting interpersonal relationship is only possible if the two partners share a strong appreciation for each other’s bemes – their characters, natures, and ideational units of existence. <br><br>
To say the “beme is mightier than the gene” is to disagree with the socio-cultural implication of “blood is thicker than water.” Most people’s strongest relationship, that with their spouse, or with a best friend, is not a blood relationship. On the other hand, bemes are not like mere water. A person builds up his or her bemes over time and evolves them as appears most conducive to an enjoyable life. More apropos than “blood is thicker than water” is “minds are deeper than matter.”  <br><br>
“This essay aims to open our eyes to the fact that because our society is now based upon bemes more than genes it must logically re-conceptualize its species boundary.”</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div>
