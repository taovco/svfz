Such a decline is a nine-sigma event, meaning that it is so unlikely to occur by chance, that it would naturally happen as rarely as an asteroid striking the Earth.</strong><br><br><br>
My article explored several more locales (UK, North Dakota, and Switzerland).<br><br>
But no other place stands out as much as Taiwan does.<br><br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">23% Drop in Birth Rate in Taiwan<br></span><br><br>
According to a Taiwan government report, the birth rate dropped by 23.24% in May 2022, compared to May 2021.<br><br><br><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc880bedf-4285-4609-a7d0-a0e123299dbc_1255x946.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br>
I inputted historical birth rate data from Macrotrends for the years 2009-2021, and added the year 2022 as year 2021 adjusted down by 23.24%. Obviously, 2022 is not over and the number of Taiwanese babies to be born this year (or during the next 12 months) is unknown. So the chart below is an illustration of what would happen in the next 12 months if the 23.24% drop stays constant.<br><br><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb4fd116-ed0d-43e2-b10b-64551ab1383a_605x442.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><br><br><strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">When expressed in “sigmas”, units of standard deviation, the 23.24% drop in the birth rate in Taiwan is a 26-sigma event!</span></strong> <br><br><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99615b03-46cb-440a-9621-b0c472901821_463x87.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><br><strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">This is can be described as “unimaginable” in terms of the likelihood of happening due to random chance.<br><br>

Except a 26-sigma drop in birth rate just happened in Taiwan.</span></strong><br><br><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F386c280a-da76-4a39-8f19-4d7c686415ef_1125x1485.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">What Happened In Taiwan?</span><br><br><br>
Health experts are quick to blame Covid for all sorts of health problems afflicting those they advised to vaccinate. It is not the vaccine, they say, it is Covid. We tried to protect you with the vaccine, they would always insist. But you got Covid anyway, thanks to the evil antivaxxers, and your problems are due to Covid — that’s their explanation.<br><br>
We know for certain, though, that the drop in birth rate in Taiwan is NOT due to Covid. Yes, Taiwan is suffering from a terrible COVID pandemic right now (despite being 91% vaccinated), however, Covid in Taiwan only started around April 21 of 2022, and could not impact May birth rates much.<br><br><br><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f980737-9125-4760-904d-22abcef9d56e_1076x705.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br>
To see what could cause the extreme drop in births, go back 9 months from May 2022, so to September 2021.<br><br>
Taiwan was a poster child for successful vaccination. 91% of all Taiwanese residents received a vaccine dose. By October 1, 2021, 56% of ALL people of Taiwan received Covid vaccines.<br><br><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ad42b0-84b9-4bb9-814a-c2fc2b396baf_826x615.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><br>
They got a fairly usual mix of “safe and effective” AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Pfizer vaccines. <br><br><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59c6762f-24ab-4d85-ba29-d3d86c182c02_314x602.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><br>
People of Taiwan got their shots, felt assured that Covid-19 stops with every vaccinated person, and moved on with their lives.<br><br>
I doubt that the people of Taiwan noticed anything at the end of September. They knew for sure that their vaccines were safe and effective and would not affect their sperm or pregnancies. So they proceeded with family plans just as before, trying to make babies on purpose, or partying and having fun and getting pregnant accidentally, just as people do elsewhere.<br><br>
Except for 9 months later, they only gave birth to 77% of the number of babies expected.<br><br>
I hope that the people of Taiwan will start asking their authorities: what is happening to us?<br><br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">A Glimmer of Hope</span><br><br>
If you are like me, and you like babies, children, and grandchildren, you are probably upset by now and are wondering what will happen to all of us. Let me mention a possibility that, although unlikely in my opinion, may make this drop in birth rates temporary.<br><br>
Covid vaccines are known to “disrupt the menstrual cycle” and lower sperm counts. It is possible that some women, for a period of several months, could not conceive and become pregnant due to these disruptions. Because all Taiwanese women were vaccinated at almost the same time, those disruptions created a precipitous drop in birth rates.<br><br>
My hope, as someone who likes people, is that this will turn out to be the case. However, in my opinion, we will likely see the opposite, and reductions in birth rates will be permanent. Why? Because vaccinating young people was a crime. It was not a mistake. Let me not explain why, in this article. <br><br>
Crimes like this are NOT perpetrated to achieve a two-month drop in birth rates. Criminals of such nature who gave young people shots that they did not need, for sinister reasons, go for the jugular. Of course, not all people participating in vaccination campaigns were having such sinister intentions. But it is possible that some persons on top had criminal motives that they did not disclose.<br><br>
Again, I hope that the preceding paragraph will turn out to be unfounded. I was, and am, against any of that happening, do not support anything that is happening in Taiwan, and I am very worried.<br><br>
Time will tell. <br><br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">They Told Us it is Safe</span><br><br>
This fact check from Dec 5, 2020 says that the vaccine is definitely safe for pregnancy “because there is no evidence that it is unsafe”. No trial specifically for pregnancy and fertility was conducted. They just lied to us that it is safe — but had no way of knowing.<br><br><br><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b18e02d-dace-460a-99b9-16457fe1e5ff_1600x1000.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote></div>
