Eight Italians have been arrested and 490 warned that they are under investigation, in a scandal that has shocked and outraged the country. Police are reportedly trying to identify 5,000 people who are suspected of attempting to purchase the videos, some of which appear to contain images of children being tortured and murdered.<br><br><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">The tapes, which were made in Russia, have allegedly generated revenues of £410m for their makers.</span></strong><br><br>
The directors of two state-run television news programmes resigned yesterday after brief excerpts of the paedophile videos were broadcast on Wednesday to illustrate reports. The images were apparently taken from internet sites promoting the pornographic films, which cost anything from £270 to £4,000.<br><br>
Gad Lerner, the respected director of the main RAI One news programme, interrupted his broadcast to apologise to viewers for the "ignoble" and "violent" images that had been shown only minutes earlier.<br><br>
Mr Lerner and his RAI Tre counterpart, Nino Rizzo Nervo, admitted that they did not know what was going to be on the reports.<br><br>
Italian investigators have identified three Russians who are suspected of being at the heart of the traffic in violent films, which are promoted over the internet and distributed on video cassettes, CDs and DVDs.<br><br>
One of them, Dimitri Ivanov, has reportedly been in prison since September 1999, charged with violence against minors and the distribution of pornographic material. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">The other two, Dimitri Kuznetsov and Andrei Minaev, are said to have benefited from an amnesty passed by the Russian parliament.</span></strong><br><br>
The investigation began two years ago following a denunciation by a parish priest from the Sicilian town of Avola, who runs a helpline for abused children. He found evidence of the traffic on the internet.<br><br>
Italian police identified the internet site that promoted the videos and intercepted 3,000 cassettes before they reached purchasers in Italy.<br><br>

The investigators named the Russian firms involved in the trade as Tim-O-Seev Video and Flower 2. Many of the tapes were duplicated and delivered to buyers by police who posed as postmen. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Those arrested include businessmen and public employees.</span></strong><br><br>
Exposure to the images has been a traumatic experience for police and magistrates. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Alfredo Ormanni, the prosecutor in Torre Annunziata, near Naples, who is coordinating the inquiry, said they induced such a sense of desperation that he had been tempted to abandon his profession.</span></strong><br><br>
"For some time it has been possible to buy the sound files of rapes and every time that we discover one and report it to the police the screams of those children remain in my brain for days, and I blame myself for not being able to save them," said Father Fortunato Di Noto, whose denunciation began the investigation.<br><br><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Investigators said they believed that the victims shown in the films were kidnapped from orphanages in Russia and the Middle East.</span></strong> Some are said to have been snatched from their parents during visits to the circus.</div></blockquote>

Britain is a key link in the biggest ever international investigation into the production and supply of paedophile 'snuff' movies - in which children are murdered on film - an Observer investigation can reveal.<br><br>
The key suspect in the inquiry, a Russian who was arrested last week in Moscow for distribution of thousands of sadistic child porn videos and pictures, was traced following the seizure of his products from British paedophiles.<br><br><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Dmitri Vladimirovich Kuznetsov, a 30-year-old former car mechanic in Moscow, was identified after British Customs and police traced the origin of violent child porn videos found in the UK back to Russia.</span></strong><br><br>
Last week <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Italian police seized 3,000 of Kuznetsov's videos on their way to clients in Italy, sparking an international hunt for paedophiles who have bought his products.</span></strong> The Italian investigators say the material includes footage of children dying during abuse. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prosecutors in Naples are considering charging those who have bought the videos with complicity in murder.</span></strong> They say some may have specifically requested films of killings.<br><br>
British authorities yesterday confirmed that scores of Kuznetsov's videos, produced in his small flat in Moscow's rundown Vykhino district, have been found in the UK. They are concerned that 'snuff' movies in which children are killed may have also been imported.<br><br>
Around a dozen British men have already been arrested and charged with offences alleged to be connected to the Russian tapes. A second Russian child porn ring, which allegedly had a British distributor, was broken up earlier this year. The investigation into the importing of violent Russian child porn which led to the identification and subsequent imprisonment of Kuznetsov started about 15 months ago after Customs seized material coming into the country. Since then there have been dozens of other finds.<br><br>
'We have seen some very, very nasty stuff involving sadistic abuse of very young children, but actual deaths on film takes it a whole step further. That is very worrying,' said one senior customs officer this weekend.<br><br>
British paedophiles were paying between £50 and £100 for Kuznetsov's tapes, the officer said. Further fees were paid for access to a website that features pictures of extremely violent abuse.<br><br>
Though two men arrested with Kuznetsov have also been imprisoned by Moscow authorities, only one of the three remains behind bars. Dmitri Ivanov was sentenced to 11 years for actually participating in the abuse that was being filmed. The others were released under an amnesty aimed at clearing Russia's overcrowded prisons.<br><br>

When officers from the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department raided Kuznetsov's flat they found two boys in a makeshift studio. They seized a huge quantity of films and other pornographic material as well as <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">lists of clients in Italy, Germany, America and Britain.</span></strong><br><br>
Last week Italian detectives moved in, following months of inquiries, and arrested eight people. The police searched more than 600 homes and say they now have evidence against about 500 people. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Among the suspects were businessmen, public employees and a university student. Several of them were married, with children of their own. Hundreds of people are also under investigation in Germany.</span></strong><br><br>
The Russian videos, which had been ordered over the internet, were intercepted when they came into Italy by post, repackaged and then delivered by undercover police officers. They cost between £300 and £4,000, depending on what type of film was ordered.<br><br>
Covert film of young children naked or undressing was known as a 'SNIPE' video. The most appalling category was code-named 'Necros Pedo' in which children were raped and tortured until they died.<br><br>
Police in Russia and the UK believe that Kuznetsov and his associates have been in business for more than two years in which time they are believed to have recruited around 100 boys - aged between nine and 15 - to be filmed.<br><br>
'Most of the children were rounded up from railway stations. A lot of them came from the suburbs, or surrounding regions and were from deprived, problem families,' said Kiril Mazurin, a police spokesman.<br><br>
'Usually when children like this arrive in the capital, they've got no idea where to go and hang around in the station. It's very easy to entice this kind of teenager - with a promise of a warm bed or a trip to the cinema.'<br><br>
Many were lured away from orphanages. 'Children are not locked in,' said Mazurin. 'Anyone can come along and promise them a meal at McDonalds. It doesn't take any more than that."<br><br>
Some children were paid a commission to find other boys willing to be filmed, according to reports in the Russian press, for a fee of between 100 and 300 roubles (£2.50 - £7).<br><br>
Kuznetsov had given up his job in 1998 to devote himself to the lucrative pornography industry. A self-taught computer expert, he was in the process of upgrading his equipment to allow him to e-mail videos directly to clients when police raided him.<br><br>
Many customers repeatedly ordered videos from him. The Naples newspaper Il Mattino published a transcript of an alleged email exchange between a prospective client and the Russian vendors.<br><br>
'Promise me you're not ripping me off,' says the Italian.<br><br>
'Relax, I can assure you this one really dies,' the Russian responds.<br><br>
'The last time I paid and I didn't get what I wanted.'<br><br>
'What do you want?'<br><br>
'To see them die.'</div></blockquote>

** Interesting coincidence: this is the same Torre Annuziata prosecutor whose office in 2000 brought out information on a Russian-centered pedophile snuff ring, a scandal that was completely covered up – a fact that Ormani complained about. The office also showed up in the CIA-Cosa Nostra-Vatican-tied Roger D’Onofrio affair. Torre Annunziata is a small city with 45,000 inhabitants at the foot of Mount Vesuvius. In essence it’s a suburb of Naples. ISGP suspects these scandals might be linked and part of what was described by Belgian officials as “la Nebuleuse”.<br><br>

- “In stark contrast to the lacking visual evidence, victim-witnesses not only have been testifying about violent abuse and -trafficking networks for a long time, they also mentioned very specific and similar details, including the torturing and killing of children, sometimes in front of cameras. These reports really got off the ground in the United States in 1987, followed a few years later by Great Britain. Since the Dutroux case exploded, we also know that similar testimonies have come from Belgium and surrounding countries. As we shall see, Russia followed <br>
in 2000.<br>
…<br>
Other evidence of snuff movies had surfaced several weeks before the article above was published. In September 2000, the Italian media broke the story of a Russian child abuse network -centered in Murmansk and Moscow- which besides regular child pornography and hardcore SM, also shot snuff movies, selling them <br>
for at least 4,000 pounds per video. The children were recruited through familiar tactics: they were lured away from the street or orphanages with empty promises, while a small number was kidnapped. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Most clients, among them businessmen and government officials, came from Italy and Germany; others came from France, Britain, America and Japan. Several "large financial companies" were tied to the network, but names weren't given.</span></strong> [73: September 28, 2000, Aftonbladet <br>

reports:<br><br><em class="text-italics">“Last week Italian police seized 3,000 of Kuznetsov's videos on their way to clients in Italy, sparking an international hunt for paedophiles who have bought his products. The Italian investigators say the material includes footage of children dying during abuse... "The Russian videos, which had been ordered over the internet, were intercepted when they came into Italy by post, repackaged and then delivered by undercover police officers. They cost between Pounds 300 and Pounds 4,000, depending on what type of film was ordered."Covert film of young children naked or undressing was known as a 'SNIPE' video. The most appalling category was code-named 'Necros Pedo' in which children were raped and tortured until they died. "The Naples newspaper Il Mattino published a transcript of an alleged email exchange between a prospective client and the Russian vendors. 'Promise me you're not ripping me off,' says the Italian. 'Relax, I can <br>
assure you this one really dies,' the Russian responds. 'The last time I paid and I didn't get what I wanted.' 'What do you want?' 'To see them die.'”</em> [74: October 1, 2000, The Observer, 'Special Investigation: British link to 'snuff ' videos']<br><br>
A Swedish newspaper added: <br><br><em class="text-italics">"The pictures are unbearable for normal people to watch. Here are prolonged rape sequences with children begging to be spared. They are <br>
abused until they faint. Then they are murdered in front of the cameras... Yes, there are even scenes of actual autopsies on young people... In the 'product catalog' of the pedophiles were pictures of a 10 year old girl who had been killed by hanging. A five year old girl with a grimace of pain as she is raped.

Featured Image text: Andrei Minaev, one of the three main suspects of having ran the Russian ring. By the time the affair hit the news, his two partners had already been released from prison due to a recently-launched amnesty program for inmates. The picture is an excerpt of one of the confiscated videos.Even though this news is hugely important, there have been only a handful of newspaper reports about this whole affair. In Italy, some of the most passionate reporters were quickly done away with after they had shown a number of abuse images in a late night television program.

The broadcast, seen by more than 7 million people, stunned the country.

it's hard to imagine actual uncensored snu ff or hard rape extracts were aired.] In contrast to the US media, which appears to have been completely silent on the subject [77: I have not been able to find any news reports while going through the archives of many hundreds of US newspapers, including the New York Times and Washington Post. At the very least, the Russian pedophile and snuff ring has been severely underreported in the US.], several British newspapers brie fly wrote about the affair. But even in Italy the whole matter vanished from the public eye within one or two weeks with no follow up reports having been published since. So as usual, those who want answers are left with numerous questions: Have the hundreds of suspects against whom evidence was found been prosecuted? What happened to the thousands of others who were still under investigation? Was this network tied to other networks? What happened to the videos? Can snuff movies still be considered a myth?<br><br>

- “Is there such a thing as a new P2? That's hard to say.

More important maybe, these networks have always been criminal and it is more than likely that these associations remained. And the CIA would also most likely continue the association to run all kinds of operations through.<br><br>
In case of Italy, as late as 1996 Licio Gelli's name came up in a new scandal described as "Death, drugs and diamonds in tale of global conspiracy." The facts that were being uncovered sounded a lot like a continuation of the P2 and P7 <br>
network and maybe even more so of the closely related <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">"Nebuleuse"</span></strong> network, which has been described in detail by ISGP.

It seems like a scoop of epic proportions, but not a whole lot of important additional information could be found about the affair. It reminds one of a scandal in 2000 in which it was reported that a Russian-centered pedophile ring was exporting the most horrendous snuff videos to wealthy Italian clients. As could be expected, leading politicians and businessmen immediately covered up the scandal by firing journalists willing to bring out the raw evidence. [14: *) Beyond Dutroux; *) October 1, 2000, Associated Press, 'Director Quits Over Child Porn': <br><br><em class="text-italics">"The news director of Italian state television's primary station resigned Sunday, taking the blame for allowing graphic images of child pornography to air in a prime-time report.

The Russian media, in fact, never <br>
even bothered to mention it. <br><br>
Strangely, these seemingly separate scandals were both brought to the world by Torre Annunziata prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni [15: *) June 3, 1996, The <br>

Alfredo Ormanni, the prosecutor in Torre Annunziata, near Naples, who is coordinating the inquiry, said they induced such a sense of desperation that he had been tempted to abandon his profession."]</em>, who certainly about the 2000 case was complaining of a cover up. The thing is, Torre Annunziata is a small city with 45,000 inhabitants at the foot of Mount Vesuvius. In essence it's a suburb of Naples. What are the chances that a <br>
prosecutor from this small city stands at the basis of these two enormous leaks? One can't help but wonder to what extent these scandals are linked. And looking at ISGP's articles as <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Beyond the Dutroux Affair</span></strong> and especially <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">La Nebuleuse</span></strong>, there's a very good chance that these scandals might well be tied together somehow. Then again, beginning in 2002 Ormanni ended up in legal trouble himself over allegedly questionable investigative practices, so who knows, maybe he was actually corrupt or crazy. But what about those seemingly very real snuff films? Excerpts were broadcasted on television. <br><br>
This actually reminds me of something else. There's a possibility that Licio Gelli has been involved at a high level in the extremely unknown and very esoteric Memphis Misraim freemasonry rite, along with the very questionable House of Savoy. This is also discussed in ISGP's <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Beyond the Dutroux Affair</span></strong>, going back to 2007. <br><br>
At the very least we can say that there are strong indications that a lot is going on behind the scenes in Italy which we know nothing about. And if Licio Gelli continues to be involved in these kind of behind-the-scenes criminal activities, then what does that say about old associates as Andreotti or Valori? As the following article makes clear, in 2009 it was Valori's turn to resurface in a new criminal investigation. Unfortunately, much less information leaked out compared to 1996 and 2000.”<br>

It was the police in Torre Annunziata, south of Naples, who led the reconnaissance in cooperation with the police in Moscow. 8 of those arrested yesterday are Italians while one is a Russian citizen. Of the Italians, an official of the medical service, is married without children. <br>
Another is an entrepreneur and a third civil servant in Milan. Irreprocilable citizens whom no one could suspect.<br>
The scandal completely dominated Thursday's newspapers and television broadcasts, this after broadcasts of child pornography images were broadcast on prime-time television.<br>
The opposition immediately demanded the resignation of state broadcaster Rai's leadership, an issue that was brought up for debate in the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday. "What has happened is absolutely inexcusable," said opposition leader and media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, whose television stations chose not to show the images, according to TT-Reuters. The newspaper La Repubblica devoted three pages to the tangle that has international ramifications.In an editorial, competitor Corriere della Serra wrote that the scale of the tangle is frightening."We could never have imagined that thousands of well-off people, in the midst of society and even cultured, find pleasure in seeing children tortured and killed." Naples Police's Special Unit for Internet-Related Crimes said about 600 homes were searched in dawn raids Wednesday. According to police, the key people are three Russians who kidnapped children from orphanages, amusement parks and parks. Subsequently, the children were filmed as they were subjected to aggravated sexual abuse. <br><br><strong class="text-strong">Catalogue of paedophiles</strong> <br><br>
In the paedophiles' "catalogue of goods" there were pictures of a girl in her 10s who had been killed naked by hanging. A five-year-old girl with a cry of pain across her face while being raped. An adult person killed by piling. The worst images went by the label "necros pedo" and showed children killed during the beating. Such cassettes conditioned 2000 dollars.The arrested persons had specifically asked for assurances that the children were indeed killed and that it was not a case of photomontage or trick photography. Italian police had put over 500 websites under control. It identified the senders and intercepted the material as it passed the Italian post. There it was copied, and then proceeded to the recipient. But then it was a policeman with a hidden camera who handed over the package.Police seized broadcasts including video and DVD films. The packages were resealed and delivered by police officers disguised as postmen, who also surreptitiously filmed the recipients. The price for the packages was stated to be between 3700 and 55000 SEK, a rising scale depending on the extent of the abuse.1700 people are on the list of the suspects while 490 have been notified that they will be prosecuted for crimes.<br><br>

-<br><strong class="text-strong">One of those who tracked pedophiles in the tangle in Italy is the law student Nanni Arena.Aftonbladet has met the hacker who became an expert and is now hired by prosecutors and police around Italy.</strong><br><br>
Nanni Arena is located in Catania, Sicily. Officially, he is a law student but he is 30 years old and still has nine degrees left before he can leave the university.His studies are going badly through the nights, navigating the police's mission on the internet and looking for new pedophile sites. Like the one he's recently been involved in tracking.<br><br>
- It is wrong to think that the Italian part consists only of individual pedophiles who were customers of the Russians. More I can't say because much of the investigation is still classified," he said.<br><br>
He is also one of the founders of the Catholic humanitarian organization Telefono Arcobaleno -Telefon Regnbågen. That organization receives children's depictions of abuse of them. It was when a rainbow employee presented his evidence to prosecutors in Torre Annunziata, south of Naples, that the investigation into this pedophile spree began just over 18 months ago.<br><br>
"... this kid dies for real"<br>
- We have found no ramifications to Sweden or Scandinavia this time. The customers of this Russian organization were mostly in Italy but also in France, Germany, the USA and Japan. And <br>
then all of Eastern Europe," says Nanni Arena.Small snippets of the chat dialogue between buyers and sellers have been made public:<br><em class="text-italics">- Can you swear you are not deceiving me.<br>
- Absolutely, I assure you that this kid he dies for real.<br>
- But the last time when I paid, the item didn't match what I expected...<br>
- What do you really want?<br>
- That they really die, that you can see how they die...<br>
- Rest assured - this one he's dying for sure...</em><br>
The prosecutor of Torre Annunziata, Paolo Fortuna, says:<br>
"It is so disgusting that one would rather quit this job. But then you think of all these little children who are tormented in this way.<br>
"My worst shock is when I start recognizing children from one movie to the other. I see that they have grown older and that you continue to torment them.<br>
- And I myself can't do anything to help them. I don't know where they are or who kidnapped <br>
them," says Nanni Arena.<br>
The children in question either come from Russian orphanages for orphans. The children are kidnapped, often with the caregivers' knowledge. Other children are caught up in parks or even during circus performances while their parents for some moment lose sight of them.<br><br>

Author Philip Willan (in Rome)<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Paedophile videos stun Italians</strong><br><br>
Italian police have discovered a massive international paedophile network selling violent child pornography videos to clients in Italy, the US and Germany.<br><br>
Eight Italians have been arrested and 490 warned that they are under investigation, in a scandal that has shocked and outraged the country. Police are reportedly trying to identify 5,000 people who are suspected of attempting to purchase the videos, some of which appear to contain images of children being tortured and murdered.<br><br>
The tapes, which were made in Russia, have allegedly generated revenues of £410m for their makers.<br><br>
The directors of two state-run television news programmes resigned yesterday after brief excerpts of the paedophile videos were broadcast on Wednesday to illustrate reports. The images were apparently taken from internet sites promoting the pornographic films, which cost anything from £270 to £4,000.<br><br>
Gad Lerner, the respected director of the main RAI One news programme, interrupted his broadcast to apologise to viewers for the "ignoble" and "violent" images that had been shown only minutes earlier.<br><br>
Mr Lerner and his RAI Tre counterpart, Nino Rizzo Nervo, admitted that they did not know what was going to be on the reports.<br><br>
Italian investigators have identified three Russians who are suspected of being at the heart of the traffic in violent films, which are promoted over the internet and distributed on video cassettes, CDs and DVDs.<br><br>
One of them, Dimitri Ivanov, has reportedly been in prison since September 1999, charged with violence against minors and the distribution of pornographic material. The other two, Dimitri Kuznetsov and Andrei Minaev, are said to have benefited from an amnesty passed by the Russian parliament. <br><br>
The investigation began two years ago following a denunciation by a parish priest from the Sicilian town of Avola, who runs a helpline for abused children. He found evidence of the traffic on the internet. <br><br>
Italian police identified the internet site that promoted the videos and intercepted 3,000 cassettes before they reached purchasers in Italy.<br><br>
The investigators named the Russian firms involved in the trade as Tim-O-Seev Video and Flower 2. Many of the tapes were duplicated and delivered to buyers by police who posed as postmen. Those arrested include businessmen and public employees.<br><br>
Exposure to the images has been a traumatic experience for police and magistrates. Alfredo Ormanni, the prosecutor in Torre Annunziata, near Naples, who is coordinating the inquiry, said they induced such a sense of desperation that he had been tempted to abandon his profession.<br><br>
"For some time it has been possible to buy the sound files of rapes and every time that we discover one and report it to the police the screams of those children remain in my brain for days, and I blame myself for not being able to save them," said Father Fortunato Di Noto, whose denunciation began the investigation.<br><br>
Investigators said they believed that the victims shown in the films were kidnapped from orphanages in Russia and the Middle East. Some are said to have been snatched from their parents during visits to the circus.<br><br>
• September 29, 2000, Clarin, ‘A network of Russian and Italian pedophiles discovered on the Internet’; <br><a href="https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/descubren-internet-red-pedofilos-rusositalianos_0_HJg-zateRFg.html" class="postlink">https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/descubr ... teRFg.html</a><br><br>
An investigation initiated in Italy revealed a traffic of photos and videos showing the murder of boys The children were taken from Russian orphanages For these videos were paid up to $ <br>
17,000 <br><br>
The dark side of the Internet is a site where photos and videos of abused and murdered boys in front of the camera lens are sold at a high price and in dollars. It is called "necropedophilia" and is the last telematic frontier of the sexual perversions of those who surf the net.<br><br>
This is revealed by an investigation by the Procuración de Torre Annunziata, Italy, which <br>
discovered a gigantic pedophile network between Russia and Italy that trafficked in photos and assettes played by minors. Footage of sex, violence and death that paid up to $17,000. The headquarters of the organization was in Russia, but the branches of the business were scattered all over the world. For the investigation, 11 arrests were made. But, beyond the numbers, an atrocious issue that is still being investigated is revived: the homicide of minors.<br><br>
"Tragic overturn"<br><br>
Prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni is convinced that he is "facing a tragic turnaround in reality, with children raped, abused and murdered in front of the camera. It seemed implausible, but two years <br>
of investigations lead us to this terrible situation.<br><br>
"The investigation began in 1998, when a Russian site that disseminated pornographic images of boys was identified, with a tariff and a wide possibility of choice. Investigators contacted the Russians, viewed their catalog and went so far as to intercept thousands of customers and confiscate 600 cassettes and photos. They also discovered that among the netizens who acquired the materials were several minors.The head of the organization, and owner of the site, is Dimitri Victor Kuzentov, with whom Andrea Valeri Minaev, former Soviet military officer, owner of a video distribution company and responsible for the "sector under 5 to 12 years old", and Dimitri Valeri Ivanov worked. Requests for international arrest were filed against them on charges of prostitution of minors and production and marketing of paedopornographic materials. Its "industry," within two years, received payments of billions of dollars through an international fund transfer company. The names of the eight Italian members of the organization remain secret.<br><br>
Regarding the investigation, Attorney General Ormanni is particularly severe: "Pedophilia is like the mafia and the underworld, but we are not yet prepared to fight it.<br><br>
"In today's Russia, so fragile, so exposed to the instigations of wealth, children are more fragile and more exposed to the insidiousness of unscrupulous exploiters. If the rich West pays in dollars for its perverse pleasures, in transitional Russia, without laws or rules, pornography is produced for pedophiles, research sources said.<br><br>
So it is not difficult to find material for pedophiles in this kind of paradise of contravention that are the Moscow electronics markets, at least according to Western patterns.<br><br>
It is enough to approach the right person to find all kinds of video pornography. But the real traffic boom came from the hand of the Internet. And, while official statistics from the Russian Interior Ministry say that pedophilia is a declining phenomenon, Boris Altsciuler, chairman of the Commission for the Defense of Children's Rights, says that "these figures can be misleading. We are not at the level of Thailand, but we have thousands of reasons to worry. The inefficiency and corruption of the state apparatuses make it impossible to address the phenomenon closely. Adequate legislation is lacking. Meanwhile, minors do not perceive themselves as victims of criminality and, therefore, do not report," he explains.<br><br>
Supply is also nourished, in many cases, by war. Scenes filmed in the middle of the guerrillas, revenge, death squads that look like stories, soldiers of some army that end up in some mass grave. But, although the poverty and political vacuum of the Eastern countries are a mine of resources, as the research that led to the discovery of the Russian-based organization shows, the business was basically fueled by the abduction and abuse of minors. In Russia there are four million abandoned children who should consider themselves lucky when they end up in a miserable orphanage and not on the street. The organization kidnapped them from these orphanages to use them as victims of sacrifices in front of the camera lens.</div></blockquote><script data-cfasync="false" src="https://searchvoat.co/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script></div>

Author, Beatriz Iraburu, Colpisa<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Eight arrested in Italy and 1,700 suspects for their alleged relationship with the gang,which sold the images Three Russian officials of a child pornography network and eight of their Italian clients were arrested yesterday in their respective countries in the course of a vast police operation. Italian law enforcement carried out 600 searches in thirteen peninsular regions and found an authentic "catalogue of horrors", with real videos and photos of child abuse and murder. Its sale, according to the researchers, brought the band revenues of more than one hundred billion pesetas in recent years.</strong><br><br>
“This is one of those times that make you want to leave the profession and close your eyes so as not to suffer," exclaimed Alfredo Ormanni, a magistrate who examined fragments of the thousands of cassettes bought by pedophiles. In some, creatures are seen raped and tormented to death. According to the magistrate, there have been cases of Italian customers demanding by email from Russian suppliers guarantees that the agony of the small victims was real and not the result of a set-up. The eight Italians arrested _dos officials, an industrialist, a builder, two merchants, a photographer and a student universitario_ are reportedly among those who appreciated violence against children. Among them are two minors. In addition, another 1,700 people are being investigated for their alleged connection to this case. Of these, 490 are already subject to judicial proceedings, since they allegedly bought images ranging from filming carried out in the changing rooms of children's clothing stores to unspeakable abuse. This material takes on a high price, according to the police, as it is guaranteed that the images have not been tricked, with victims between two months and twelve years old. Prices range from the 80,000 pesetas that were requested for a daring photo and more than a million pesetas for a video with the most rugged scenes. Researchers suspect that some of the creatures used by Russian thugs were kidnapped or bought from Orphanages in Eastern Europe, or abducted on the street. Italian police had been alerted by a founded children's aid association, the Rainbow Phone, which, in the last four years, reported the existence of 24,000 paedophile sites on the Internet. The priest Fortunato di Noto, president of this body, said that "he does not want to criminalize the Internet", but that greater attention is needed to these pages, which only in Italy have 150,000 regulars. The Italian researchers, who had the collaboration of their Muscovite colleagues, managed to follow the traces of many shipments. Intercepted at the border, the videos were duplicated by the telecommunications police and then handed over to their Italian recipients by guards disguised as postmen. The investigation, which began 19 months ago, remains open. Judicial sources estimate that the interrogations will last more than a month. Italian Social Affairs Minister Livia Turco called the operation "a great success" while declaring herself "impressed by the level of ferocity that some people demonstrate against children."<br><br>

Five journalists resigned on Thursday<br><br>
EFE<br><br>
ROME .- At the moment, the broadcast of videos of pedophiles with children in the RAI has not made heads roll. The board of directors of the Italian public broadcaster has decided not to accept the resignation presented by the directors of the information services.<br><br>
The heads of the station have confirmed in their positions the head of news of the RAI-1, Gad Lerner, and that of the RAI-3, Nino Rizzo Nervo, with three votes in favor and the contrary opinion of the two councilors of the conservative opposition, who have left the meeting in protest.<br><br>
The president of the RAI, Roberto Zaccaria, has acknowledged that the issuance of the gruesome images, provided by the police, was "a serious error", which "does not correspond to our usual way of understanding and doing the information", as published today by the press.<br><br>
The heads of public television will, however, open a file against those responsible and various editors of the news, but have insisted that the information about the network that produced pedophile videos was "attentive and pluralistic".<br><br>

“By Bruce Jonhston in Milan, 30 September 2000 – 12:00am<br><br>
A PAEDOPHILE scandal has rocked Italy, prompting impassioned debates in parliament, after state television broadcast footage of child pornography on the country's main evening news programmes.<br><br>
Eight Italians have been arrested after a two-year inquiry in Naples into a Russian-controlled internet ring that sold paedophile videos of children made in Russian orphanages. The news footage shown by Rai as Italians were sitting down to dinner on Wednesday sickened and angered viewers, including Giuliano Amato, the Prime Minister.<br><br>
Gad Lerner, a Left-wing journalist who was recently named director of the main Rai-1 news, quickly went on air to apologise to viewers for showing the footage. He said it was the result of a move by "insensitive" staff, against his orders to treat the story with delicacy. He had been angered "as a journalist and a father" when he saw the images, he added.<br><br>
Both he and Nino Rizzo Nervo, the head of the Left-leaning Rai-3 news, which broadcast the same clip an hour earlier, resigned. They were hastily reinstated by the corporation's directorgeneral, who sought to defuse the row by saying that the video had been given to Rai by the investigators.<br><br>
Alfredo Ormanni, the chief prosecutor in Torre Annunziata, near Naples, who has been handling the inquiry into the internet ring, denied this. He suggested that the broadcast of the material might have been arranged to confuse the issue and protect the identity of someone involved who was high up in Italian public life.<br><br>
The centre-Right opposition has been quick to seize on the handling of the case by Rai, which is influenced by the centre-Left. Piersilvio Berlusconi, the son of the opposition leader and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, said yesterday that his family's television empire would not have dreamt of broadcasting such a video. The Rightist National Alliance called for the entire senior management of Rai to resign.”<br><br>
• October 1, 2000, The Observer, 'Special Investigation: British link to 'snuff ' videos'; <br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/01/ameliagentleman.philipwillan" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct ... ilipwillan</a><br>
Britain is a key link in the biggest ever international investigation into the production and supply of paedophile 'snuff' movies - in which children are murdered on film - an Observer investigation can reveal.<br><br>
The key suspect in the inquiry, a Russian who was arrested last week in Moscow for distribution of thousands of sadistic child porn videos and pictures, was traced following the seizure of his products from British paedophiles.<br><br>
Dmitri Vladimirovich Kuznetsov, a 30-year-old former car mechanic in Moscow, was identified after British Customs and police traced the origin of violent child porn videos found in the UK back to Russia.<br><br>
Last week Italian police seized 3,000 of Kuznetsov's videos on their way to clients in Italy, sparking an international hunt for paedophiles who have bought his products. The Italian investigators say the material includes footage of children dying during abuse. Prosecutors in Naples are considering charging those who have bought the videos with complicity in murder. They say some may have specifically requested films of killings.<br><br>
British authorities yesterday confirmed that scores of Kuznetsov's videos, produced in his small flat in Moscow's rundown Vykhino district, have been found in the UK. They are concerned that 'snuff' movies in which children are killed may have also been imported.<br><br>
Around a dozen British men have already been arrested and charged with offences alleged to be connected to the Russian tapes. A second Russian child porn ring, which allegedly had a British distributor, was broken up earlier this year. The investigation into the importing of violent Russian child porn which led to the identification and subsequent imprisonment of Kuznetsov started about 15 months ago after Customs seized material coming into the country. Since then there have been dozens of other finds.<br><br>
'We have seen some very, very nasty stuff involving sadistic abuse of very young children, but actual deaths on film takes it a whole step further. That is very worrying,' said one senior customs officer this weekend.<br><br>
British paedophiles were paying between £50 and £100 for Kuznetsov's tapes, the officer said. Further fees were paid for access to a website that features pictures of extremely violent abuse.<br><br>
Though two men arrested with Kuznetsov have also been imprisoned by Moscow authorities, only one of the three remains behind bars. Dmitri Ivanov was sentenced to 11 years for actually participating in the abuse that was being filmed. The others were released under an amnesty aimed at clearing Russia's overcrowded prisons.<br><br>
When officers from the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department raided Kuznetsov's flat they found two boys in a makeshift studio. They seized a huge quantity of films and other pornographic material as well as lists of clients in Italy, Germany, America and Britain.<br><br>
Last week Italian detectives moved in, following months of inquiries, and arrested eight people. The police searched more than 600 homes and say they now have evidence against about 500 people. Among the suspects were businessmen, public employees and a university student. Several of them were married, with children of their own. Hundreds of people are also under investigation in Germany.<br><br>
The Russian videos, which had been ordered over the internet, were intercepted when they came into Italy by post, repackaged and then delivered by undercover police officers. They cost between £300 and £4,000, depending on what type of film was ordered.<br><br>
Covert film of young children naked or undressing was known as a 'SNIPE' video. The most appalling category was code-named 'Necros Pedo' in which children were raped and tortured until they died.<br><br>
Police in Russia and the UK believe that Kuznetsov and his associates have been in business for more than two years in which time they are believed to have recruited around 100 boys - aged between nine and 15 - to be filmed.<br><br>
'Most of the children were rounded up from railway stations. A lot of them came from the suburbs, or surrounding regions and were from deprived, problem families,' said Kiril Mazurin, a police spokesman.<br><br>
'Usually when children like this arrive in the capital, they've got no idea where to go and hang around in the station. It's very easy to entice this kind of teenager - with a promise of a warm bed or a trip to the cinema.<br><br>
'Many were lured away from orphanages. 'Children are not locked in,' said Mazurin. 'Anyone can come along and promise them a meal at McDonalds. It doesn't take any more than that.<br><br>
"Some children were paid a commission to find other boys willing to be filmed, according to reports in the Russian press, for a fee of between 100 and 300 roubles (£2.50 - £7).<br><br>
Kuznetsov had given up his job in 1998 to devote himself to the lucrative pornography industry. A self-taught computer expert, he was in the process of upgrading his equipment to allow him to e-mail videos directly to clients when police raided him.<br><br>
Many customers repeatedly ordered videos from him. The Naples newspaper Il Mattino published a transcript of an alleged email exchange between a prospective client and the Russian vendors.<br>
'Promise me you're not ripping me off,' says the Italian.<br>
'Relax, I can assure you this one really dies,' the Russian responds.<br>
'The last time I paid and I didn't get what I wanted.'<br>
'What do you want?'<br>
'To see them die.'<br><br>

ROME (AP) _ The news director of Italian state television’s primary station resigned Sunday, taking the blame for allowing graphic images of child pornography to air in a prime-time report.The broadcast, seen by more than 7 million people, stunned the country. In the ensuing uproar, RAI-TV came under attack from the Vatican, the Parliament, the president, the prime minister, politicians on both the left and the right, family and child advocates and a host other news organizations.Gad Lerner, who had been at the helm of RAI-Uno just three months, tendered his resignation on Thursday, the day after the broadcast. But the governing board of RAI-TV refused to accept it.Despite that vote of confidence, Lerner, a veteran journalist many had hoped would inject new life into state TV’s news operation, said Sunday he was quitting.RAI-Uno announced his decision at the beginning of the prime-time news Sunday.Lerner, who has admitted he didn’t even know what would be on the news the night of the broadcast, said that he was leaving because he had failed to supervise what was on the show.He also said it wasn’t fair that only lower-ranking RAI employees had paid for the mistake with their jobs.Lerner’s counterpart at another RAI channel, Tre, had also offered to resign but the RAI board allowed him, like Lerner, to stay on.An anchorman and two assistant news directors lost their jobs over the Wednesday night broadcasts. Both RAI-Uno and RAI-Tre used similarly graphic footage of naked children and a video clip of a man apparently having sex with a little girl.<br><br>
It was part of a report on the arrest of 11 people allegedly involved in a Russian-run child porn ring that sold its wares through a graphic online catalogue. Its offerings reportedly included ``snuff″ films of children being murdered.<br><br>

A prime time news broadcast of child pornography has stunned Italy, triggered political uproar and exposed cronyism in the state-owned RAI television network.Graphic images of children being tortured and apparently murdered were followed within minutes by an apology which in turn led to resignations and allegations of rampant corruption.Interrupting programmes to make an emotional late night broadcast, Gad Lerner accepted responsibility for the fiasco and quit as news director of RAI's first channel.Shaking with anger, he attempted to scalp a political opponent in the process. Mr Lerner claimed the chairman of the parliamentary commission on the media, Mario Landolfi, had pressured him during lunch."When coffee came, he took out a scrap of paper and told me: 'There's this person to fix up, if possible.'"Confirming widespread suspicions that RAI's three state-owned channels were riddled with patronage, the scandal has catapulted media ownership back on to the agenda in the run-up to the general election.The centre-left government backed Mr Lerner and demanded the resignation of Mr Landolfi, a member of the right-wing National Alliance opposition party.Mr Landolfi admitted he made the request but said it was legitimate since his friend was already employed by the channel. The opposition branded RAI a hotbed of government-appointed leftists who would say anything to destroy opponents.The affair broke last week when Russian and Italian police discovered an international paedophile network selling pornography videos to clients in Italy, American and Germany.That evening's news on RAI One and RAI Tre illustrated the story with images of a man apparently raping a boy to death. Another showed a man having sex with a little girl. Complaints jammed the switchboards within seconds.<br><br>
Aldo Grasso, one of Italy's most respected television critics, said the broadcasts were symptomatic of a plunge in standards. "Editors are driven not by quality or responsibility toward viewers but only the ratings."The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano blasted a cult of sensational images and said the broadcasts had violated Italian families in the guise of news. An anchorman and two assistant news directors immediately resigned and the government promised an inquiry. Days later Mr Lerner made his broadcast.Although he had not viewed the news clips in advance he took corporate responsibility and resigned. However he had been infuriated by "hypocritical" attacks from centre-right politicians who had lobbied him for jobs.Mr Landolfi was "the same person who in recent days has asked me resign in a gesture of freedom and consistency".An uneasy balance exists in Italian broadcasting. The centre-left effectively controls RAI and Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the centre-right coalition, owns the three Mediaset channels. Should Mr Berlusconi win the next election, as polls indicate, he will in theory be able to control RAI as well.Upon its election in 1996 the centre-left vowed to reform the system and make RAI meritocratic, if not independent. That never happened and whoever wins office effectively wins the network.That tantalising prospect was what fuelled the opposition's attacks on Mr Lerner, claimed the government. Accusing each other of being thuggish and disgusting, the row is set to simmer until the election which is due by April 2001. Mr Lerner has been replaced by Albino Longhi, who has been head of the channel twice before.<br><br>

ROME, Italy -- An Italian prosecutor has charged almost 1,500 Italian and foreign nationals in connection with a investigation into child pornography on the Internet.In the inquiry -- which could lead to one of the biggest trials in Italy -- prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni has ordered 831 Italians to stand trial.He has also called for 660 foreigners to be tracked down and sent to Italy to answer the charges.The child pornography case is focused around a paedophile ring based in Russia which was uncovered a month ago.It is believed extradition requests and international arrest warrants may be issued for those accused outside Italy, who are believed to be mainly in Russia, France and Malaysia.The huge number of people were trapped in a complex investigation which involved the authorities setting up a fake paedophile Internet website.The site, set up with the help of the world's biggest software company, Microsoft, was called "amantideibambini" ("loversofchildren").It registered 1,032 subscribers despite a number of clear warnings to make sure they wanted to enter it.A number of those charged, none of them Italian, have been accused of offering pornographic material over the Internet.The vast majority face charges of downloading child pornography.The charges were made exactly a month after the paedophile scandal erupted in Italy following a swoop on 600 homes in the country.Eight people were initially arrested in Italy on charges of possessing and trading in child pornography, all of it from Russia.Three people were at first believed to have been detained in Russia in connection with the paedophile ring but the reports were later found to be false.A police operation specialising in Internet crime and based near the port city of Naples reported that the Russian paedophile ring ran an operation to kidnap children from orphanages, circuses and public parks and film them while they were forced to commit sexual acts.In Italy, packages ordered on the Internet were intercepted when they arrived by mail and were repacked. They were then delivered to the addresses by undercover police officers disguised as postal workers and carrying hidden cameras.The material cost between $400 and $6,000 for each video or disc depending on the type of film the customer wanted -- the more horrific, the more costly.The service was divided into several categories. "SNIPE" was the term given by the ring for videos of children filmed nude without their knowledge."CP" was the code word for ordering an item from a paedophile's "private collection."The most gruesome, police said, was coded "Necros Pedo," in which children were raped and tortured to death.Italian prosecutor Ormanni told Italian news agency ANSA he believed those accused in Italy would cooperate with the court and may thereby avoid a jail sentence."But the important thing is to succeed in freeing at least one of the children who appear in those horrendous pictures," Ormanni said. "If we do succeed, we will have achieved a large part of our goal."<br><br>

An Italian prosecutor has charged 1,491 Italians and foreigners suspected of selling and buying child pornography online, media reported Saturday.Prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni charged 831 Italians and 660 foreigners with a wanted warrant issued. Most of the defendants live in Russia, the United States, France and Malaysia.At the heart of the case is a group discovered in Russia a month ago that was engaged in the distribution of child pornography.A large number of the defendants were trapped in a complex operation in which, among other things, a website called "amantideibambini" (children's lovers) was set up in international cooperation. It was able to identify 1.032 paedophilia enthusiasts who, despite harsh warnings, registered as users.<br><br>
Several individuals have also been charged with distributing porn over the Internet, while most are still facing charges for acquiring child pornography.A paedophilia scandal broke in Italy a month ago, when 600 houses were searched and eight people were arrested for selling Russian-made child pornography.A gang operating in Russia allegedly abducted children from orphanages, circuses and parks and later forced them to have intercourse.The videos, which cost between $400 and $6,000 (7,500-113,000 Estonian kroons), were sold online and were also ordered in Italy, depending on the degree of obscenity.Italian police confiscated the corresponding packages at post offices, repackaged the shipments and sent masked police officers wearing video cameras to deliver them.The criminals offered several kinds of films. The first part consisted of works in which naked children had been filmed without their knowledge.The second group includes simple pornographic works, while the third was called "Necros Pedo", and in these films children were raped and tortured to death.<br><br>

In cooperation with hundreds of computer experts, Italian police carried out a major operation to apprehend those distributing child pornography online, which is now expected to result in 1,500 paedophilia charges now being tried.Prosecutor Alfredo Ormann faces 831 Italians accused of distributing or consuming child pornography in a trial that promises to become one of the biggest ever in Italy. He also wants 660 foreigners brought to the same court.Most of the foreigners involved in the paedophilia scandal come from Russia, France and Malaysia. A month ago, the Italian police managed to uncover a criminal ring spreading child pornography.Although the group itself was based in Russia, they spread their products all over the world through the Internet. According to Italian police, this group of criminals kidnaps children from orphanages, circuses and parks and then forces them to take part in films later sold to paedophiles in different countries.Among the Russian productions there were films in which children were abused in many ways: raped, tortured and even killed. The youngest of the children shown in the film was still in diapers. The Russian, who is believed to be the leader of the group and whose arrest request was sent by Italian police via Interpol to his Russian counterparts, has previously been jailed for paedophilia. He was released under amnesty this spring.A large number of people were caught thanks to a fake paedophilia page that investigators posted online. Although the page contained clear warnings about its illegal content, 1,032 people registered there.There were 400 computer experts involved in the paedophile hunt, who had to monitor movements on certain servers 24 hours a day. In addition to the aforementioned decoy page, information technologists hacked into web pages offering child pornography and tried to corrupt them. Microsoft and the FBI helped carry out the operation.<br><br>

Or so it seems, and in Italy nothing is ever as it seems.Breezing through chat shows, offices and homes is the suspicion of a cover-up. Almost 1,500 people have been charged but not those in high places who are believed to form a "paedophile <br>
lobby".My neigbours, echoing last night's chat shows, are certain a conspiracy is afoot. Whispers and denunciations will continue awhile but probably come to nothing. Italy will have another mystery.The facts are these. Two years ago police, prodded by a campaigning Sicilian priest, set up a fake website to trap sellers and buyers of child porn.Self-styled "child-lovers" downloaded Russian-made films of seduction, rape and torture. Last week police charged 831 Italians and issued arrest warrants for 660 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.A victory for law-enforcement, trumpeted the government. Quite the contrary, said the magistrate leading the investigation, Alfredo Ormanni. Speaking into a forest of microphones, he claimed a network of politicians and institutional figures had obstructed the investigation and tried to protect the guilty."There is a paedophile lobby that acts in broad daylight and probably with the support, which I could consider unwitting, of certain political parties," said Mr Ormanni.Father Fortunato Di Noto, the priest who tipped off police, claimed ministers were refusing to act on evidence. He would explain himself only to President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi because he could not trust the government.The effect was electric. Paedophiles in power closing ranks to protect their own. Unbelievable. Except lots of people believe.The government has hit back, demanding that Mr Ormanni name names or shut up. The climate of suspicion was unacceptable, said interior minister Enzo Bianco.The story appears to have peaked and today is already melting into inside pages, for the thunderbolts are spent. Proof is unlikely to emerge, leaving a legacy of suspicion."There they go again, wriggling off the hook," said my grocer, Raffaele, echoing widespread fatalism, cynicism and belief in conspiracies.Another fact: Italian magistrates are often politicians-in-waiting. To make the leap requires a dash of publicity. Is Mr Ormanni such a man? Very possibly, but that doesn't deter belief in his claims.His listeners are suffused with memories of myriad, unexplained acts of violence which the state may have covered up or even committed. To name just two. In June 1980 a DC-9 plane crashed near the island of Ustica, killing 81 people. A bomb on board, a missile or an accident? No one knows. Documents disappeared, voice recordings were erased, officials lied.Last September eight military men, including four former generals, went on trial on charges of giving false testimony. In December 1969 a bomb ripped through a bank in Milan's Piazza Fontana, killing 16 and injuring 84. Right-wing terrorists, almost certainly, but in cahoots with security services?Possibly, since at that time a climate of fear was judged propitious to combat communism. But no one knows, despite seven trials. The eight started last March."It's an amazing story," said the writer Dario Fo. "The fascists, and even the state and branches of the secret police and paramilitary organisations and even the CIA were involved."The prime minister himself, Giuliano Amato, publicly hinted that the state needed to come clean.No area is above suspicion. This week eight professional footballers were found guilty of matchfixing. Doping claims swirl around Italy's Olympic medallists.<br><br>
Little wonder that Pope John Paul I and Diana, Princess of Wales, are widely believed to have been murdered. When politicians, generals, cardinals and sportsmen cannot be trusted, accepting their word strikes many as just plain dumb.<br><br>

For four weeks, Fortunato Di Noto and Alfredo Ormanni were the heroes of the nation: Di Noto, the head of the child protection association "Arcobaleno", had discovered the Russian connection of Internet child pornography, and prosecutor Ormanni from Torre Annunziata near Naples had managed to get involved in the networks and in the end initiate over 1700 criminal proceedings; including around 700 people abroad. Six Italians were arrested, and international arrest warrants were issued for three Russians. Never before had such a comprehensive break-in into the child market been achieved. In addition, the disappearance of several children from Italy could be solved on the basis of the pictures.But now, barely a month after the lightning action, the retreat came - according to a script that is fatally reminiscent of that of the child molester trials in Belgium. Shortly after the arrests, the enlightenment felt a headwind: All the detainees were immediately released by the courts. The main mastermind in Moscow, despite requests for administrative assistance from Italy apparently unmolested, offered his websites again under a different name. And Italy's politicians turned a deaf ear when chief investigator Ormanni lamented the legislative leniency towards pedophiles.At the end of last week, Di Noto announced that he would no longer cooperate with the courts. Prosecutor Ormanni showed understanding for this and spoke of a "veritable pedophile lobby", which also includes a number of politicians - although "perhaps only unconsciously". Since then, representatives of all parties have demanded that the chief investigator should "name names" or take his hat off - knowing full well that the prosecutor is not allowed to chat about an ongoing case. But that's exactly what Di Noto now wants to do - first to President Ciampi. He is now under pressure not to grant the man an audience. And the politicians are using the breathing space with the promise of all sorts of tightening of penalties. But that doesn't reassure anyone. Because there are already high threats of punishment. Anyone who possesses child can be sentenced to up to three years in prison, manufacturers of relevant cassettes or images up to 12 years. But the child molesters caught benefited from another law that promises high penalties if they are confessed. In the end, they only got 12 to 18 months. On probation.<br><br>

At the end of last week, on the charges of prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni (Alfredo Ormanni), an Italian court ruled to prosecute 1491 people (831 Italians and 660 foreign citizens) for distributing on the Internet and downloading child pornography (including with scenes of violence and murder), reports Yahoo! News.The story began a month ago, when Italian authorities released details of an investigation into child pornography distributed over the Internet. The investigation was conducted by the Forces of the Italian police, international intelligence agencies and Microsoft Corporation.According to official sources at the time, a huge number of people participated in the distribution of child pornography via the Internet, and it came from Russia. It turned out that in Russia there was a criminal group engaged in the filming of materials of this kind, and then sold them around the world through the Network. A month ago, 8 people were arrested in Italy in this case. It was also reported that three Russian organizers of this dirty business were arrested by the Russian authorities. Later it turned out that the message was incorrect - these people, the most important defendants, went unpunished.In order to estimate the number of people who can be accused of crimes against morality with acalm soul, it is enough to give one example. Only on one of the sites where the materials received from our country were posted, 1,032 subscribers were registered.Among the foreigners currently in the field of view of the Italian police are residents ofRussia, France and Malaysia. The court is now assessing the possibility of international arrests.<br><br>

His comments have seen Italy's fragmented political forces close ranks swiftly to demand that if the magistrate has evidence of an organised pro-porn lobby that he name names.Mr Ormanni last weekend charged 1,500 people, including 831 Italians, with selling or downloading internet child pornography. It was the culmination of a lengthy investigation by police, centring on a paedophile ring in Russia that operated a vast traffic via the internet. The gang allegedly kidnapped children from orphanages and parks and filmed them doing sexual acts against their will and then sold the footage for between £200 and £4,000 via the internet. Horrified investigators gathered images of more than 2,000 children who were filmed while being abused, raped and in one case killed."There is a paedophile lobby that acts in broad daylight and probably with the support, which I could consider unwitting, of certain political parties," said Mr Ormanni."If he has evidence of a crime we need names and surnames," responded interior minister Enzo Bianco in a television interview, saying he had created a "climate of suspicion that is frankly unacceptable".The Social Affairs Minister, Livia Turco, accused Mr Ormanni of electioneering, and defended Italy's child protection legislation. Opposition hard-right MP Alessandra Mussolini, who recently proposed bombarding child sex sites with viruses, said the allegations must be cleared up immediately.Mr Ormanni's comments, which recall the scandal that rocked Belgium, came shortly after one of Italy's most active anti-porn campaigners, Father Fortunato Di Noto, said he would not longer collaborate with the authorities because the phenomenon wasn't being taken seriously enough.Material provided by Fr Di Noto and his volunteers at Telefono Arcobaleno has been indispensable in the current inquiry and past convictions.Further heightening suspicion that the inquiry had touched insospettabili, figures above reproach, Fr Di Noto said he would explain his decision only in person to the Italian president.As part of the operation, a special police squad near Naples set up a fake paedophile website which attracted more than 1,000 subscribers, despite clear warnings about the content. Most of those indicted are charged with downloading child pornography.<br><br>

ROME, Nov. 2 -- The Italian interior minister scolded a magistrate Thursday for accusing politicians of obstructing an investigation into a massive worldwide child pornography ring.Interior Minister Enzo Bianco complained to the Rome daily La Repubblica that the magistrate, Alfredo Ormanni, had provoked a "horrible furor" with his allegations.Ormanni has accused politicians, whom he hasn't named, of working to prevent tougher sanctions for the consumers of child pornography."If he has evidence of a crime, we need names and surnames," Bianco said. "This man has created a climate of suspicion that is frankly unacceptable."The charges and counter-charges occur as Italian police say they are tracking down 831 Italian suspects among 1,500 people worldwide who they believe to be users of a Russian-based child pornography video ring.According to news reports, police have discovered a Russian-based paedophile ring takes orders over the Internet from users, and then dispatches video cassettes. The videos reportedly include scenes of rape, torture and even murder of minors.Ormanni went public just a few days ago confirming reports that he had identified more than 800 Italians involved -- mostly as consumers -- and saying his work was the culmination of a long investigation focusing on a paedophile ring based in Russia.Ormanni said a gang allegedly kidnapped children from orphanages and parks and filmed them doing sexual acts against their will and then sold the footage for between $500 and $6,000 on the Internet."There is a paedophile lobby that acts in broad daylight and probably with the support, which I could consider unwitting, of certain political parties," he said.<br><br>

Italian prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni issued 831 subpoenas to Italian pedophile citizens and demanded the involvement of another 660 pedophiles from France, Russia and the Philippines.The mass persecution of pedophiles in Italy began with a scandal with a Russian citizen living in Switzerland, Alexander Khailick (Kommersant wrote about this in June).Then, as is usually the case, in order to catch other pedophiles, the police created their own pedophile site called amantideibambini (lover of children), which was subscribed to by about a thousand people. In addition, the police carefully investigated the Internet for the possibility of sharing pornographic photos of children and came to the conclusion that Russians and Filipinos were to blame for everything, and Italians only downloaded child to their hard drives. Now the question arises: already at this stage of the investigation, the internal affairs authorities of the countries to which Prosecutor Ormanni pointed out must extradite the suspects to Italy or first conduct their own investigative actions?In the suburbs of Naples, called Torre Annunziata and where the prosecutor Ormanni serves, the process of persecuting pedophiles turns into a political scandal. To begin with, the prosecutor said that in Italy in general and in Naples in particular there is a powerful political and pedophile lobby that impedes the investigation of cases related to the sexual use of minors. At the same time, it was based on the statements of the priest Fortunato Di Noto ( Fortunato Di Noto), the creator of the so-called "Rainbow Telephone" - a trust service for children. But Di Noto's father said that, as always, everyone was lied to by journalists and he did not accuse the political leadership of Naples of anything.The Italian prosecutor has not yet waited for the response of the Russian authorities.<br><br>

Father Di Noto denounces the interests of mafia organizations<br>
ROME, Nov 3.- The "Rainbow Phone", an organization that collected complaints about abuses committed against children, has been forced to close when it receives extremely serious threats."Arco Iris" is a volunteer association that emerged in the Sicilian province of Syracuse on the initiative of the Italian priest, Father Fortunato di Noto. In its four years of life, it has given information to the Magistracy on twenty-nine thousand Internet sites around the world, dedicated to pederasty and child pornography.Thanks to the data offered by Father di Noto, it was possible to detect the network selling sadistic videos from Russia. The scandal of the videos led to the resignation of the director of the news of the first channel of the RAI (public television network) for having broadcast images of torture.During the last week, both the founder of the line, and the Neapolitan prosecutor responsible for the case, Alfredo Ormanni, had lamented the lack of support from the high politics of Rome due to the weight of the pederast "lobby" in the parties and parliament. Both were criticized for not making public the names of the high protectors of pederasty, but the very popular founder of the "Rainbow Phone" insisted that he would only expose the magnitude of the problem to the President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.Now, he has thrown in the towel and announced that the Rainbow Phone closes and will deactivate even the Internet site. The news has been given by the association in a statement in which it specifies that "it has ceased to exist because whoever had the strength to defend it has not done so. It's not a defeat or, at least, it's not our defeat."The threats may have come from the Russian mafia but, above all, from the Sicilian one since Di Noto claims that they have been forced to close "very refined minds", an expression used in his day by the murdered judge Giovanni Falcone.Father Noto appreciates the attitude that the bishop of his diocese, Monsignor Giuseppe Malandrino, had adopted so far with regard to the initiative: "From my bishop," says Father Fortunato, "I have received only encouragement and support."Although Father Di Noto did not want to go into details about the threats, the vice president of the volunteer association of "Arco Iris", Giovanni Arena, said a little more: they have come from "very refined minds of organized crime that has consolidated its presence in the multimilliondollar business of pederasty".<br><br>

Investigation against a prosecutor who had created a site to unmask them.Rome of our correspondentTrapped sites, access to certain censored webs, double agents on the Web: Italy goes to war against alleged pedophiles online. Last week, the prosecutor of Torre Annunziata, near Naples, Alfredo Ormanni, requested the referral to court of 831 Italian Internet users and launched dozens of letters rogatory against 660 foreigners, including in France, Switzerland and Malaysia. The magistrate suspects them of "possession and transfer of child pornography". To unmask the pedophiles, Magistrate Ormanni did not hesitate to set up a fake site intended to serve as bait. With the help of Microsoft, agents of the Italian financial brigade and investigators from the Torre Annunziata prosecutor's office have put online a site with the explicit title: Amantideibambini (word for word: child lovers).<br><br>
For a month, they then recorded the identities of all Internet users who visited the site despite warnings such as "Do not go further, you will be punished" appearing on the screen. The most reckless find themselves indicted. Some are accused of downloading paedophile images, others of providing pictures and photos. For several months, teams of anti-pedophile carabinieri have been regularly browsing the Internet, which led to the arrest in March of the leader of a Catholic movement.Internet users released. Two years ago, an Italian investigator infiltrated an online community to unmask ten people in Italy and fifty worldwide. Until now, the Italian police had never set up a real pedophile site. This investigation follows a first similar case that led prosecutor Ormanni to place eight Italians in pre-trial detention on 27 September and to issue 1700 indictments. As part of the investigation, a request for the arrest of three Muscovites had also been forwarded to the Russian judiciary, the three men being suspected of having proposed the acquisition of paedophile tapes through a local site. But after a few days, the Internet users apprehended in the peninsula were released. Admitting to having consulted the paedophile sites, they were quickly released, facing only sentences of less than two years for "possession of child pornography". Prosecutor Ormanni admitted that, in the end, none of the Italian defendants should be punished with effective prison sentences.The Superior Council of the Judiciary has also opened an investigation, but against the magistrate of Torre Annunziata. He is accused of having set up the spy site Amantideibambini and of having de facto "provoked crimes". The Italian law on paedophilia adopted in 1998 allows police officers, in the context of investigations, to simulate the acquisition of pornographic material or to act as intermediaries. On the other hand, the standard does not provide for the sale or free offer of paedophile documents. "In the case of Torre Annunziata, it is a question of verifying whether the investigators have remained in an intermediary role or whether, conversely, they have constituted a real offer of material from previous receivers, through the trap site," said Nello Rossi, one of the members of the Superior Council of the Judiciary. Prosecutor Ormanni attacked a hypothetical "unpunished pedophile lobby supported by political power: this lobby that has bases in Italy is composed of middle-class people, above all suspicion, who act in the open by browsing the Internet".Tense climate. This case comes in a tense climate on the subject in Italy, where some consider the anti-pedophile campaign on the Net out of proportion. "Of course, pedophilia via the Internet exists, but it is a derisory phenomenon compared to the authoritarian and censorship means used to combat it," replies Alberto Abruzzese, professor of sociology at the University of Rome, La Sapienza. He added: "People who deal with pedophilia know that on the Internet, criminal pedophilia is insignificant. The most dangerous place in terms of pedophilia remains the family."Along with other intellectuals, trade unionists, journalists and several Internet associations, Alberto Abruzzese has just signed a public appeal for a campaign to protect freedom of expression following the closure of two Roman sites accused of pedophilia.Media hysteria. In October, The Thing Roma and Avana Net were unplugged because they were releasing excerpts from the book Let the Kids... Devoted to a counter-investigation into a judicial case of pedophilia and Satanism that occurred in 1997, the book denounced the climate of "media hysteria threatening civil liberties" that surrounded the investigation. Legally sold in bookstores, the book has not had the right to be cited on the Net: the sites Thing Roma and Avana Net have been cut by their host, dependent on the city hall of Rome, without even having to decide justice. "All these cases are the result of a partly automatic reaction, that is to say social fear in the face of new technologies," notes Alberto Abruzzese, "and partly deliberate, with the proponents of a 'traditional' culture still very strong in Italy who see in the Internet a space that is beyond their control and who are therefore conducting a radical campaign. We find a pattern already known with television which, for some (Catholic associations, etc.), would represent a threat to the balances of society. There are a whole series of beliefs, superstitions, values that continue to function and are unleashed even more about the Internet."<br><br>

AN ITALIAN prosecutor has reportedly issued charges against almost 1,500 Italians and foreign nationals for offering or downloading child pornography via the web.The charges follow a swoop on 600 homes in Italy a month ago in which eight people were initially arrested on charges of possessing and trading child pornography, all of it from Russia.A weekend Reuters report called the case potentially one of the largest in Italian history and said prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni ordered 831 Italians to stand trial and called for 660 foreigners to be "tracked down and sent to Italy to answer the charges".The foreign indictments are believed to involve people in Russia, France and Malaysia.The report said a huge number of people were trapped in a complex sting operation involving a fake paedophile website set up by Italian authorities in co-operation with Microsoft Corp, called "amantideibambini" (loversofchildren), which registered 1,032 subscribers despite a number of clear warnings about its content.Of those charged, a number are accused of offering online pornographic material, and the majority face charges of downloading child pornography.Italian police reportedly said the Russian ring kidnapped children from orphanages, circuses and public parks and filmed them while they were forced to engage in sexual acts.A report by United Press International (UPI) stated that foreigners participating in the downloads also include residents of Britain, the US and Switzerland, and that video cassettes which could be ordered online include scenes of rape, torture and even murder.The report also added the FBI assisted Italian authorities in the sting operation and that an arrest warrant has been issued for a Moscow man thought to be the ringleader.<br>

As arule criminal article 73 is used in sentencing for individuals who commit crimes under article242.1, resulting in probation sentences or sentences using the lowest sanctions defined underarticle 242.1. For example, Moscow’s Dorogomilovsky district court reviewed a criminal caseagainst citizen, Kuznetsov, for distribution of child pornography, including sexual acts withchildren, on the internet network. Kuznetsov was sentenced to three years imprisonment.

It is superfluous to return to certain lobbies of pedophiles present in various countries of Europe and the world, including Italy. Old history. Already twenty years ago the prosecutor of Torre Annunziata Alfredo Ormanni, owner of the investigation on pornopedophilia online, made very disturbing statements: "In Italy there is a real pedophile lobby that could also be supported at a political level, this is not a mystery, It would not otherwise explain the lax attitude on the part of the institutions in the face of such a delicate problem" (source: Repubblica.it – 30 October 2000). And recently, on 6.6.2020, in an interview with Nuova BQ, Fr Fortunato Di Noto, the priest of Avola who lives under escort, referred to a "cultural pedophilia" that pushes for the "normalization of crime". On the same newspaper, the same date, we read the data relating to the complaints of the Annual Report on Pedophilia and Child Pornography edited by the Meter association: 323 chats, 8,489 links, 992,300 videos, and over seven million child pornography photos are incriminated.<br>

Jewish Gangsters torture and murder Nordic children in front of camera<br>
It broke out and flooded the Italians in all its horror on September 27, 2000. At one point, the press was no longer silent, but it broke up big, and even the state television companies aired reports. Italian and Russian police are said to have cooperated to roll up the case and apprehend the monsters. Three "Russians" and eight "Italians" were arrested for producing and distributing films in which Nordic children aged 2 to 12 are raped and subjected to atrocities that exceed the performance of every decent human being . In some of the films, the little charm trolls - blonde angels of innocence - wail and beg for mercy, straightforwardly tormented to death.In the days after, the bid spreads to newspapers and online stations outside Italy, but here is right from the start something that is not right. Why are there so few news outlets that choose to inform their readers or listeners or viewers about these satanic crimes that take place on a large scale, well-organized and with a very profit? It's about a torture factory with the innocentest of the innocent as raw material. Factory operators chase horror into the small ones - all natural kindness ancestry - and tear their genitals and weave limbs to pieces until death frees them and the gates of paradise open. But the adult grinning actors of the films survive and out of the factory there are films that are conveyed to money-hungry devils in a number of countries in order for them to enjoy the view of how the nobility and goodness of the Nordic race is being rowed and crushed .Yes, moneyed they must be, because a single movie can cost as much as €20,000. Who can afford it? No just anyone. Are there circuits high on straw involved and is that why the newspapers write so barely - dry and passionlessly - that was a weather forecast - and that many television channels do not cover the matter at all? You also get the sense that it's something even the boldest writers fortier . Why this secrecy and this restraint? In Italy, there is an organization called Telefono Arcobaleno run by the priest don Fortunato di Noto from Syracuse in Sicily. For four years, he and his associates have been tipping the police all over the world about sajter on the Internet devoted to paedophilia, and there were those who came across the sajten of the gang in Russia. He says that among those who have fallen into the traps they set out online for paedophiles has come across a high-ranking politician in Italy . But he refuses to reveal his name , except to Italy's President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who has reportedly shown no further interest in finding out. The attorney general of Torre Annunziata near Naples, who is leading the process, Alfredo Ormanni, has stated that there is a paedophile lobby high on straw in the corridors of power in Italian politics, and that branches up in the power elite have made the investigators afraid to get to the bottom of the matter. Then there was the bizarre thing that happened in the state-owned Italian television companies TG1 and TG3 : during the report on child and the arrests, excerpts from some horrific films are sent among the many that have been seized or posted online. Immediately thereafter, the Jewish director of TG1, Gad Lerner, comes on live to apologize. The next day, some journalists are dismissed, and the directors of TG1 and TG3 seek their own resignation, but are immediately reinstated by their superior. The incident triggers outrage among politicians and in the media and there is talk of scandal and unforgivable mistakes . Apparently because of the movie snippets from the paedophile violence. But does the skin deceive? The noise surrounding this drowns out what is the case, namely the occurrence of films of this kind and such misdeeds against children.Deceiving the skin? What was really going on between Lerner and the journalists that day? After careful review of all the sources that have been available to me, I have come to the following : Lerner probably banned the display of the report because it was too revealing : the footage shows men with striking Khazar-Jewish traits preying on white children. Far too many people could notice it and come to ask uncomfortable questions about the role of Jews in organized crimes against non-Jewish children, and more generally in the international gangster world. But the brave journalists defied Lerner's command and broadcast the report anyway . Then they got fired. The media and the politicians who spoke out in the media made an effort to lead the audience astray : they pretended to be upset about child being broadcast in prime-time TV. No one hinted at the possibility of discrepancy in TG1, and no one raised the question of the journalists' motives. Awake observers had to be surprised that the politicians and obedient journalists were more upset that the Italian people were informed of the violence against children than about this violence itself! No abstract description can replace the harsh reality these films depict. Tanned police officers arrived in a state of shock and contemplated quitting after seeing them.On the night between September 26th and 27th, 2000, 11 people were reportedly arrested : 8 in Italy and 3 in Russia . Later it turned out that the announcement from Russia was false . Italian police hold the cards close to their chests and have not wanted to reveal the identities of the 8, even though they are in jail with compelling evidence against them. As a justification, they state that they fear reactions to their families . It is a strange justification that no real Italian or Norwegian has ever been able to invoke. This can't help but reinforce the suspicion that there are members of the self-selected people we are dealing with. What are they charged with? Pedophilia, all right, but more specifically? According to CNN Italia "acquisition, reception and dissemination of paedophile material" . But Il Giorno newspaper writes that District Attorney Ormanni accuses these 8 plus 20 - including the 3 "Russians" - of "organization for the production and dissemination of child-pornographic material." Thus, it is clear that in these cases it is about people who, beyond nurturing their perversion, have done business on child pornography and sought to profit from the torture and murder of white children . It is then close to believing that the 8 + 20 are part of an international commercial network for satanic exploitation of children . Such has for centuries been the gebet of the Jews, like the slave trade in elmness, and we also know that Jews have been heavily involved in other related matters, such as those in Belgium (keywords: Marc Dutroux) and the Netherlands a few years ago. There is much to suggest that so far we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. Earlier this year, another Russian child ring - which is said to have had a British distributor - was cracked down by British police. The same investigators - led by Paolo Fortuna and Giancarlo Novelli - are also investigating other Internet sajts that have been found and reviewed by Don Fortunato, and which will be the showcase of other gangs operating with seats in Russia. The police have released some sparse information about the 8 ; of course not their ethnicity, but the following: an official at the health office of Grosseto, a businessman from Milan, a public servant in Milan, a conductor in photography from Salerno, a trader from Vallo della Lucania, a construction contractor from Ancona, a university student from Venice. There will only be 7 people, but none of my sources give details about the eighth. Is this data simply messed up along the way, or could it be because he's one of the pamps of the Italian establishment? Where all is, of the 7, all 6 are working either businessmen or public servants (bureaucrats) . Professions that Italians most hold, such as engineering, nurse, police officer, craftsman, farmer, etc. are not represented. It should have been very interesting to know the professions of the other 17 in Italy who are charged with the same crime . Otherwise, several of the 7 have family and children.Now let's deal with the three "Russians". Their identity is publicly known. The head of the organization is Dmitri Kuznetsov, 31 years old (October 2000), a well-known businessman from Murmansk . Note that many Italian media spell the name in a clumsy way as "Kuzentofv" ; I've also seen "Kuzentsov". "Kuznetsov" seems to be the right one. It was first reported that he and his two associates were arrested in Moscow at the same time as the action against the 8 in Italy , the night of 26-27 September 2000, but that is not true. Other sources want it that he was arrested in February (2000 , in Moscow) for the production and distribution of pornographic material . But - and this is a highly notable fact - a short time later he was released , and no charges will be brought against him in Russia! Very revealing! Don't think it's like foot in hose getting out of Soviet prisons! Many of the survivors of the Gulag archipelago are in a prison camp to this day; Someone's been sitting there for 60 years. The barbed wire fences and the Chaka militia with machine guns are gone, but to leave the camp and settle elsewhere in Russia, one needs permission, and applications answer the surviving Soviet bureaucracy often with a njet. By the way, how would the depleted, decomposed prisoners be able to afford to move anywhere? The Jewish communists who sent them to the prison camps have now made "capitalists" of themselves, i.e. gangsters, and turn the prices of all goods artificially high in the air by banning cheap local products from the market and by demanding "protection money" from all honorable Russian traders. But Kuznetsov, in other words, this entrepreneur of a veritable industry of violence against children , promened out of prison without having to ask for permission. Under what pretext on the part of the authorities? I've heard two different stories. One is that the Russian parliament has issued an amnesty, which applies to short-term prisoners, to create slightly less congestion in Russian prisons. CNN Italia notes that Kuznetsov was obviously investigated for violations considered less serious. Otherwise, only the Russian people themselves are brought up when justice is thus trampled in crunch under an iron-shuttered heel . The few media in Russia that are not on Jewish heels breed in impotence - so, for example, the newspaper Sewodnja . The second story is that the distribution of pornography is not a criminal offence in Russia, not even the one where children are used. This does not seem plausible, since Kuznetsov was sentenced to 3 years in prison, and imprisoned for a few months .What else do we know about Kuznetsov? Before changing pastures in 1998 and settling as a contractor in the paedophilia market, he is said to have made a living as a car mechanic . He has a villa outside Murmansk, in the countryside at Odintsovo. He also has a small apartment in the slum district of Vykhino in Moscow, where many of the videos will be produced. The marketing takes place over the Internet, and he is a self-taught computer expert. Kuznetsov was arrested in 1999 for the distribution of pornographic material, and released in May 2000 under a general amnesty adopted by the Russian parliament. He received a 3-year sentence, but was jailed for only 9 months. Ironically, the amnesty only applies to less serious crimes, such as one of the most diabolical criminals imaginable now. Moscow police claim that they were not aware that Kuznetsov produces films with the torture and murder of children . You can believe this if you're the type not to distrust anyone. But the regime in Russia is, as one should know, strongly Jewdominated, and has not diminished since the fall of communism; the Jews hold all higher positions in the gangster night (which is difficult to distinguish from the state itself) ; and they sit on all the money bags. The police like other state institutions are steeped in corruption, not least because wages are deliberately so low that officials can barely survive without accepting bribes.A moscow police spokesman claims they arrested three people in (2000) in an apartment with "large amounts of pornographic video material with children" . He is aware that Ivanov, one of the three, has participated in sexual acts with the children in the films, so the police have obviously seen many of these films. And what was Ivanov sentenced to 11 years in prison for, if not sexual abuse of children? Again, if you're ready to believe in anything, you can settle for the fact that none of the films among the "huge amounts of video material" contain such horrific scenes as Italian police witnessed in many of the films seized in Italy. But this , that is, employed with the technical affairs of the pedo industry and even appears in hundreds of videos of violence against children . The last of the three "Russians" is called and is former Soviet military. He officially owns a company that distributes videos : "Tim-O-Feev Video" , but in reality he is responsible for distributing the paedophile material ordered from Kuznetsov's organization via the Internet and paid for by bank transfers. He was also tasked with producing videos with children aged 5-12 years .Where did the torture factory find and find its raw material; where do the children come from? First, one must be aware that the herd of street children in Russia is as large as Norway's population (4 million). (Speaking of which, have you ever seen a billboard or ad in a newspaper or online where an organization asks you to become a sponsor for or adopt one of these children, a child ? Not me; there seems to be an unwritten law that only racially promoted children are allowed to be adopted and come to Norway.) The Russian Ministry of Health brings us the statistic that 2 million children between the ages of 1 month and 17 are orphans. Many infants are abandoned after birth because the pregnancy was undesirable . Russian women have between 7 and 11 abortions each in their fertile years. Moreover, many children become orphans by the mother dying as a result of unsafe redemptions and lack of care during pregnancy , and an increasing number of accidents and deaths in industry and the military . The homes of orphans are state-sponsored and have suffered terribly during the recent economic downturn and government cuts. The families are keen to survive and do not think primarily about the individual child. The small state care for guardianless children that one had under communism was the first thing that disappeared when it fell. The children ended up in the street.Consider the fate of these families and children when you hear about economic reforms and robber barons in Russia, almost all Jewish, who have become billionaires overnight to take over the people's property without charge. Also think about what the Soviet Jews did to what Russia was once well-saved and well-ordered. In the two years the Kuznetsov gang was in effect, 100 boys aged 9-15 years were "recruited". Kiril Mazurin, police spokesman - the children were picked up at train stations. They came from resource-weak problem families. Many were abducted from orphanages. Some children were paid $2.5 - $7 to find other boys willing to let themselves be filmed. Children were also kidnapped behind the backs of their parents or nanny in circuses or public parks.The Kuznetsov gang operated throughout the paedophilia market, from selling nude photos of children snapped on the beach or in the dressing room of a department store to selling films of horror scenes in which children are tortured and killed in front of the camera. The categories are called after increasing violence Snipe, Poose, Private Collection, snuff, necros. The children who had been captured were taken to the apartment in the Vykhino district of Moscow or to the villa outside Murmansk. Here they were so subjected to the most cunning and refined cruelty. The victims in the films italian police seized are between the ages of 2 and 12. They are all of Nordic race, typically blonde and angelic, while the rapists are black-haired and have Khasar Jewish features. The category of "snuff" implies that the children are tormented to the brink of death, while in the "necros" they are killed by the rapists. A young girl, of Nordic breed, 10 or 11 years old, is seen naked and hung. A little girl, aged 5 or 6, is seen stretched out on a bed with her heels to her face and features twisted in pain, while a man rapes her. A stunned girl on a tree in the woods. Mating with animals. Group rapes and group violence. There are even.m scenes of autopsies of young people. Some children appear in many films and must have been abused over a long period of time, for one can see that they have grown embossed; only the fear shines off the faces just as brightly. In one scene, a little girl whose genitals and face have been cut up with a knife is seen. Scientists are talking about a quantum leap in cruelty. Killing methods vary; some are skewered on poles, others seigpines according to the rules of art until they faint and become lifeless. One can see that the Jewish torturers and executioners enjoy their craft; occasionally they grin towards the camera.Customers, who are spread across many countries, in some cases asked via Email for guarantees that the photos are real and not photomontage. Some of them explicitly asked for films in which children are murdered. Napoli newspaper Il Mattino carried the following excerpts from an email exchange between a customer and the Jewish producers: 'Promise me you're not ripping me off,' says the 'Italian'. 'Relax, I can assure you this one really dies,' Jew replies. 'The last time I paid and I didn't get what I wanted.' 'What do you want?' 'To see them die.' Kuznetsov, who served only nine months for his crimes, finds himself at large and has opened a new sajt in which he mocks the Italian efter researchers: before the company was called "Russian Flower 2", now it is renamed "Lucky Video", a pun over the names of Paolo Fortuna and don Fortunato di Noto. On the new sajten he has posted free photos in which also children who are presumably Italian perform. Among 440 horror images shows 30 abused newborns. The message is clear: The International of Paedophilia does not give way, but asserts itself with the arrogance of those who consider themselves invulnerable and above the common law and law. It is a logical continuation of the monstrous cruelty of the Jewish commissars, Chaka and NKVD soldiers and partisans. The political conditions are frayed, but jew power persists, albeit in a new form.The Kuznetsov gang doesn't work alone. No Jew does; that is what gives them their immeasurable strength. They connect in tissues that span every country where Jews travel. They have an invisible infrastructure of services and helpers who do not unite borders and that makes everything so much easier for them than for us goers. Should there be trouble, they always have a Jew, Freemason or Marxist in the right state to ward off their danger, and their press power is a deterrent. When it pinches, they're over money bins big enough to bribe most people. Finance is one of the strongest aspects of the Jews. Fourteen financial companies are being investigated for assisting customers with loans to acquire the gang's films and photos. Two of these are Italian and hence the names, without any of my sources revealing them by name. There is, by the way, another outpouring of Zion's network and ubiquitous power: the silence that envelops all their shady affairs. We won't know who's behind it; names and images are omitted; the word Jew never gets over anyone's lips - it's - despite the fact that several of the main actors are demonstrably Jewish. You can call them Russian or Italian or whatever - just not Jewish. As Jews, they should only be identified when they act in the role of victims. We are meant to walk around with a picture of the Jew as a pious and righteous man who suffers eternal persecution in a hateful host community. Said financial companies must have had confidential connections to the gang because they gave certain loans without a guarantee and under the parol "no questions asked, none answered". Those who were granted loans are some of the main men among those who bought in films for large amounts with the intention of selling them on. The financial companies are said to have been proposed to customers by the Jews of Russia. The gang's new sap is accessed through a US server that brings one on to a Russian server. The Russian is devoted to an "important institution in Moscow" and one reaches Kuznetsov's sajt by clicking on a hypertext link in another sajt located on the server. Here we have a man who has committed crimes that can hardly get worse, and not only can he walk out of prison after only 9 months, but to the excesses resume his infernal activities - with state aid!The Russian people breed in vain. And what are we doing here in the west? Tie it to death. We don't care. It doesn't fit into the confluination of lies and cursed poems worshipped as the religion of our time, whose liturgy is full of "gas chambers" and "Jew exterminations." They have benefited from this, gagging many a critical voice. Since the end of 2000, revelations have become silent as in the grave in "our" media. If you're going to write about paedophilia, you're going to have to find an old pig in a fishing village somewhere that's touched your neighbor's daughter. The international paedophile network has high levels of protection and should not be picked on. The head of research in Italy, Alfredo Ormanni, got to feel the wrath of the establishment when he found out too much - and also splashed. He said a paedophile lobby is getting political support. After a month of research, politicians have not lifted a finger to change the law and make it more effective in the fight against paedophilia, he further complained. Firefighter Don Fortunato Di Noto has resigned from his cooperation with local law enforcement, where by virtue of his experience he was a consultant. Di Noto says that the name of a high-ranking politician has appeared in the traps laid out for the paedophiles on the Internet, and that the investigators are now afraid to get to the bottom of the matter. Already two years before the revelations, he was urged by key politicians to limit themselves to clergy. Nu tells him that he has served as a technical consultant to a number of state attorneys general, but each time someone has been set to block the investigation. Both Ormanni and Di Noto accuse the politicians and especially Interior Minister Enzo Bianco and the Minister of Social Affairs, Livia Turco, of greatly underestimating the prevalence of the problem in Italy.How big is the problem? Some 5,000 Italians have been officially accused of paedophile behaviour by this provincial procurator. Of these, 1,690 people were investigated and accused of acquiring, receiving and prevalence of child pornography during the 19 months it took to roll up the case. Along the way, another 3,000 more people joined in the police trap, a mockery called "desomelskerbarn". During this time, $600 million was transferred to the Russian Jews' account. The agents carried out about 600 house searches spread across Italy. The eight who were first arrested preferred the most extreme varieties in the Catalog of The Jews. Around 600 films have been seized - repackaged and delivered by police dressed as postmen while filming in hiding. The research began in November 1998 on the basis of a tip from don Fortunato . Twenty-eight "Italians" had been arrested and 831 were indicted when our sources dried up. Di Noto has reviewed 29,000 websites on the Internet for paedophile content. The case has branches across much of the world. Production and sale of child - that is the charge against 660 people in different European and out-of-Europe countries. Ormanni, Torre Annunziata, has sent out 2 international requests to apprehend Kuznetsov. Fortuna and Novelli have sent out "ordinanze di rintraccio" for the 660 (from Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, Holland, France, Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia, USA, Malaysia, Chile) . 1030 people made their way into the pedosaj set up by the police. A total of 2860 (video) films have been seized at the Italian border. They were all camouflaged : during the first half hour, scenes from a children's film appear , in many cases "The Flying Carpet". This is consistent with a theme that appears on the pedo-Jews' internet sajt <a href="http://www.geocities.com.memorville.ru" class="postlink">www.geocities.com.memorville.ru</a> . "Children, you can tell us yes or no. Daddy and Mom will say no, because they won't you well. They don't want you to be free, they don't want you to fly like Peter Pan. They just want you to study. We're going to let you see beautiful things, we're going to make you fly." Russian police searched Kuznetsov's villa on March 14, 2000 and seized 3,000 video cassettes and the Italian customer list. As already mentioned, the worst videos of torture and murder cost up to about 2 hundred thousand kroner. Around 20 million films for paedophiles are in circulation around the world. Every day, more than a thousand pictures of children being raped are posted on the Internet. Estimated annual turnover for this global business: NOK 50 billion.The Italian public prosecutor's office directed a request to the Russian government to shut down the companies that were recipients of the sums of money . But the answer was no, and the motive? It is said to be the unemployment rate in ravaged Russia. Jews like Kuznetsov, with financial connections, run the risk of becoming unemployed - oh my God, they've only made $600 million so far, what are they going to live on, poor people? And think of the many Russian children who get work in the gang's factory! It is good for the national economy and Russia's reconstruction. But Ormanni seems to have had his fangs pulled out and it seems to be similar in Italy: he believes the accused in Italy will cooperate with the court - and thus can avoid jail time. What!? Aren't they supposed to have any punishment? Not in Italy, either? He continues: The important thing for us is to free at least one of the children who appear in the films; if we succeed in it, we have achieved our goal. I think it's painted with great writing all over him that he's been whipped into dog-like submissiveness by meek circles of the Italian establishment. Don Fortunato's paedophilia phone had to close. He found out too much with the help of his good hackers. The political leadership in Italy has declared that paedophilia is not a serious problem in the country and that there is no paedophile network and no paedophile servers there, so we can all go back to sleep. But as we lie there in bed and let our minds wander, the words of the newspaper "Corriere della Sera" emerge from oblivion: "We could never have imagined that thousands of well-heeled people , in the midst of society, and purely of cultivated ones, find pleasure in seeing children tortured and killed." What about our own well-heeled paedophiles in Norwegian society? Why is paedophilia never on the agenda? Is that applies here too?I hear people say that violence against children is just as bad no matter who commits it, Jew or non-Jew, and that the perpetrators should be punished and evil fought without regard to race and nationality. But the fact is that it is Jewish men who rape and murder Nordic children and not Nordic men who carry themselves so against Jewish children. Is that a fact you want to displace? Would one close your eyes to the fact that The Pedophilia International, the worldwide commercial network for the sexual and sadistic exploitation of children, would not have existed without the Jews? It is my conviction that if this evil is to be had, one must acknowledge it as part of . You can't do anything about the pedo Jews until you do something about the Jews in the commons, because they're connected around the world like a single giant organism. Their influence also permeates our Norwegian society. It is, as always, with cause and effect - one does not get rid of the action until removing the cause. The case I have reviewed here is an , and I could go on with a number of others (roll-ups in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, usa, Brazil,...) . Although non-Jews are also involved, there is no doubt that the Jews are the driving force behind the paedophile network. They're the ones you run into again and again when you dig into things. On the other hand, the victims are apparently chosen for their Nordic race unit. Heed it and ask your conscience if there is a drop of racial solidarity left in your spirit. A little warmth to hand out to Nordic children in your heart? You settled on the Bolshevik Jews murdering your racial slurs; are you going to accept the same treatment on the part of the Democratic Jews? Incidentally, the Jewish Gangster Gang, which many grace to call the "Russian Mafia", operates in other areas as well, such as sex slave trading and drug trafficking. It is our children and young people who become victims of their crimes. Are you treating them to a future?</div></blockquote></div>

• November 2, 1995, El Pais, ‘Italian prosecutor investigating currency trafficking wants to question Cardinal Carles in person’; <br><a href="https://elpais.com/diario/1995/11/03/espana/815353208_850215.html" class="postlink">https://elpais.com/diario/1995/11/03/es ... 50215.html</a><br>
The chief prosecutor of the town of Torre Anunziatta, Alfredo Ormanni, told EL PAÍS yesterday that it will be he in person who moves to Barcelona to question Cardinal Ricard Maria Carles about a money laundering operation worth almost 8,000 million pesetas of which the high prelate would have been guarantor. Ormanni added that he has sent several days ago, although he did not specify how many, to the Spanish Ministry of Justice the request for international rogatory to do so. However, neither the Italian nor the Spanish Ministry of Justice is aware of this request.A source from the Directorate of Criminal Affairs of the Italian Ministry of Justice, the department in charge of processing the rogatories, told Efe yesterday that he has not yet received any request from the prosecutor's office of Torre Anunziatta. For its part, the Spanish Ministry of Justice had not received any communication on the matter last night. In recent days, prosecutor Ormanni has said on several occasions that he had already covered the aforementioned procedure. The Milanese newspaper Corriere della Sera published yesterday some statements by Carles in which he, who continues to deny all the accusations, said he knew that Interpol had been investigating in Spain the economic activities of the curia "It has not found anything and will not find anything because nothing has happened," said the cardinal. A spokesman for the archbishopric reiterated yesterday that Carles reaffirms his innocence and maintains that the accusation is absolutely implausible. "If anyone has any accusation to make, let them make it concrete because so far everything is vague."The involvement of the Archbishop of Barcelona would be, if confirmed, in the scope of the investigations revealed on October 14 on an international gang of gold and diamond trafficking and money laundering - an operation called check by check. The network used diplomatic channels from six countries to circumvent customs and 21 people have already been identified, detained or have been ordered to capture.The proceedings have advanced, Ormanni said, following the interrogation for almost 48 hours of the Milanese financier Riccardo Marocco, who in a telephone conversation with his lover Solange Vercruysse, of Belgian nationality, cited the prelate as a person who had been in charge of the operation "in Spain.<br><br>
Contradiction<br><br>
However, Marocco has incurred an open contradiction in his manifestations. While in the telephone conversation intercepted by the police he who announced to his lover Solange that who had directed the operation in Spain the archbishop of Barcelona, in the subsequent interrogation, when asked about who had informed him that the archbishop was the contact, Marocco replied that it had been Solange herself. that has decided to collaborate with the Justice, has also spoken, apparently, of other operations of smuggling of weapons and radioactive material, in addition to the trafficking of gold and diamonds.Alfredo Ormanni said yesterday that, after the interrogation of Riccardo Marocco, they have acquired "elements of confirmation" the data he already had and that Archbishop Carles seems to be the guarantor of the operation. Regarding the involvement of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), in which the money that was to be laundered in dollars would have been deposited in lira, the chief prosecutor replied: "We have to verify it, there are new data; but right now I can't talk about them. First we have to listen to the cardinal." Members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy do not enjoy special jurisdiction in Spain.On whether Carles would have participated in a single recycling operation or more, Ormani replied: "I can't tell you." Out of discretion or because we don't know yet? "For reasons of secrecy of the summary," he said. Do you think Riccardo Marocco has been able to novelize his statements? "I don't think, I don't think," he replied.The prosecutor added that it seems "normal" that Ricard Maria Carles is making repeated denials about his alleged involvement in the events. And he also said that he is confident that the Vatican will not put obstacles to investigate the IOR - "I think something can be achieved" - although the Vatican authorities are not very willing to collaborate.”<br><br>

Author: Andrew Gumbel<br>
It began, like all the best thrillers, with a mysterious death. Last July a colonel in Italy's military intelligence service, Mario Ferraro, was found hanged from a bath rail by his dressing gown cord. Less than a year later the affair has mushroomed into a global conspiracy fresh from the pages of an improbable blockbuster.Colonel Ferraro, it turns out, was working to unravel a massive global traffic in arms, drugs, radioactive materials and gems. And where he started, prosecutors from Torre Annunziata, near Naples, have carried on, following a trail of smugglers, dirty money recycled from the war in the Balkans, and murky interests in high places.This weekend came the most spectacular blitz so far; a flurry of arrests and investigations featuring the oddest array of suspects. Among international figures wanted for questioning are Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra- nationalist presidential candidate; Ricardo Maria Carles, the Archbishop of Barcelona; a Somali businessman; and Licio Gelli, the Grandmaster of the illegal Italian Masonic Lodge, P2.Between them, this motley crew is named in connection with trafficking everything from Kalashnikovs to plutonium, and re-cycling the profits through some surprising channels including the Institute for Religious Works, better known as the Vatican Bank.Mr Zhirinovsky is suspected of coordinating the sale of nuclear materials via his secretary, who acts as a honorary consul in Russia for the Liberian government.Meanwhile, Archbishop Carles was responsible, according to one key witness, for transferring some $100m illegally from the Vatican Bank to a Swiss businessman.In all, hundreds of people in more than 10 countries are suspected of taking part in the racket, which apparently began to provide weapons to Croatia and Slovenia at the start of the Balkan wars, and then turned around 180 degrees when the arms market in the former Yugoslavia became saturated.The traffickers bought up small arms in Bosnia and Croatia and sold them, accepting the drugs, gems and nuclear materials in a massive, highly complex international barter system.Quite how prosecutors stumbled on a criminal conspiracy of this magnitude is not clear, since much of the evidence has remained confidential. But it seems the case started with an intercepted cellular telephone call made by a Neopolitan fishmonger. Colonel Ferraro almost certainly died because he knew too much. The magistrate in charge of the inquiry team, Alfredo Ormanni, believes they have reached a crucial stage by uncovering the core mechanism at the heart of the operation, code-named "Cheque to cheque" by Italian police.There could be more revelations to come. A former colleague of Colonel Ferraro's, Francesco Elmo, has written a memo combining fact, confidential intelligence and rumour that would make any prosecutor's hair stand on end.Did Yasser Arafat sell 30 kilos of gold to swell the PLO's coffers? Was the Somali businessman in cahoots with the disgraced former Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi? Were submarines traded illegally in Albania's territorial waters? We will have to wait for prosecutor Ormanni's next move to find out.<br><br>
• June 9, 1996, ‘To the transaction in the Vatican’; <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/zurtransaktion-in-den-vatikan-a-ad408b95-0002-0001-0000-000008933093" class="postlink">https://www.spiegel.de/politik/zurtrans ... 0008933093</a><br>
Prosecutors in Italy are investigating new dark dealings of the Papal Bank. The investigation is aimed at celebrities - including Cardinal Ricard Maria Carles, Archbishop of Barcelona.When the inconspicuously elegant gentleman disappeared into the telephone booth of a Milanese hotel, he had a leather suitcase with him. A little later, he was arrested in the lobby, but the bag had disappeared. Carabinieri they later discovered under a flap hidden in the floor of the telephone booth, an obviously more frequently used hiding place.The arrested person's name is Francesco Elmo and he was formerly an agent of the Italian military intelligence service Sismi. According to the competent public prosecutor's office of Torre Annunziata near Naples, he belongs to an international ring of arms dealers, money launderers, nuclear and diamond smugglers. The criminals had found themselves in the early nineties in arms deals for the warring parties in the former Yugoslavia - with contacts to political celebrities.According to the investigators, the Russian nationalist leader and presidential candidate Vladimir Zhirinovsky as well as Licio Gelli, former head of the banned secret lodge P2, which had infiltrated the Italian state from within, are said to be involved in the dark deals. But the most piquant: The Archbishop of Barcelona, Ricard Maria Carles, is also said to be involved in a huge illegal money laundering operation. Everyone has denied.For more than two years, Italian and American authorities have been tracking the global network; in Italy, the search operation is ironically called »cheque to cheque«. Dozens of middlemen were arrested in Italy, Spain and the US in 1995. At the end of last week, the investigators from Torre Annunziata sent 32 new arrest warrants and 31 investigative notices all over the world. For the Vatican and its IOR (Istituto per le Opere di Religione), which is based in the Papal States, a procedure could be very unpleasant. The IOR, actually intended for the management and investment of the funds of religious orders and religious foundations, does not disclose balance sheets and is not subject to Roman banking supervision. On Vatican soil, its clerical managers are safe from access by the Italian police.In the early eighties, the IOR under its then president Archbishop Paul Marcinkus was involved in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano, in which about 1.5 billion dollars disappeared in a sophisticated worldwide system of letterbox companies.Despite some attempts at reform, the bank in the Vatican has apparently not found the way of purification. As late as 1991/92, the largest bribe sum in Italian post-war history, the equivalent of about 110 million marks for large companies and parties, was demonstrably laundered through the IOR - the Monsignori do not want to have known anything. Then it became quiet around the Vatican Monetary Institute, until a few days ago.In the "cheque-to-cheque" affair, the IOR is now said to have participated again. A Milan financier arrested in 1995, Riccardo Marocco, has told investigators about a planned operation to illegally exchange 240 billion lire (about 210 million marks) for Kuwaiti dinars available at the Vatican Bank. Several such transactions through the IOR are mentioned in the documents of the suitcase courier Elmo, who apparently acted as an intermediary between IOR and the "sellers" of dirty money.SPIEGEL has some of these documents. In them, about two delivery offers are presented, which were addressed to (now known to the police) German-speaking interested parties of money laundering operations. One was about the purge of 50 billion lire. Step by step, the process of money laundering in the shadow of the Vatican is described. In the quoted text, the buyer refers to a customer of the IOR, the seller to those dark men who want to exchange their dirty notes at the Papal Bank for unsuspicious value - for a hefty commission for the bank at the Holy See."The buyer and the employee of the buyer's bank organize a meeting with the seller and an accompanying person in the Vatican to discuss the said transaction again," the offer reads. "At this meeting, the seller is shown deposited cash available for the said transaction. The transport of the goods to be delivered to the Vatican as well as the transport of the currencies from the Vatican are also organized by the buyer. After the meeting, the seller and his companion are brought out of the Vatican again through diplomatic channels. A short time later, the seller with the previously discussed tranche amount will be picked up at the designated location by themeans of transport organized by the buyer and taken to the Vatican for the upcoming transaction."The money smugglers solemnly promise: "If the prescribed procedure is strictly adhered to, we guarantee a one hundred percent clean execution of the transaction."The suspicion that the Vatican Bank was to be involved in a criminal action here against its will and without its knowledge was obvious. That is why the public prosecutor's office of Torre Annunziata had the documents checked by an expert from the Italian central bank. According to prosecutor Paolo Fortuna from Torre Annunziata, this came to a clear conclusion: "An attempt at fraud to the detriment of the Vatican Bank must be ruled out. These are real operational plans."Even more sensational are the accusations made by the prosecutor against the Spanish Cardinal Ricard Maria Carles, Archbishop of Barcelona. He is said to have been involved in an illegal exchange of 100 billion lire into 65 million dollars, covering it with his venerable name in money laundering circles.A first request by the public prosecutor's office to hear the high gentleman as a witness was rejected by the Spanish authorities in January. Now the Italian investigators are following suit. In a second request for mutual legal assistance, they want to ask their Spanish counterparts to be allowed to interrogate the cardinal - this time as an accused. However, the investigators themselves do not rule out that the clergyman was used.Senior prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni told SPIEGEL: "In the meantime, however, we not only have Marocco's statements, but a whole series of complementary testimonies on the accusations against Carles." The Vatican has defended itself against the suspicions in the strongest possible terms.It is possible that a scapegoat has already been found and sacrificed in advance. Before Christmas, two Vatican inspectors travelled to Barcelona to check the finances of the diocese there. The responsible head of department, Abel del Ruste, not an ecclesiastical dignitary, was dismissed from office after the inspection.<br><br>

Spain <br>
The Italian prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni has withdrawn, for lack of evidence, the accusations that he had maintained for two years against Cardinal Ricard Maria Carles. The accusations were based solely on a telephone conversation intercepted by the police in which the defendants referred generically to the "bishop of Barcelona", but without mentioning names. Despite the fact that the defendants insisted that it was the code name of one of their contacts, it was not until a month ago that the judge in Torre Annunziata (Naples) was asked to dismiss the accusation. Msgr. Carles declared that "it has been two years of suffering and slander" and lamented "the excessive delay" of the withdrawal of the accusations.<br><br>

Author: Pinto Vincenzo, Sibilla Michelemaxi raid: among the accusations also the attempted murder of a policeman * the incidents broke out during the C1 derby: they brought 60 people to the hospital * the investigators used television recordings and photographs to identify those responsible * they discovered that many are prejudiced * yesterday at dawn the operation with 250 policemenCAMPANIA Clashes Turris - Savoy: 54 thugs in jail Maxi - raid: among the charges also the attempted murder of a policeman The incidents broke out during the C1 derby: they took 60 people to the hospital. Investigators used television recordings and photographs to identify those responsible. They have discovered that many are prejudiced. Yesterday at dawn the operation with 250 policemen TORRE ANNUNZIATA - It was called operation "Offside". It was taken at the first light of dawn yesterday. It involved about 250 men between the police forces of Torre Annunziata, Torre del Greco and agents of the Naples Police Headquarters. An unprecedented manhunt, a cleverly stretched net around those responsible for the accidents that occurred before, during and after the Turris - Savoy derby on January 18th. An exceptional deployment of forces for the case, the one coordinated by the quaestor of Naples, Arnaldo La Barbera, in collaboration with the deputy quaestors Urti and La Rotonda. In handcuffs 49 people, mostly prejudiced; 5 others are missing from the appeal, fugitives, but around whom the circle would be about to close. The "Fuorigioco" operation arose from an investigation conducted by the chief prosecutor of Torre Annunziata, Alfredo Ormanni, on the basis of photos and television documents relating to the incidents that characterized that derby. There are, therefore, 54 recipients of the custody orders, 21 of which were issued in prison by the gip Tommaso Miranda; 33 those under house arrest or with the obligation to stay at home. The alleged offenses range from threats and resisting a public official, injury, damage, interruption of public service, obscene acts and attempted murder. Gaetano Borriello, from Torre del Greco, is accused of this last crime, prejudiced for resistance and injuries, who, according to the prosecution, tried to strangle a police inspector with a belt. House arrest also for the eighteen-year-old son of the vice president of Turris, Vincenzo Acampora. Among the recipients of custody orders, prejudiced for criminal associations, robbery, receiving stolen goods, drug trafficking, evasion, theft and smuggling. An operation, therefore, that finds no precedent for facts related to football. Prosecutor Ormanni commented: "The deprivation of freedom becomes the only remedy to safeguard the right to fun that animates the vast majority of sportsmen. We need to restore social dignity to all football and prevent public disorder from taking over. If to achieve this it is necessary to put "offside" those who have nothing to share with sport, it is our duty to take note of it". Ormanni also forwarded to the Juvenile Court the documents concerning the position of 6 minors. The investigations continue, in the crosshairs of the investigators there would be other possible perpetrators of that afternoon of guerrilla warfare. Meanwhile, the interrogation of the gip against the arrested detainees in Poggioreale is scheduled for tomorrow morning. ----------------------------------------------------------------- To make so much effort in the space of 24 hours the Campania football scores two unenviable records: a raid, in full style of the anti-Camorra blitz, never seen in this dimension against the professionals of the deviated and criminal supporters; and the first game, Turris - Juve Stabia, which today is played on a neutral field, in Avellino, for reasons of public order. There is nothing to boast about, of course: both the political and police authorities have now fully understood the level of alarm. Of course, the Campania case is the limit one: in a frighteningly degraded social situation, all the Sunday aberrations related to the ball take on very particular coloring and gravity. But the bad plant, unfortunately, tends to grow everywhere. And so it becomes even more urgent that this cleaning operation has all the support it deserves: on the field, in front of the microphones, in the meetings of the managers, in the way of hearing and seeing the game from the stands. We all have to take a step back and help calm the climate around the favorite show of Italians. Without this contribution, the work of those 250 policemen will be wasted. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Ben 60 wounded that cursed January 18 TORRE ANNUNZIATA - (v.p.) It happened all that afternoon of January 18 in Torre del Greco. That Turris - Savoia (serie C1, group B) was a high-risk derby for the ancient rivalry between the two centers (Torre Annunziata and Torre del Greco are just 8 kilometers apart) were aware of it a bit 'all. The summit in the Prefecture the day before the match had delegated to the police station of Torre del Greco, directed by the deputy quaestor Gianfranco Urti, the organization of the order service at the stadium. Three hundred men including policemen and carabinieri, canine units, a helicopter to monitor that the fans did not come into contact. And in fact things at the beginning had gone well for the small presence (about twenty) of supporters in the wake of Savoy. The problems for the police began when the bulk of the guest fans arrived in Torre del Greco on foot, walking along the tracks of the Circonvesuviana. Near the torre del Greco station, the first launch of objects began, including from balconies and windows, which was answered with stone throwing that broke several glasses of homes and shops. Reaching the stadium under escort, the Savoy fans peacefully witnessed the course of the race. It was at the final whistle that the most serious riots broke out: first on the rectangle of the game, then in the streets adjacent to the stadium. More stones, assaults on the police who made charges and tear gas canisters. In the end, more than 60 people were injured and bruised, about twenty of them among the police. ----------------------------------------------------------------- The Prefect: "Strong signal to give dignity to sport" In addition to repression, also prevention: for this turris - Juve Stabia today was moved, Thursday, to Avellino. Macalli of the League of C: "The problem is the fields" THE REACTIONS NAPLES - This time from words we have moved on to deeds. It will be a circumstance, a strange coincidence, but a few days after the committee for the protection of public order on Monday wanted by the Prefect of Naples, comes the news of the arrests after the incidents of Turris - Savoy. The Prefect, Dr. Romano, comments: "It is a strong signal that had to be given. I really appreciate the way in which the operation was conducted and carried out. The reasons for the measures then speak for themselves. In most cases we are faced with people who have little to do with the world of sport, people accustomed to delinquency. Our hard line towards them will be firm." Not only repression, however, but also prevention. The derby between Turris and Juve Stabia will be played in Avellino. The prefect points out: "We have the obligation to take these exceptional measures when there are real conditions for doing so. It is our responsibility that imposes this on us. We hope to restore dignity to the whole football movement and to the moments of sport. We hope that these measures will be a point of arrival and not a point of departure". Among those arrested there is also the son of Vincenzo Acampora, vice-president of Turris, who says: "We strongly condemn those responsible for the incidents, to play the game against Juve Stabia away from Torre del Greco is an untimely measure. It was more logical to temper the climate and play the game in Torre del Greco. People are very disappointed and some fans are afraid of the climate that has been created." Salvatore Moxedano, CEO of Savoy, applauds: "It is a very important signal that the police wanted to give. If to defeat violence it is necessary to arrive at this too, so be it. The judicial authority and the police have all our support". Mario Macalli, president of the Serie C League: "This is the first time that we react so harshly to accidents. That is right, it must be done this way, but we hope that it will improve the situation. After all, the government is also on this path. In the specific case, I must say that torre del Greco is a stadium at risk, whose position is very delicate: it is necessary that the Municipal Administration assumes its responsibilities, because doing the C1 on that field is a big problem ".<br><br>

• October 30, 2000, La Republica, ‘Ormanni and Don Fortunato “There is a pedophile lobby: But the magistrate admits “I have no name to make”; <br><a href="https://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/scandalo/scandalo/scandalo.html" class="postlink">https://www.repubblica.it/online/politi ... ndalo.html</a> NAPLES - "In Italy there is a real pedophile lobby, which could also be supported at the political level, this is not a mystery", and then again: "When we collaborated with several prosecutors in the investigations on pedophilia, someone fell to block the investigations". Two sentences, two very heavy indictments: to pronounce the first is Alfredo Ormanni, prosecutor of Torre Annunziata - owner of the investigation on pornopedophilia online. To deliver the second blow is Don Fortunato Di Noto, the parish priest of Avola, who has always been at the forefront of the fight against pedophilia. All around the predictable political storm with the Pole attacking the Minister of the Interior, Enzo Bianco, who defends himself by threatening lawsuits.Everything stems from Ormanni who before taking part in the top of the Public Administration Committee on pedophilia in Naples mentioned the political lobby: "It would not be explained otherwise - added Ormanni - this lax attitude on the part of the institutions in the face of such a delicate problem". At the exit of the meeting, the magistrate confirmed his statements, specifying however that he was not able to provide the names. The harshest answer Ormanni reserved for the Minister of Social Affairs, Livia Turco, who had spoken of it as an "electoral campaign". "It is certainly not up to a magistrate to do it."As for the decision of Don Fortunato Di Noto to interrupt the collaboration with the investigators, the prosecutor said. "He had problems, things happened that I know, and that at the moment he does not want to say believing that he must report them to the President of the Republic: it is his personal choice and that cannot be criticized".And the priest, founder of Telefono Arcobaleno was no less harsh: "There was an obstructionism against us: when we were present as technical consultants of a series of prosecutors, someone swooped in to block the investigation. When there are or have been investigations by the carabinieri on online pedophilia, the postal police arrives and says that only she must do the investigations".Don Fortunato shares the statements of the prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni about the existence of a pedophilia lobby in Italy that has political support: "We denounced it two years ago and in four years we made 29 thousand complaints. But it is already a technical obstacle is the fact that Minister Bianco says that there are no pedophile servers in Italy and this is not true. In our country there is a profound underestimation of the problem". The priest also promises: "He will give Ciampi the name of an excellent character, we will see if they have the courage to deepen", he tells Tg5. Except then retract later: "I have no excellent name to reveal".The indictment is signed and relaunched by the exponents of the Pole who take the field alongside Don Fortunato, turning the accusations to the Minister of the Interior Bianco, from Forza Italia to An the chorus is unanimous: "The pedophilia alarm seems suffocated by the apathy of the minister who, in order to confirm himself, discredits and diminishes the value of Don Di Noto's complaints, leading the latter to a decision that will certainly harm the investigative development against child pornography sites."The response of the Viminale was immediate, replying with an official statement: "The minister has never said or thought that the pedophilia phenomenon does not exist in Italy. It is unpleasant, even if humanly understandable that someone can misunderstand on the basis of journalistic reports, attributing to the minister statements, interpretations or comments that he did not make"."It is inadmissible that this is done by those who, instead, know the reality of things and decide to ignore it." Therefore, "if we continue to attribute to the minister positions not expressed by him, attributing to him statements even contrary to his thought in order to make demagoguery, defamation or slander Bianco will be forced to take legal action to stem this malpractice".<br><br>

Don Di Noto: "Never spoke of excellent names"<br>
And meanwhile Violante wand the magistrate<br>
ROME - The storm around the investigation into the pedophilia of Torre Annunziata does not subside. After the intervention of the Minister of Justice Pietro Fassino, who asked for the acquisition of the statements made to the media by the prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni, it is learned that the Superior Council of the Judiciary is also investigating. Not only on the alleged "leak", not only on Ormanni's statements (on the possible existence of a pedophile lobby within the political world); but also on the story of the so-called "trap site".The first referent commission of Palazzo dei Marescialli, that is, will also ascertain whether there has been, on the part of the investigating magistracy, "activities of provocation of crimes in the context of the investigation". To ask for the expansion of the investigation in this sense was the professional councilor Nello Rossi, of the Democratic Judiciary. "The commission - specified Rossi - will have to verify if the prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office of Torre Annunziata were aware or had authorized or promoted the activity of establishing the site. I made the request on Saturday morning, before the political outcry that followed Ormanni's statements. The question that needs to be answered is whether we have not gone beyond the investigative activities carried out undercover, provided for by the law of '98 against pedophilia. This law provides only for the acquisition of pornographic material and the activity of intermediation".<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Minister of Grace and Justice Piero Fassino has given the order to acquire the video and press materials relating to the statements of the prosecutor of Torre Annunziata. The materials, the minister specified, will be transmitted to the general inspectorate of the ministry and to the general direction of the judicial organization "for an evaluation of these statements and their consistency".And the priest, who today was supposed to participate in a conference in Rome but who at the last moment gave forfait, returned this morning on the controversial issue: "We have never declared that there are excellent names in the investigation, we must be careful of journalistic exploitations and montages of statements made in a certain way in television studios, making one thing mean for the other, as unfortunately it happened to me to have to find in these days. And that's incorrect."A retreat that comes on the day when the storm that has been unleashed around the Prosecutor's Office of Torre Annunziata has spoken, even if indirectly, the president of the Chamber Luciano Violante. "I believe - he said - that magistrates must speak through their acts. Everything they say beyond the sentences is wrong."</div></blockquote></div>

"Investigations like this lead to the brink of despair," even alfredo Ormanni, a senior prosecutor who was hardened in mafia investigations, described the gruesome scenes last week.Violence against children between two months and twelve years of age, sometimes with a pistol to the head. Sex with Animals, rape to death. The tormentors did not shy away from hanging or impaling girls and boys, and still passed on corpses. The producers allegedly collected up to 40,000 marks per video when the victims turned in agony and finally died. About the images of an infant whose body was slit from the throat to the legs, prosecutor Paolo Fortuna reports: "We initially thought we had the recording of an autopsy in front of us."Crime scene of the scary scenes: Russia. "Children for such recordings are easy to find here," admits Moscow police spokesman Kirill Masurin, "there are a lot of neglected minors, often children of alcoholics, who seek their fortune in the capital." Italian prosecutors issued international arrest warrants for three Russian citizens. They produced the videos not far from Moscow and sold them via the Internet via the US provider Geocities.The Italian public is not only outraged by the monstrous crimes of the producers. The nation of proverbial childhood love was in shock when it learned that Italian customers were giving "directing instructions" for the videos via email. They wanted to be sure that the children were really suffering and that "real blood" was flowing (see box p. 366). Eight men between the ages of 19 and 26 were initially arrested by the police on suspicion of proliferation, and 1600 private individuals are being investigated. When the evening news of the state broadcaster RAI showed sequences from the bestial videos last week, the head of the program had to take his hat off. At the end of last week, six of the eight defendants were already at large. They had confessed their guilt and were sentenced to twelve to 18 months in a fast-track trial: the sentence was suspended. Chief Prosecutor Ormanni: "A mockery that our law makes possible."Thousands of children are victims of criminals in the worldwide data network, complains Sicilian priest Don Fortunato, who has just been appointed deputy head of the Unesco project Innocence en danger. Since he founded the Internet research group "Telefono Arcobaleno" for the protection of minors four years ago, he and his volunteers have been hunting for around 24,000 web pages. In November 1998, he gave the investigators in Torre Annunziata the decisive tip. The clergyman estimates the success of searches against the international pedophile mafia to be low. "We must finally take note of the fact that these are not a few sick people, but a global network that enjoys the protection of political and legal circles." He had seen abused children grow up over the years.According to the investigators, the Russian dealers collected 600 million dollars, ten percent of which came from Italy. According to the Italian news magazine "Panorama", the rest of the sum was largely transferred by Internet customers from the USA, France, Belgium, Germany and Russia. A thriving industry that the alleged boss of the gang, Dimitrij Kuznetsov, does not want to be smashed. Because child pornography is not considered a serious crime in Russia, Kuznetsov, who was imprisoned in this regard, was released on June 26 in a major amnesty. "He went to the diving station for half a year," it is said from militia circles. "He works like a madman to be able to afford new technical equipment for his business," say others.Otherwise, the scandal hardly resonated in the Russian media. "The whole thing is concealed because it does not fit Putin's promise that he will create order in the country," speculates Moscow political scientist Leonid Sedov. After all, Kuznetsov owes his release to Putin himself: The newly elected Russian president had given the people the amnesty according to old tsarist custom as a "gift" when he took office.Kuznetsov is always a clever businessman. After the Italian manhunt success became known, he took advantage of the unexpected publicity and put video films on his new homepage for free. The scandal does not seem to have triggered shame or dismay among consumers: in three days, it was clicked on 3879 times.I WANT TO SEE IT DIE Dialogue on the Internet: "Who guarantees me that it is not a photomontage?" – "Calm down, I guarantee that the child is really dead.

Spain: Accused of involvement in dubious traffickingBarcelona, 5 December 1997 (APIC) Accused by the Italian Public Prosecutor's Office of being involved in currency laundering linked to the trafficking of nuclear weapons and materials, Cardinal Ricard Maria Carles, Archbishop of Barcelona, is relieved: Alfredo Ormanni, Prosecutor General of Torre Annunciata (Naples), informed the investigating judge that the steps taken two years ago had been stopped and asked him to archive the file.Although the decision to definitively close the proceedings rests with the investigating judge, there is no doubt that the investigating judge will do so, given that the prosecution itself so requests."The Spanish authorities have erected a wall in this case," the Barcelona daily "La Vanguardia" told the Barcelona daily. A. Ormanni, referring to the fact that, on two occasions, the Spanish Ministry of Justice refused an international letter rogatory, which would have made it possible to question the Cardinal of Barcelona. The prosecutor of Torre Annunciata admits that he does not have "sufficient evidence" to accuse the prelate.Summoned as a mere witness in the first letter rogatory, Cardinal Carles was summoned as an accused in the second in July 1996. One of his auxiliaries said at the time that the archbishop "has never refused to appear in court and he will gladly do so if the Spanish Ministry of Justice so decides." A year ago, following rumors announcing a third rogatory commission, the cardinal said he had already made a written statement "of his own free will." He also noted that he was the third cardinal to be the subject of "baseless" attacks – along with cardinals Bernardine of Chigaco, now deceased, and Groer, archbishop emeritus of Vienna. (both accused of sexual abuse).Today, the Cardinal of Barcelona is satisfied. His joy is "that of a hostage who has just been released." The cardinal says he is the victim of a slander and claims to have been mistreated by a certain press which, according to him, has shown "a particular interest" in this case in order to raise suspicion on him. The archbishop excludes legal action, both against the Italian public prosecutor and against the media that exploited this case, "provided that no new elementsintervene and that the case is effectively archived," he told the Barcelona daily "Avui".

It is incredible to what extent the facts are falsified and those who then not only do not have the corresponding criminal reproach are judged in advance, but it is discovered that they were the object of, in the best of qualifiers, the most frivolous accusations. It is true that the moral damages suffered can then be claimed judicially, but the citizen distrusts the courts, especially in "resonant" or "social alarm" cases. In these cases it is not known whether the judges will apply objective legal criteria, use what is now called "alternative use of law" (pure and hard Stalinism), or take advantage of the matter to hit another jurisdiction that believes that it invades competences. (I am not speaking without foundation: Preysler and Alcocer cases, the latter "by legal imperative").But let's not get off topic, since all this comes in line with three news that deserve, at least, a comment: the arrest of Apostolos Mangouras, captain of the "Prestige", the sentence to 24 years in prison of the former Italian Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti, and the suspension for millionaire fraud of the Italian prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni.On the captain of the "Prestige" the most brutal trials have been poured, denying him the most elementary right to the presumption of innocence, to the point that he has had to go out to defend him in the press, with a documented article, his lawyer José María Ruiz Soroa, where, among others, he brought up some very striking similar cases, such as that of the "Urquiola" (captain acquitted by judgment of the Supreme Court) or that of the "Aegean Sea", (captain sentenced to a negligible penalty and compensation of 300,000 pesetas). In both cases (1976 and 1992) the responsibility fell on the Spanish State. But the captain of the "Prestige" has already sunk into the depths of the ocean. Andreotti, perugia's court of appeal, has convicted him of the 1979 murder of a mafia investigative journalist, and the "progressive" media have already upheld, directly or subliminally, that conviction, caring little that the politician had been acquitted on the same grounds in 1999 and downplaying, above all, the infamous manipulation of the case. And doesn't the reader remember the monumental scandal that was organized a few years ago when the prosecutor Ormanni tried to mix the Cardinal Archbishop of Barcelona, Monsignor Carles, in a money laundering operation? Well, now it turns out, no less, that this prosecutor has been suspended from his position because he is attributed a fraud of 20 million euros!, as I read in "La Vanguardia". The former Socialist Minister of Justice Belloch had good and prudent reason for refusing to process the requested rogatory commission.All these cases are or have been useful as throwing weapons of some interests against others. But the sad and hard thing about reality is that the "Truth", the one that derives from naked facts or firm sentences, seems to be of no interest to almost anyone and even, when it is known, it is almost annoying and occupies a miserable corner in the media.<br><br>

Salvatore Moxedano, Antonino Pane, Agostino Mosella and Augusto Aveta are under house arrest. The former administrators of Savoia Calcio di Torre Annunziata were joined by an order of custody under house arrest on charges of bankruptcy and destruction and concealment of accounting records. The custody orders, issued by the gip Tommaso Miranda at the request of the prosecutors Paolo Fortuna and Giancarlo Novelli, carried out last night, have come to the end of the investigation coordinated by the prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni, who have ascertained a hole of about 21 billion old lire, caused by the sale of black players, falsification of surety policies and registrations of fictitious payments and capital gains and even the appropriation of the proceeds of entire subscription campaigns. The investigations were initiated by the Guardia di Finanza after in the summer of two years ago the sports club declared bankruptcy and was ousted from the C1 series championship. Then the bankruptcy was declared at the request of the Public Prosecutor's Office last January, following an investigation into management irregularities. With regard to Moxedano and Pane, the prosecutor had asked for custody in prison, but the request was rejected by the Gip. The Guardia di Finanza has also notified measures prohibiting the profession to the auditors of the companies Arturo D'Alessandro, Luigi Sparano and Giulio Lusa. Pane (in the photo), in recent months, had tried to buy Sampdoria, but the deal was blocked by a blitz of the Guardia di Finanza and today he is the president of Isernia who plays in Serie D.<br><br>

The young agent of the Guardia di Finanza watches bored the quiet comings and goings of lawyers and the public. Entry is obligatory: the only rotating cylinder of metal detectors inoperation. A second is broken, as well as the sliding tape where the bags and packages are examined. It is a year after the beginning of the cyclone that hit the offices of the Public Prosecutor's Office on the fourth floor of the already barefoot building, in operation for ten years. On the bulletin boards, a communication on the redistribution of civil hearings. From Monday, after the summer break, the trials resumed, the magistrates returned from vacation. It is the return to the courtrooms.The Palace of Justice of Torre Annunziata. The usual piles of sheets for photocopiers, the usual lockers piled up with files, with those signed "Castellammare" as masters, the usual barred door on the fourth floor, where you can access some offices of the Public Prosecutor's Office. Almost a year after the cyclone hit the chief chancellor Domenico Vernola, with the discovery of billionaire stables for reimbursement of expenses, fake advice, non-existent investigations. A cyclone that hit Alfredo Ormanni, the chief prosecutor who had piloted the office since its birth, forced to leave the judiciary, in order to defend himself with more serenity.And in the office there is a widespread sense of disorientation and demotivation. The names are not said, but some magistrates, who had requested and obtained as their seat the Prosecutor's Office of Torre Annunziata, were frightened. And they gave up. While six have their suitcases ready. They are practically all the "senators" of the office, the magistrates who have managed the main investigations of this Prosecutor's Office that has become thirteenth in Italy for the number of files opened every year: no less than ten thousand, only against known people. Between October and November, Paolo Fortuna and Giancarlo Novelli will take up their duties at the Naples Public Prosecutor's Office. Enzo Ferrigno will follow them closely, while Ciro Cascone will move to the Public Prosecutor's Office for minors in Milan. And it's not over. Francesco Rossetti is destined to take service at the Court of Appeal of Naples, while Andrea Nocera will go to the Neapolitan Court. A real hemorrhage. That the Attorney General's Office is preparing to arrest, at least in the fall, with a flurry of applications. The office cannot remain with a vacuum of 6 Pm out of 10."It is precisely this that worries us more than anything else – says Elio D'Aquino, president of the Criminal Chamber of Torre Annunziata – The ministry cannot abandon a border judicial headquarters like ours. It must support it, with adequate staff In court there are twenty units of staff missing".In a week, the criminalists of Torre Annunziata will meet to examine the situation. They are also concerned about the danger of "undiscrimanate fuss" about the work of the Public Prosecutor's Office, which has demonstrated its importance over the years. He does what he can, to buffer emergencies, the deputy prosecutor Rosario Cantelmo, regent of the office since ormanni's resignation. Just yesterday, a young Pm arrived from Caltanissetta to replace Annamaria Pezzullo, who had been gone for some time. There is an air of waiting. When, in a month, the plenum of the CSM will decide, between Diego Marmo and Gianfranco Izzo, the name of the new chief prosecutor of Torre Annunziata, programs can be made in the office. Certainly, the new head will have his organizational ideas, he will evaluate his judicial policy on the staff gaps and on the six judicial police officers investigated in the Vernola investigation. Until then, nothing will move. Of the 22 agents investigated, some are retired, others work in locations other than Torre Annunziata. Six remain, convinced that they can prove their extraneousness from the accusations of embezzlement. Thus, an understandable guarantor attitude circulates towards them: waiting for interrogations is the watchword.<br><br>

From Rome<br>
Luxury cars and dream trips for magistrates, clerks, employees, judicial police officers. Expenses and waste up to 40 million euros. Pharaonic credits on ghost consultancies, billionaire payment mandates issued in his own name by the chancellor at the center of the scam of the century in the prosecutor's office of Torre Annunziata headed by Alfredo Ormanni, now retired. Pursuing, depending on the individual positions, hypotheses of crime ranging from embezzlement to forgery, the Roman public prosecutor Luca Palamara has requested the indictment of thirty people, including the former chief prosecutor himself, the chancellor Domenico Vernola and the former marshal of the carabinieri of the Vico Equense station, Enzo Vacchiano (investigator of the "Ilaria Alpi" and "Cheque to Cheque" case). As for Vernola, already sentenced to four years on appeal for having appropriated the equivalent of 20 million euros by falsifying payment mandates for justice costs, his position is also part of this procedure that next January 26 will land before the gup Claudio Carini. On the same day, the same gup, will find himself deciding on the behavior of Ormanni regarding another issue concerning alleged abusive interceptions ordered by him.The procedure 45599/02 takes shape at the same time as the inspection of the accounting records ordered by the Ministry of Justice in the judicial offices of the Campania district. The results of the administrative report delivered to the CSM highlighted obvious irregularities in the management of a judicial machine defined as "decidedly anomalous, serious, worrying, at times illegitimate and regular".The administrative and criminal investigations in the end, in large part, gave similar results, especially with regard to the timely falsification of the so-called model 21 (used for the settlement of justice costs) at the base of most of the cash shortages. In the report of the 007 of via Arenula, as well as in the Roman investigation conducted in tandem by the prosecutors Palamara and Silverio Piro, we focus on the role played by the Grand Chancellor (who was challenged 181 payment mandates for millions of euros in favor of himself) who having had from the head carte blanche on the management of money, he would have offered lunches and dinners, dispensed economic favors, given expensive cars to a small group of people. It would have been, in short, what the ministerial inspectors called "the true dominus of the Prosecutor's Office" around which various types of benefits would have revolved, which would also have benefited Ormanni and his family by taking advantage of an "important" car fleet (a Cherokee jeep, a Nissan Micra, an Opel Frontera, a Mercedes A-Class, a Mercedes Clk 200) and a free package of 23 trips all over the world.According to the ministerial investigations merged into the file sent to the CSM, Ormanni would have "centralized in his person and at his secretariat all the liquidations of the costs of justice" in a perspective that, given the results, "appears absolutely illogical and unjustified". If only because - say the 007 of the keeper of the seals - the control on the methods of liquidation would have emerged serious profiles of illegitimacy. An example? The "mission advance" for 500 million old lire liquidated without problems to the marshal of Vico Equense.The lawyer Ettore Stravino, defender of the former chief prosecutor of Torre Annunziata, shows himself to be combative: "The accusations of competition in peculato moved against my client do not stand and on January 26 we will prove it to the gup of Rome. Alfredo Ormanni should be an injured party in this proceeding, the responsibilities must possibly be ascribed to others». Injured party and investigated at the same time seems to be, instead, Domenico Vernola. He himself, the Grand Chancellor who in seven years would have managed to steal as much as 20 million euros through 166 counterfeit mandates.<br><br>

Author: Karmentxu Marin The chief prosecutor of the town of Torre Anunziatta, Alfredo Ormanni, told EL PAÍS yesterday that it will be he in person who moves to Barcelona to question Cardinal Ricard Maria Carles about a money laundering operation worth almost 8,000 million pesetas of which the high prelate would have been guarantor. Ormanni added that he has sent several days ago, although he did not specify how many, to the Spanish Ministry of Justice the request for international rogatory to do so. However, neither the Italian nor the Spanish Ministry of Justice is aware of this request.A source from the Directorate of Criminal Affairs of the Italian Ministry of Justice, the department in charge of processing the rogatories, told Efe yesterday that he has not yet received any request from the prosecutor's office of Torre Anunziatta. For its part, the Spanish Ministry of Justice had not received any communication on the matter last night. In recent days, prosecutorOrmanni has said on several occasions that he had already covered the aforementioned procedure. The Milanese newspaper Corriere della Sera published yesterday some statements by Carles in which he, who continues to deny all the accusations, said he knew that Interpol had been investigating in Spain the economic activities of the curia "It has not found anything and will not find anything because nothing has happened," said the cardinal. A spokesman for the archbishopric reiterated yesterday that Carles reaffirms his innocence and maintains that the accusation is absolutely implausible. "If anyone has any accusation to make, let them make it concrete because so far everything is vague."The involvement of the Archbishop of Barcelona would be, if confirmed, in the scope of the investigations revealed on October 14 on an international gang of gold and diamond trafficking and money laundering - an operation called check by check. The network used diplomatic channels from six countries to circumvent customs and 21 people have already been identified, detained or have been ordered to capture.The proceedings have advanced, Ormanni said, following the interrogation for almost 48 hours of the Milanese financier Riccardo Marocco, who in a telephone conversation with his lover Solange Vercruysse, of Belgian nationality, cited the prelate as a person who had been in charge of the operation "in Spain.<br><br>
Contradiction<br><br>
However, Marocco has incurred an open contradiction in his manifestations. While in the telephone conversation intercepted by the police he who announced to his lover Solange that who had directed the operation in Spain the archbishop of Barcelona, in the subsequent interrogation, when asked about who had informed him that the archbishop was the contact, Marocco replied that it had been Solange herself. that has decided to collaborate with the Justice, has also spoken, apparently, of other operations of smuggling of weapons and radioactive material, in addition to the trafficking of gold and diamonds.Alfredo Ormanni said yesterday that, after the interrogation of Riccardo Marocco, they have acquired "elements of confirmation" the data he already had and that Archbishop Carles seems to be the guarantor of the operation. Regarding the involvement of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), in which the money that was to be laundered in dollars would have been deposited in lira, the chief prosecutor replied: "We have to verify it, there are new data; but right now I can't talk about them. First we have to listen to the cardinal." Members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy do not enjoy special jurisdiction in Spain.On whether Carles would have participated in a single recycling operation or more, Ormani replied: "I can't tell you." Out of discretion or because we don't know yet? "For reasons of secrecy of the summary," he said. Do you think Riccardo Marocco has been able to novelize his statements? "I don't think, I don't think," he replied.The prosecutor added that it seems "normal" that Ricard Maria Carles is making repeated denials about his alleged involvement in the events. And he also said that he is confident that the Vaticanwill not put obstacles to investigate the IOR - "I think something can be achieved" - although the Vatican authorities are not very willing to collaborate.</div></blockquote></div>

embezzlement’; <a href="https://www.linkiesta.it/2012/10/spariti-20-milioni-processo-almagistrato-accusato-di-peculato/" class="postlink">https://www.linkiesta.it/2012/10/sparit ... -peculato/</a><br>
"Disappeared 20 million", trial of the magistrate accused of embezzlementAlfredo Ormanni had become famous in June 1996 for having promoted and coordinated as head of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Torre Annunziata the "Cheque to Cheque" investigation, relating to an alleged and gigantic criminal organization dedicated to the trafficking of weapons, radioactive material, gold and credit securities, as well as to widespread money laundering operations at an international level. An investigation stemming from the revelations of a fixer linked to the Italian military secret service, and which had involved excellent figures such as the Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovski, accused of buying and selling the rare metal used to build thermonuclear power plants, the archbishop of Barcelona Ricardo Maria Charles, investigated for illegal currency brokerage carried out through the Vatican bank, the head of the P2 lodge Licio Gelli and his son Maurizio, as well as European and African businessmen and entrepreneurs. Figures that seemed to open investigative tracks and working hypotheses on a wide range of mysteries, including the murder of Ilaria Alpi and the massacre of Loockerbie. In the work of the investigators, enormous professional and financial resources were invested. But when it came to the attention of the judge for the preliminary investigations, after years of searches, interceptions, seizures for billions of lire, the investigation was entirely closed because its results had proved to be devoid of consistency. And so what had started as the investigation of the end of the century ended up in oblivion.After 16 years, the investigation is back in the news, albeit indirectly, in the courtrooms of the Criminal Court of Rome. And precisely in the tenth Trial Section, where a trial has been underway for a long time that also involves the Campania magistrate, now retired. At the center of the complex story that sees him accused next to the former chief chancellor of the judicial offices of Torre Annunziata Domenico Vernola, the former marshal of the Carabinieri of Vico Equense Enzo Vacchiano, and about thirty officials and members of the police of the district, there is the hypothesis of an illegitimate appropriation of almost 20 million public euros. The former magistrate is accused of the crime of embezzlement, for having authorized with his signature the drafting of 181 false payment warrants concerning numerous investigative activities including the same "Cheque to cheque", with the aim of collecting significant reimbursement of expenses.Thejudicial proceedings underway in the capital is the last and most relevant strand of a story born exactly ten years ago, when the inspectors of the Ministry of Grace and Justice led by Arcibaldo Miller discovered large cash shortages in the accounting records of the Prosecutor's Office. It is at that moment that the magistrate and the registrar are entered in the register of suspects on charges of embezzlement and forgery. The investigators, at the time directed by the Capitoline prosecutor Luca Palamara, discover an impressive amount of false payment certificates, billionaire credits for fictitious consultancies, illegal interceptions relating to a single criminal proceeding. All operations, according to the investigators, are carried out by the judicial and administrative leaders of Torre Annunziata, promoted in their name and with their full and direct responsibility. The economic resources obtained thanks to the fraudulent mechanism would have been used to give luxury cars, expensive off-site trips and dream trips, to judges, clerks, employees, investigative police officers. The latter are indicted for money laundering and receiving stolen goods.At this point, however, the process is separated and divided into three directions. And it is necessary to remember that from the charges of abuse of office and illegal interceptions Ormanni was acquitted. To photocopy the decrees of telephone and environmental registration to justify activities never carried out and collect an amount of over 320 thousand euros, was Vernola, sentenced on appeal to four years already served. The third proceeding remains standing, which sees the two highest managers of the office accused of material falsity and embezzlement. A very long and troubled judicial process, underway for over six years due to repeated changes in the judicial panel. And that after four cancellations and as many shots, just as the hour of truth approaches, risks ending in prescription. The deadline is set for 2014. In the long span of time the Court of Auditors had the opportunity to promote an accounting judgment asking the former magistrate for compensation of 90 thousand euros, 320 thousand euros to the chancellor. But the decision will come only in the aftermath of the criminal sentence.Verdict that will revolve around the role played by the prosecutor in the implementation of the criminal design. The investigations carried out by the inspectors of Via Arenula and transmitted to the Superior Council of the Judiciary shed light on "obvious irregularities in the management of a decidedly anomalous and at times illegitimate judicial machine". But if on the administrative level Chancellor Vernola appears as the neuralgic figure in disposing of money and in giving favors of various kinds, it is all to evaluate the position of the main legal responsible of the Prosecutor's Office. According to the thesis of the prosecution, it was Ormanni who unnecessarily centralized on himself and on his secretariat all the liquidations for the costs of justice, and to provide with his signature the placet and the green light to the interweaving of irregularities concocted by the high official. Around which revolved the privileges that would also benefit the prosecutor and his family: a prestigious car fleet and a free package of 23 trips to every part of the world.Signatures and regalia are relevant factors for the prosecution to prove the responsibility of the magistrate. But on the same elements promises battle his defender. Ettore Stravino, a long-time lawyer of the Neapolitan forum, explains why his client "is absolutely unrelated to the charges and if anything injured party of a vast embezzlement operation carried out by the chancellor of the Public Prosecutor's Office with the weapons of deception and falsehood". The acronyms of Alfredo Ormanni at the bottom of the fraudulent documents would have been obtained in a captious way, inserting the payment forms inside the ordinary mail that was visited every day by the judge, and falsifying their signature when it was away from its headquarters. And the gifts received by Vernola would in fact all be regularly paid by the magistrate, "who took advantage of facilitations in the purchase thanks to the relations of the chancellor's brother with some car manufacturers". Animated by a fighting spirit, the lawyer is willing to dismantle every piece of the plant built by the Capitoline prosecutors. Starting from the hearing scheduled for Thursday, when the testimonies of numerous colleagues of Ormanni, long active and engaged in the judicial offices of the province of Naples, will be heard. It will be the umpteenth stage of a procedural history perhaps destined to remain unanswered.<br><br>

Maxi stangata of the Court of Rome against the former chief prosecutor and the famous "golden chancellor" Travel, fake payment warrants, refunds for investigative missions abroad, luxury cars and parties in renowned restaurants: twelve years after the scandal and the arrest of the super chancellor Domenico Vernola and the suspension of the head of the Prosecutor's Office of Torre Annunziata, Alfredo Ormanni, comes the first instance sentence for 26 defendants. Twenty-one very heavy sentences, partly mitigated by pardon and prescription, five acquittals for the slow and corrosive pace of the elapsed time. Disregarding the bland requests of the public prosecutor, the judges of the Court of Rome who since 2010 have started the trial after numerous stops, have imposed 91 years in prison on the defendants and the accessory penalty of dismissal for public employees.Criminal association aimed at embezzlement, forgery and money laundering charges from which the former magistrate, the chancellor – already sentenced to 4 years of imprisonment in 2004 for other similar episodes -, employees of the court of Torre Annunziata, members of the police, family members and figureheads of Vernola the golden man who from 1994 to 2002 collected over 30 billion of the old lire thanks to fake payment mandates.The tenth section of the Court of Rome closed the trial at first instance at 11:30 p.m. on Friday, January 17. A black Friday for Alfredo Ormanni to whom his former colleagues have imposed six years of imprisonment for the warrants issued from January 15, 2001 to September 24, 2002, a period in which Vernola escaped from the Court and the glories of the oplontino courthouse, between international investigations, trips to prestigious locations, luxury cars and parties in well-known clubs, they faded behind the scandal of the billionaire shortfall. Ormanni – for whom the prosecution had asked for a sentence of two years and 8 months of imprisonment – was found guilty not only for the warrants signed in the period after 2001 (for the previous ones came the sponge of the prescription) also for the trips made from March 2001, to August 9, 2002. 'Phantasmagoric' trips, paid by Domenico Vernola with the money of the State, to Ormanni and his family, in exotic destinations. The defense of the former prosecutor of Torre Annunziata, now a lawyer, who claimed to have been deceived and that those warrants were falsified by the same chancellor who affixed – 'overwriting' it – his signature was worthless. And then there were the cars, the luxury ones, given by Vernola himself to Ormanni. The six years inflicted on Ormanni will have to be scaled up by three from which he will benefit as a result of the pardon. Heavy hand of the judges also on the same clerk, already sentenced to 4 years, in the first trial to which another 5 years were inflicted continuously for the mandates issued from 2001 to 2002. Same sentence for the brother of the supercancelliere, Mario Vernola and for his wife Fulvia Mayer, the brother of the latter Vladimiro, lighter penalties for the other family members including his daughter Stefania accused of having laundered the money stolen from the Court of Torre Annunziata and the Ministry of Justice to buy apartments and luxury goods. Also convicted was the court employee Emilia Salomone, at the time in service to the model 12, who – trusting in her innocence – had been among the few to renounce the prescription. Accused of having obtained a personal loan from Vernola a few years before the scandal broke out, she was considered an accomplice of the chancellor and sentenced to 3 years and six months of imprisonment, almost totally covered by the pardon, but risks dismissal. And then there is the long list of law enforcement officers, many of whom are still serving in their respective administrations sentenced to sentences ranging from 3 years and 8 months to 5 years of imprisonment.They are the men of the 'missions', of the millionaire reimbursements for investigations never carried out or uploaded to investigation files at the time famous as Cheque to Cheque and the disappearance of Angela Celentano. They were part of the entourage of Domenico Vernola and Alfredo Ormanni and some of them had collected mandates for tens of millions of lire: among them the agents Massimo Pisciotta, Giuseppe Abete, but also Vincenzo Vacchiano – former marshal of the carabinieri station of Vico Equense -, for a period spearhead among the investigators who collaborated with the oplontini magistrates. These were the golden years in which the court 'bulwark of legality' against organized crime in the Vesuvian and Stabiese area, was at the center of national and international media attention also for investigations that crossed European borders and then hundreds of millions of lire were spent on telephone interceptions, bedbugs, sophisticated electronic devices, but also for missions abroad and in Italy. A 'grandeur' from payment mandates with six zero figures, designed for his accomplices by Don Mimì Vernola and signed by the then prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni. A 'grandeur' ended in October 2002 when it was no longer possible to keep the scandal hidden. An arrest warrant was issued against Vernola by the then deputy prosecutor Francesco Paolo Rossetti. Vernola disappeared, only to surrender himself days later in the prison of Rebibbia. Ormanni relented after trying to justify his work, suspended by the Csm. And the Court of Torre Annunziata was sifted through by the magistrates of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Rome and by the inspectors of the Ministry of Grace and Justice and the Court of Auditors. On Friday, January 17, 2014, the 26 defendants were sentenced to 91 years in prison, most of them swept away by the pardon and mitigated by the statute of limitations for the length of a trial that seemed to never end.<br><br>

The defendants were accused of looting the Palace of Justice of Torre Annunziata: 20 million euros looted, through a game of false mandates for payment of refunds and judicial advice, orchestrated by a chancellor with the responsibility of the chief prosecutor, Alfredo OrmaniIt took 13 years to extinguish the crimes of which the main defendants of the looting of the Palace of Justice of Torre Annunziata were accused: 20 million euros looted, according to the prosecution, through a game of false mandates for the payment of refunds and judicial advice, orchestrated by a chancellor with the responsibility of the chief prosecutor.It took 13 years and yet it happened: the sponge of the prescription canceled on appeal the sentences of six and five years in the first instance of the former head of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Torre Annunziata Alfredo Ormanni and the former supercancelliere Domenico Vernola. Both were at the bar in Rome – competent when a Neapolitan magistrate is involved –in a trial with 21 defendants for crimes ranging from criminal association to embezzlement, forgery and money laundering. The Court of Appeal ruled 11 prescriptions, 8 convictions for money laundering and 2 acquittals on the merits. Blame the biblical times of a trial of the first degree during which the judging panel changed ten times. A lawyer explains: "Even the charges of aggravated money laundering should be prescribed in a month, they will not even have time to file the reasons: the judges took 90 days to draw them up". It will be enough to file an appeal to the Supreme Court, and the prescription will also start for many of the convicted on appeal. And so many greetings to the criminal responsibilities of one of the most colossal scandals of the Neapolitan province of the last decade. It exploded violently in 2004, at the end of a ministerial inspection, which challenged Vernola a fraudulent round of reimbursements for justice expenses. The chancellor was suspended and dismissed, an investigation was opened involving the prosecutor Ormanni, signatory of hundreds of mandates of payments considered fake, and Vernola's relatives, suspected of having turned over the money collected by the chancellor through fake 'sent to himself' to turn them into cars, houses and luxury goods.The costs of justice of some important investigations of Torre Annunziata are in the crosshairs: this is how some members of the judicial police forces that materially conducted them also end up under investigation in Rome, presenting expense reports also considered fake or inflated. The GUP decreed the indictment on May 25, 2006. But the process starts in slow motion because the judging panel changes all the time. And every time we start all over again. Audiences celebrated only to fix postponements. Without preliminary investigations. Without testimonies. A firm process. It started in practice only in 2012, when finally the college 'stabilized'. Then two years of hearings for the judgment at first instance. And two for the fixation of the appeal. 'Normal' times, on which, however, the long initial stop weighed.Then the only defendants who have waived the statute of limitations to obtain a full acquittal stand out as two 'heroes'. Their names are Emilia Salomone and Sergio Profeta, respectively chancellor in Torre Annunziata and police inspector of the police station of Sorrento. Assisted by lawyers Francesco Matrone and Giuseppe Ferraro, the chancellor and the policeman had been convicted in the first instance and fired in the trunk. They will now be entitled to reinstatement and lost entitlements. The years lost in the long tunnel of justice, those are not: they are lost forever.<br><br>

The premise, necessary and fundamental, is that we must not draw hasty conclusions; it has already happened, in the past not too much past that something viscous and obscure is agitated <br>
and emphasized for purposes other than those that are officially declared and that appear; and we do not exclude that there is a good dose of imbecility, upstream of everything; to be honest: it can very well be a huge, umpteenth, hoax; there have been several mega-maxi-investigations then miserably dissolved like air bubbles; to myself and everyone I remember, for example that of almost twenty years ago, baptized "Phoney Money"; the prosecutor of Aosta David Monti applied himself with zeal; even then there was talk of a "devastating occult society that conditioned the institutions", and they wanted to slip into half the world, up to the White House ... Those who have a little memory will then remember the investigations of unforgettable Agostino Cordova, Alfredo Ormanni, Luigi De Magistris; and let's stop at these three. Who knows this, "exploded" today, and of which with great emphasis they talk about the news, write sites and tomorrow the newspapers will reserve, I imagine, entire pages.Prudence and caution; but let's play the game, for now. So: there is a consortium, small and in any case powerful, technologically savvy, well branched, which spies on half the political world; it is not one faction against another, to use news of "elegant dinners" and other shearing for the benefit of Tizio against Caio. No, here you "watch" regardless. Mario Draghi is "supervised", when he is the number one of Bankitalia; Silvio Berlusconi, Mario Monti, Matteo Renzi, and their entourages are "watched". Even Daniele Capezzone, who certainly will not be "supervised" as an ex or post radical; but, more credibly, in the period in which he was Berlusconi's spokesman, a tireless externalist of his thought (and by dint of confusing his thought with that of Berlusconi, anticipated by the barking of Dudù, he was removed). In other words, three people are "watched", who — it cannot be a coincidence — are at various times Presidents of the Council. This is what "unites" them.Well: there is a clump of interest and interests that "supervises" the presidents of the Council, beyond the political collocations and possible colors: Franza or Spain, as long as it is magna ...It would seem to me this, the most disturbing aspect — if you want to take seriously (and it is not said you have to do it) — what we are told in these hours: this lump of interest and interests, above and outside the institutions, long identified, finally hit (they themselves know that something looms, they know that they are "supervised" in turn). It is something labyrinthine, in which one gets lost. And even if it is all a mystification, it may be worth asking who mystifies why and on whose behalf.To continue (but also for the moment conclude) with this "game" of concatenations, I have not been able for a few days not to think of a reflection that although publicly externalized by someone will have been caught, but no one seems to have paid attention to it. The "reflection" is this: "... The international political situation is such that the period in which the United States provided for the military defense of a Europe dedicated to rebuilding and increasing its economic and industrial potential can be considered over. The end of the blockades has given many countries the opportunity to carry out their own policy. We are attacked by a small but very aggressive enemy, also because it is supported by the interests of some nation that aims to weaken us without wanting to appear. To get the better of those who offend us, we must go and look for him where he lives and make him harmless, hitting him economically, and if necessary militarily, even those who support him and do not desist from doing so ...".Now this "reflection" is from December 28, published on page 4 of the "Foglio", a response to an article by Giuliano Ferrara who four days earlier had argued, with his pyrotechnic style, the need to create a European Guantanamo. The "reflection" is signed by a former general of the carabinieri, who knows so much, and when he speaks he measures his words with the precision of an old pharmacist who manually prepares his medicines: General Mario Mori. "We are attacked...". We who? Italy, or Italy and...? And what interests are pursued, with that attack that is brought to us? The small and very aggressive enemy we immediately understand what it is; but supported "by the interests of some nation that aims to weaken us without wanting to appear"? And you see what kind of reaction/defense is suggested to us...I am not a diversionist, I am not the son of dietrologi; I tend, by instinct and reasoning not to the accumulation of facts, rather I am congenial to the opposite procedure, simplified, scarnific. But with a gloom made even more restless by the effort to find a method in this madness that surrounds us, I observe what happens; and perhaps it is not a useless operation to devote some attention to it; and see what sum to get from these two plus two that sometimes do not always make four.<br><br>

EUR 12 million’; <a href="https://www.ildubbio.news/2018/07/01/assolta-alla-corte-dei-continon-basta-restituisca-12-milioni-euro/" class="postlink">https://www.ildubbio.news/2018/07/01/as ... ioni-euro/</a> The case in the prosecutor's office of Torre Annunziata: accused of corruption renounces the prescription to obtain justice, is declared innocent but is forced to compensate the State Almost twenty years of judicial ordeal and an acquittal because the fact does not constitute a crime. But then the joke: despite not having committed any crime, Emilia Salomone, judicial assistant at the Court of Torre Annunziata for 40 years, will have to pay about 12 million euros in tax damages. Seven million euros jointly and severally with the "golden chancellor" Domenico Vernola and 5 million and 700 thousand euros (in competition) with the then <br>
prosecutor Alfredo Ormanni. This was established by the Court of Auditors on appeal, which despite the acquittal in the ordinary trial decided that the judicial assistant helped to pocket <br>
About 30 billion lire in Vernola, scratched to the State thanks to a series of false payment mandates. "For the Court of Auditors mine would not be a full absolution – says the woman to <br>
the Doubt -. This is despite the fact that I am a sixth-level employee and should therefore not even appear before the accounting magistracy. It was the leader who had to answer for it."<br>
That story, for the Campania Public Prosecutor's Office, was a real earthquake. Everything revolved around the figure of Vernola, who for years would have falsified the payment warrants, <br>
collecting from 1995 to 2002 as many as 176, with which he had been reimbursed, together with some agents of the judicial police who ended up with him at trial, about 16 million euros, with <br>
the "visa" for liquidation, in fact, by the former prosecutor Ormanni. Solomon's fault had been that of having registered, with his signature, 103 orders to the so-called model 12. Without <br>
intent, according to the Court of Rome that acquitted her on appeal, after the woman had waived the prescription to prove her innocence. With "a repetitiveness and continuity such as to make it at least fully aware of the absolute anomaly of mandates always headed to Vernola", instead, according to the Court of Auditors, which in judgment 117 of 2017 speaks of "malicious <br>
acquisition (...) to the fraudulent system devised by Vernola'.These were payments made in the absence of documentation, for non-existent criminal proceedings, missions never carried out, even during periods of vacation and leave. Unjustified and exorbitant payments, even from 7 thousand euros per mission. Anomalies of which Solomon became aware, reporting them to her superior, who however reassured her. "As soon as I realized that something was wrong - she explains - first I reported everything to my manager, who reassured me, saying that they were expenses covered by secrecy and, therefore, self-titled. I told him twice and to tell the truth I was worried, but more for an administrative fact: I never thought that Vernola was stealing».<br>
No suspicion, in fact, had touched Solomon: he trusted the chancellor. "He was a sui generis guy and very messy in his work, so I attributed his shortcomings to that," he explains. But to create the suspicion of the Prosecutor's Office first and then of the Court of Auditors was a loan from Vernola to the woman. "I never asked him for that money – he says – I had only asked him to <br>
introduce me to the director of the bank, because I knew that there were good relations between them". That money was used for the purchase of a property, a purchase for which Solomon <br>
would have liked to access a subsidized loan. But Vernola never introduced the director to the woman, proposing another solution. "He told me that his sister, widow of a general and without <br>
children, had a lot of money on her side and that she would do it with pleasure, also because in this way she would pay less taxes - she says -. We also did a private writing, they said they didn't <br>
want anything in return. I just had to limit myself to giving back 5 million a year."Solomon and her husband received 50 million each, all paid by cheque, of which they returned 25 million, again by cheque. "After his arrest, having no contact with his sister, I stopped," headds. But that loan, for the Court of Auditors, would have been proof of Solomon's participation in that fraudulent plan set up by Vernola. "I have never falsified anything – he underlines -. I simply wrote down the payments, in a register that was then checked by the Public Prosecutor's Office. The case before the Court of Auditors was supposed to be a civil case, but I felt judged again. They decided to condemn me, but in reality I did nothing. And I wish we knew."The payment mandates that Vernola made out to himself, in fact, were controlled by the post office passing, finally, by the State Accounting Office and the Court of Auditors. "So those who condemn me are those who, with more skills than me, then checked those mandates considering them valid," he adds. But as mentioned, Solomon's fault, according to the Court of Auditors, would have been that of not having denounced, after having noticed the anomalies, continuing to record the payment mandates. For the accounting judges there would have been, therefore, an effective causal contribution. If he had reported everything, they dispute, the tax damage would have been in fact contained and all discovered years before.That loan, therefore, for the judges would have been Vernola's way of "buying" it, despite the fact that this eventuality was excluded by the judges on the merits. And despite the fact that it was the chancellor himself who exonerated her, reporting to the prosecutors that he had misled the woman. Solomon has now filed a revocation, hoping that the situation can be resolved. "I hope that some magistrate will listen to me – he says -. When the first sentence came for me it was a cold shower. I was removed from work for more than three years, people looked at me like a thief. I waived the statute of limitations because I wanted to prove to everyone that I was innocent. Others have not. And although the acquittal sentence became final in October 2016, I only started working again in September of the following year. The money they ask me I would not even know how to count – he concludes – but I will have to pay this tax for life, despite not having done anything».<br>

under the attention of the ecomafie parliamentary commission, with an investigation already open and a series of steps to be taken in the coming weeks. There is maximum attention on the <br>
destruction of Avis, the factory closed for almost a decade, especially after the story of a former worker who indicated from the columns of Metropolis the exact point where tons of asbestos <br>
were buried. An article ended up on the table of the commission, which in the meantime has found new witnesses to reopen the encore investigation into the poisoning of the industrial site. <br>
In fact, there are other workers willing to speak and to supplement the testimonies of the previous investigation. Among the searches, an old file opened by the then prosecutor of Torre <br>
Annunziata, Alfredo Ormanni, then ended up in the reimbursement scandal that involved the oplontino prosecutor in the early 2000s. Well the investigation started in the 90s and was also <br>
supported by photographic material, which testified to the presence of asbestos in the subsoil. For a few years workers were listened to and evidence was collected, but the real culprits were never identified.<br>

GRUDGE KILLING<br>
Russia’s president ‘probably approved’ the radioactive assassination of ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko in London, a British inquiry has found.<br><br>
LONDON — A prominent Russian dissident was assassinated in London with a deadly dose of radioactive poison because he had claimed that Vladimir Putin was a pedophile, according to an independent British inquiry.<br>
The hit was “probably” carried out on the personal orders of the Russian president.<br>
The allegation—that Putin had used his position as head of the Russian intelligence service to destroy video evidence of himself having sex with underage boys—was “the climax” of an increasingly bitter personal feud between Alexander Litvinenko and the Kremlin leader.<br>
Sir Robert Owen, a retired High Court judge, found that this personal animosity, combined with Litvinenko’s continued criticism of the Kremlin and the FSB, of which he was once a senior member, was the motive behind his brazen murder in a Mayfair hotel via a pot of green tea laced with the radioactive isotope polonium-210 in November 2006.“The FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr. Patrrushev, then head of the FSB, and also by President Putin,” Owen told the Royal Courts of Justice on Thursday.<br>
“There was undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism between Mr. Litvinenko on the one hand and President Putin on the other,” he wrote in his report. “Mr. Litvinenko made repeated highly personal attacks on President Putin culminating in the allegation of pedophillia in July 2006.”<br>
The claim was made in an article on the Chechen separatist website Chechenpress shortly after Putin was filmed lifting the T-shirt and kissing the stomach of a young boy at the Kremlin.<br>
Litvinenko claimed this display of affection was the first public sign of a secret that had long been known by some within the KGB. He said Putin had been denied a place in the foreign intelligence division as a young recruit “because, shortly before his graduation, his bosses learned that Putin was a pedophile.”<br><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">“Many years later, when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for the presidency, he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials,” Litvinenko wrote. “Among other things, Putin found videotapes in the FSB Internal Security directorate, which showed him making sex with some underage boys.”</span></strong><br>
Thursday’s announcement has been 10 years in the making. The British government rebuffed Marina Litvinenko’s pleas for an inquiry into her husband’s assassination for eight years because diplomats feared that London’s improving relationship with Moscow would be severely damaged.<br>
A secret letter written to Owen by the Home Secretary Theresa May in 2013 explained why no inquest had been allowed. “It is true that international relations have been a factor in the government’s decision-making,” she admitted.The government would change its mind a year later, when Russia’s conflict with Ukraine and the shooting down of passenger jet MH17 ended diplomatic niceties.The explosive conclusion of the report will do little to calm relations between the nations, even though Owen stops short of saying he has conclusive proof that Putin ordered the hit directly.<br>
The inquiry heard that two Russians, Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun, carried out the killing a few yards from the U.S. embassy in London by pouring polonium-210 into a pot of tea they offered to the former Russian spy.<br>
Neither man still worked for the Russian state directly—Lugovoy had left the FSB and Kovtun was no longer employed by the Army. But Owen quoted an old Russian saying in his 300-page report: “There is no such thing as a former KGB man.”<br>
On day 22 of the inquiry, when ample evidence had already been heard that Lugovoy was behind the killing, President Putin gave him a national award “for services to the fatherland.”<br>
Owen wrote: “Mr. Lugovoy’s award, given in particular its timing and public nature, can only be interpreted as a deliberate sign of public support made by President Putin... It can be inferred from these facts that the Russian State approves of Mr. Litvinenko’s killing.”<br>
On Thursday, Marina Litvinenko spoke on the steps of the court to welcome the verdict. “I am of course very pleased that the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr. Putin have been proved by an English court.”<br>
But she was less complimentary about the British government, which has been briefing journalists that it will not levy severe sanctions against Moscow at such a sensitive time in negotiations over the future of Syria, ISIS, and President Bashar al-Assad.<br>
The widow wants a British version of the Magnitsky Act, which President Obama signed in 2012 imposing sanctions against the killers of Sergei Magnitsky.<br>
“I’m also calling for the imposing of targeted economic sanctions and travel bans against named individuals... including Mr. Putin,” she said. “It is unthinkable that the prime minister would do nothing in the face of the damning findings of Sir Robert Owen.”<br>
The British government announced Thursday that it would freeze the assets of Lugovoy and Kovtun and issue international arrest warrants, even though Russia has made it clear the men will not be extradited.<br>
For a litany of reasons, Alexander Litvinenko was not a popular man in Moscow. As he lay in ward T16 at University College Hospital on Nov. 18, 2006, two Scotland Yard detectives on the graveyard shift were about to discover why.The pale patient, who was experiencing excruciating but unexplained pains, had been booked into the hospital as Edwin Redwald Carter. After two weeks at a smaller hospital in North London, he had been moved to the city’s top medical facility by doctors who could not work out what had made him so sick.His symptoms were consistent with radiation poisoning, but Geiger counters showed no sign of radiation. As his condition worsened, thalium was another suspected cause, but no trace was found.Clueless as to what substance was gradually destroying his body from the inside, “Edwin Carter” and his wife were increasingly convinced that he had been poisoned. They called in the police.Detective Inspector Brent Hyatt and Detective Sergeant Chris Hoar arrived at around midnight to ask why they thought poison had been used. They were stunned by what they were about to hear.<br>
“In Russian, I have [another] name: Alexander Litvinenko,” Carter began, in faltering English. “I am former KGB, FSB officer.“1997, I sent to top secret department of KGB my, my department has duty killing... political and high business men without verdict—judge verdict.”He said the first target of these extrajudicial killings was to be Boris Berezovsky—a fallen ally of Putin.“After I, I had this order, I said to my boss, ‘I’m, I refuse take this.... It’s not right, is not justice.’”<br>
And so began Litvinenko’s post-FSB career, which included a series of lurid claims about Russia’s mafia state. Once he had escaped Russia and was granted political asylum in Britain in 2001, he claimed the KGB and the FSB had been run through with corruption, accused it of murders, kidnappings, and drug-dealing and, most extraordinarily of all, staging a false-flag terror operation in Moscow.He alleged that the 1999 Moscow apartment bombings, which killed some 300 people, were masterminded by Russian security forces in order to justify a full-scale war against Chechnya and bolster the popularity of a young, hardline prime minister named Vladimir Putin.Litvinenko was paid $2,800 a month as an informant for MI6—Britain’s foreign intelligence service. He also took a salary from Berezovsky, the man he says he was once ordered to murder. The oligarch had also fled Russia and was granted asylum in the U.K. in 2003.Berezovsky, who was found hanged in March 2013, paid Litvinenko to help him research and write articles and publications that were critical of Putin. Litvinenko also offered himself for hire to private intelligence companies, and the inquiry heard that he had been working for the Spanish authorities, who were trying to crack down on Russian crime syndicates operating there.In the spring of 2006, Litvinenko met the famous activist journalist Anna Politkovskaya in a coffee shop in London. He asked her to leave Russia and continue to fight against Putin’s regime from outside the country.She decided to stay in Moscow and was shot dead in the elevator inside her apartment block on Oct. 7. In the following weeks, Litvinenko told a gathering at the Frontline Club, a foreign correspondents’ association in London, that Putin had ordered her assassination.A month later, he was gravely ill and recounting his own extraordinary tale to a pair of confused Scotland Yard detectives.<br>
The inquiry heard several theories about who had ordered two former Russian agents to strike him down in what was described as “a nuclear attack on the streets” of London. In one theory, he was silenced before he could publicly describe links between Spanish criminal networks and senior Russian officials.<br>
The inquiry also heard that Litvinenko had written a report that claimed that Viktor Ivanov, the head of Russia’s narcotics agency, had links to the Russian mafia and was engaged in drug trafficking and money laundering while working closely with Putin in St. Petersburg in the 1990s.<br>
Litvinenko himself seemed relatively unconcerned about which one of his public statements had ultimately cost him his life.<br>
He told the detectives at his bedside: “I have no doubt whatsoever that this was done by the Russian Secret Services. Having knowledge of the system, I know that the order about such a killing of a citizen of another country on its territory, especially if it is something to do with Great Britain, could have been given by only one person.”<br>
Detective Inspector Hyatt: “Would you like to tell us who that person is, sir?”<br>
“That person is the president of the Russian Federation: Vladimir Putin,” Litvinenko replied.<br>
Thanks to a radioactive breadcrumb trail that led all the way back to Moscow, the manner in which he was murdered also became obvious in the end.<br>
As Litvinenko’s condition deteriorated, doctors decided to send a sample of his urine to the U.K. Atomic Weapons Establishment to see if they could detect any radioactivity. There, scientists discovered massive alpha radiation—the substance emitted by polonium-210, which would have been undetectable by medical staff, pathologists, or law enforcement.<br>
Once the nuclear scientists had discovered its presence, it was easy to retrace the steps of Lugovoy and Kovtun.</div></blockquote>

The answer almost certainly is yes. For the longest time a first tiny little hint was that Susan Kleinberg, a New York City-based artist who considers herself a "pal" of John Podesta, also announced a performance at Axel Vervoordt's Palazzo Fortuny in an email to Podesta.<br><br>
Then another hint popped up: Tony Podesta and wife Heather have maintained a summer home in Venice. Still a long shot, right? Then it turned out that the Podesta couple has been visiting this villa for more than a decade and up to a dozen times a year. Leading lobbyists as they are, they have hosted at least 20 members of congress here, including Ted Kennedy. [70] Still a long shot, right? Then it turned out that Tony and Heather Podesta never, or almost never, miss the Venice Biennale, the leading annual art show in the world in which much of Venice is transformed into an art circus. They extensively take part in the festivities. [71] According to Tony Podesta in 2013, "I've been coming [to Venice Biennale] for more than 25 years, so I guess that makes me a regular." [72] You know who else is a regular at Venice Biennale? Axel Vervoordt. In fact, he has been hosting the show annually at his Palazzo Fortuny, where he combines it with his own art show. [73] So, while there is no absolute proof, it appears Podesta and Vervoordt, both giants in the art world, know each other very well through Venice Biennale. Quite possibly their relationship goes back further than with their mutual friend Marina Abramovich.</div></blockquote>

Organised by the Axel &amp; May Vervoordt Foundation and the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia, the exhibition examines what role intuition plays in an artist’s creative process?</div></blockquote>

Since the early ’80s, Vervoordt has been combining objets d’art together in masterful ways at the Biennale des Antiquaires in Paris. In 2007 he also started curating exhibitions at Palazzo Fortuny as part of the Venice Biennale. And in 2008, the Axel &amp; May Vervoordt Foundation became a reality. A non-profit organization that emerged out of the exhibitions Axel curated in the past. The foundation is a way to set up exhibitions and preserve the objects’ integrity for the coming generations.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>
