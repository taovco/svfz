			<div class="content">Okay, this is quite a speculative post since I've been going down the Sicialian Mafia rabbithole thanks to a recent comment by @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2130" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">doginventer</a> on the post <em class="text-italics">Fire damages a summer camp Paul Newman founded for sick children....

I still have to complete that thread but finding certain items of information to do with healthcare turned my mind to healthcare tzar Bill Gates.  So, what are his connections to Sicily, if any?<br>

And the latest VIP to invest in these abandoned buildings is none other than Microsoft founder Bill Gates. He has recently purchased a house in Sicily and plans to buy several historic buildings to restructure and redirect them to social purposes. ..<br>
<br>
With the contributions and expertise of a great inventor like Gates, who is expected to arrive there in August, the city expects a rise in tourism and fast-paced infrastructure development.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Many “Very important persons” took part in the meeting<br>
<br>
It was held this year in Sicily, in the beautiful resort of <span style="color:#FF0040">Rocco Forte near Sciacca, Verdura</span>, the ultra-exclusive conference known as The Camp and organized by “Google”.<br>
<br>
The Camp meetings have as their object the discussion of topics of global significance such as feminism, <span style="color:#FF0040">the role of sport in modern culture</span> and other aspects of civil progress...<br>
<br>
This year at the conference, which was conducted by the chief of Google Business Omid Kordestani, were invited the CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, CEO snapchat Evan Spiegel, the Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington, the fashion designer Tory Burch, whose assets are estimated at one billion dollars and Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk, also present at the last edition.<br>
<br>
Among the guests names such as Bill Gates, Giorgio Armani, Jovanotti, Alicya Keys, David Bechkam, Queen Rania of Jordan, the brothers John and Lapo Elkann.<br>
<br>
Not a lot is known about the object of the conference. Certainly the guests, many of whom come to the Falcone and Borsellino airport by their private jets, have enjoyed the magnificent facilities of the Verdura Resort..<br>
<br>
The highlight was certainly the gala, which cost 100 thousand euro for the rent of the Valley of the Temples and 10,000 Euros for the ancient Borgo Bonsignore, where they were served aperitifs.

Charles Forte, Baron Forte <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Forte,_Baron_Forte" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F ... aron_Forte</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Charles Carmine Forte, Baron Forte /ˈfɔːrteɪ/ (26 November 1908 – 28 February 2007) was an Italian-born Scottish hotelier who founded the leisure and hotels conglomerate that ultimately became the Forte Group..<br>
<br>
Charles Forte was born as Carmine Forte in Mortale, now Monforte, Casalattico, in the province of Frosinone, Italy on 26 November 1908. He emigrated from Italy to Scotland at the age of four with his family.[3]<br>
<br>
He attended Alloa Academy and then St. Joseph's College, Dumfries as a boarder, followed by two years of studies in Rome..<br>
<br>
After Rome, Forte rejoined his family, who had moved to Weston-super-Mare, where his father ran a café with two cousins. Charles' main training at the age of 21 came in Brighton, where he managed the Venetian.<br>
<br>
At 26,<span style="color:#FF0040"> he set up his first "milk bar" in 1935, the Strand Milk Bar Ltd</span>.[4] Soon he began expanding into catering and hotel businesses. At the outbreak of World War II, Forte was interned in the Isle of Man due to his Italian nationality, but he was released after only three months.[4] After the war, his company became Forte Holdings Ltd and bought the Café Royal in 1954.<br>
<br>
In the 1950s, he also opened the first catering facility at Heathrow Airport and the first full motorway service station in the UK for cars at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on the M1 motorway in 1959. He purchased the Hungaria Restaurant in Lower Regent St. in 1955..<br>
<br>
Trust Houses Group Ltd and Forte Holdings were merged in 1970 to become Trust House Forte or THF. Through mergers and expansion, Forte expanded the Forte Group into a multibillion-pound business. His empire included the Little Chef and Happy Eater roadside restaurants, Crest, Forte Grand, Travelodge and Posthouse hotels, as well as the wine merchant Grierson-Blumenthal and a non-controlling majority stake in the <span style="color:#FF0040">Savoy Hotel</span>.<br>
<br>
Forte was the CEO from 1971 and chairman from 1982 (when his son Rocco took over as CEO) of the Group... Happy Eater and the five <span style="color:#FF0040">Welcome Break</span> major road service outlets were bought from Hanson Trust PLC on 1 August 1986. In the 1990s, the company increased its nominal capital and agreed to the public listed companies compliance regime to become Forte Group plc.<br>
<br>
Forte passed full control to his son Rocco in 1993, but soon the plc was faced with a hostile takeover bid from <span style="color:#FF0040">Granada</span>. Ultimately, Granada succeeded with a £3.9 billion tender offer in January 1996, which left the family with about £350 million in cash.<br>
<br>
On 28 February 2007, Forte died in his sleep at his home in London, aged 98.[3] He is buried in West Hampstead Cemetery.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Forte was knighted by The Queen Mother in 1970[5] and created a life peer on 2 February 1982 as Baron Forte, of Ripley in the County of Surrey.[6] He was also a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.</span><br>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Rocco Forte</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Forte" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Forte</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sir Rocco Giovanni Forte, FCA, FIoD (born 18 January 1945) is an English hotelier and the chairman of Rocco Forte Hotels.<br>
<br>
Forte took over from his father as CEO of the Forte Group in 1992. In the mid-1990s, the Forte Group was faced with a hostile takeover bid from Gerry Robinson's Granada..<br>
<br>
After the takeover, Forte set up his own chain of hotels in 1996, initially known as RF Hotels and re-branded as The Rocco Forte Collection after the return of the Forte brand name. He bought the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh and Brown's Hotel in London for £51.5m. As of April 2013, The Rocco Forte Collection operates eleven hotels in Europe, Russia, northern Africa and the Middle East...<br>
<br>
Forte was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1995 New Year Honours list for services to the UK tourism industry.[5] In March 2005, he received the highest Italian accolade, the Gran Croce dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana, for his entrepreneurial merits and strong links with Italy. He was President of the British Hospitality Association from 1991 to 1996.<br>
<br>
Philanthropy<br>
Forte funded a series of lectures at Westminster Cathedral in April 2008 organised by Cardinal Archbishop Cormac Murphy-O'Connor..<br>

Political activity<br>
<span style="color:#BF0040">Forte paid for a victory party for Boris Johnson in one of his hotels upon him winning the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election.[7] He donated £100,000 to the Conservative Party during the 2019 general election</span>..</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">Considerations on the Great Reset<br>
and the New World Order<br>
by Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò<br>
August 28, 2021<br>
Feast of St. Augustine</strong> <a href="https://insidethevatican.com/news/newsflash/letter-100-2021-tuesday-august-31-vigano/" class="postlink">https://insidethevatican.com/news/newsf ... 31-vigano/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Excerpts:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">No one will be part of the New World Order<br>
unless he carries out an act of worship to Lucifer.<br>
No one will enter the New Age unless he receives Luciferian initiation.</em><br>
                 —David Spangler, Director of the United Nations Planetary Initiative Project (Reflections on The Christ, Findhorn, 1978) <br>
<br>
For more than a year and a half we have been helplessly witnessing the succession of incongruent events to which most of us are unable to give a plausible justification.<br>
<br>
    The pandemic emergency has made particularly evident the contradictions and illogicalities of measures nominally intended to limit contagion – lockdowns, curfews, closures of commercial activities, limitations of public services and classes, suspension of citizens’ rights – but which are disavowed daily by conflicting voices, by clear evidence of ineffectiveness, by contradictions on the part of the same health authorities...<br>
<br>
From science to scientism<br>
<br>
    The art of medicine — which is not science, but the application of scientific principles to different cases each time, on an experiential and experimental basis — seems to have renounced its prudence, in the name of an emergency that has risen to the level of priesthood of a religion — the religion of science, in fact — which in order to be such has cloaked itself in a dogmatism bordering on superstition.<br>
<br>
The <em class="text-italics">ministers</em> of this <em class="text-italics">cult</em> have constituted themselves as a caste of untouchables, exempt from any criticism even when their claims are denied by the evidence of the facts...<br>
<br>
As I said earlier, we are faced with a colossal deception, based on lies and fraud.<br>
<br>
    This deception starts from the premise that the justifications put forward by the authorities in support of their actions are sincere...<br>
<br>
The accusation of “conspiracy theory” could perhaps have made sense when the conspiracy was not yet evident, but today denying what the elite has planned since the 1950s is unjustifiable.<br>
<br>
    There should be no surprise at the Holy See’s support for vaccines: in June 2011 the Sovereign Independent carried the headline on its front page: “Depopulation Through Forced Vaccination: The Zero Carbon Solution!”(here).<br>
<br>
    Beside the headline, a photograph of Bill Gates was accompanied by a quote from him: “The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive services [abortion and contraception], we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.”<br>
<br>
    This is what Bill Gates said eleven years ago.<br>
<br>
    Today he is one of the shareholders of the Black Rock group that finances the pharmaceutical companies that produce the vaccines, one of the main sponsors of the World Health Organization (WHO), and also of a myriad of public and private entities connected to health...<br>
<br>
 At his side we curiously find George Soros, the “philanthropist” of the Open Society, which together with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently invested in a British company that produces swabs for Covid testing (here).<br>
<br>
    And since we are talking about economic issues, I would like to recall that the Holy See has held shares worth about €20 million in two pharmaceutical companies that have produced a contraceptive drug (here), and more recently it invested in a fund that guaranteed very high profits in the event of a geopolitical or pandemic crisis thanks to speculation on international currencies, the “Geo-Risk” fund managed by the Merrill Lynch investment bank, which had to close it because of its skyrocketing yields after the first few months of the pandemic (here).<br>
<br>
    Other capital, coming from the “Peter’s Pence” collection, had been used to finance various other initiatives, even collaborating with [Italian businessman] <span style="color:#FF0040">Lapo Elkann</span>, whose endeavors include Rocketman, the autobiographical film of Elton John.<br>
<br>
To say nothing of the real estate speculations and the purchase of the London building at 60 Sloane Avenue that the news coverage has amply informed us on, a purchase that I know, from a reliable source, was decided on by Bergoglio himself.<br>
<br>
    And then there’s China: always in the name of “coherence” and the “church of the poor for the poor” that is so dear to Bergoglio’s heart, there are those who believe that the secret Accord prepared by the Jesuits and former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick may have obtained substantial funding from the communist regime in Beijing in exchange for the Vatican’s silence over the persecution of Catholics and the violation of human rights (here).<br>
<br>
We cannot forget the emails of John Podesta and Hillary Clinton, which show the intention to oust Benedict XVI from the papacy and so to initiate a new “springtime of the Church” that would be progressivist and globalist, which later came about with the resignation of Benedict and the election of the Argentine.<br>
<br>
    Nor can we overlook the interference of entities and institutions that are anything but close to religion, such as the B’nai B’rith, in dictating the direction of the “renewal” of the Church after Vatican II and most of all under this Pontificate.<br>
<br>
    Finally, we should remember on the one hand the disdainful refusals to grant audiences to conservative political and institutional personalities, and on the other hand the passionate smiling encounters with leaders of the Left and of progressivism, along with expressions of enthusiastic satisfaction on the occasion of their election...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The Luciferian matrix of the New World Order<br>
</span><br>
<br>
..In order to understand the esoteric roots of the thought that lies at the foundation of the United Nations, once longed for by [19th-century Italian political activist] Giuseppe Mazzini, we cannot fail to consider characters such as Albert Pike, Eliphas Levi, Helena Blavatsky, Alice Ann Bailey, or other disciples of Luciferian sects.<br>
<br>
Their writings, published since the late nineteenth century, are quite revealing.<br>
<br>
    Albert Pike, a friend of Mazzini and a fellow Freemason, gave an address in 1889 in France to the highest levels of Freemasonry, which was then reprinted on 19 January 1935 by the English journal The Freemason. Pike declared:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">That which we must say to the crowd is, we worship a god, but it is the god one adores without superstition […]. The Masonic religion ought to be maintained in the purity of Luciferian doctrine by all of us who are initiates of the highest degrees. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay [sic] [the God of the Christians] whose deeds prove his cruelty, perfidy and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion of science, would Adonay and his priest calumniate him?<br>
<br>
    Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also God. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods: darkness being necessary to light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive… the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.<br>
</em><br>
<br>
    This profession of faith in the divinity of Satan is not only an admission of who the real Great Architect that Freemasonry adores is, but also a blasphemous political project that passed through the ecumenism of Vatican II, whose first theorist was Freemasonry..

Police investigated him at the time for cocaine use and soliciting prostitution.[13] The Italian photographer Fabrizio Corona attempted to blackmail the Agnelli family for compromising information against Lapo Elkann. Marco Durante, head of LaPresse, an international photographic agency, was hired by the Agnelli family to negotiate with Fabrizio Corona and manage the situation.<br>
<br>
On November 27, 2016 in New York, Elkann was arrested for making a false police report claiming that he had been unlawfully imprisoned.[16] He had previously contacted his family, stating that he would "be harmed" if they did not pay a $10,000 ransom. He was accompanied by a transsexual escort who was also arrested.. Charges against the escort and against Elkann were later dropped.<br>
