			<div class="content">Yesterday Haiti had another earthquake.  Even larger than the devastating one from 2010.  Yesterday was also the anniversary of the anniversary of the Bois Caiman Ceremony that took place on Aug. 14th 1791 <a href="https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed/status/1426583879108890632" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed/status ... 9108890632</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Haitian Revolution begins with the Bois Caïman ceremony.  Ready to carry out their plans, the slaves meet in Morne-Rouge to make final preparations and to give instructions. The slaves decide that “Upon a given signal, the plantations would be systematically set aflame, and a generalized slave insurrection set afoot.” Rumors circulate that white masters and colonial authorities are on their way to France to fight the Crown’s recent decrees granting mulattoes and free blacks rights. Though false, these rumors “served as a rallying point around which to galvanize the aspirations of the slaves, to solidify and channel these into open rebellion.”<br>
<br>
The Bois Caïman ceremony and subsequent insurrections are the result of months of planning and strategizing. There are two hundred slave leaders involved from around the North.  All hold privileged positions on their plantations, most of them commandeurs with influence and authority over other slaves.Through strategic maneuvering these leaders successfully unite a vast network of Africans, mulattoes, maroons, commandeurs, house slaves, field slaves, and free blacks.<br>
<br>
The Bois Caïman ceremony takes place in a thickly wooded area where <span style="color:#FF0040">the slaves solemnize their pact in a voodoo ritual.</span> The ceremony is officiated by Boukman,  a maroon leader and voodoo priest from Jamaica, and a voodoo high priestess. Various accounts from that night describe a tempestuous storm, animal sacrifices, and voodoo deities. However, over the centuries the ceremony has become legendary, and it is important to note it can be difficult to distill fact from myth.

Coincidence?  Or a helping hand from HAARP?<br>

In that video Dr. Nick Begich explains how he thinks HAARP can cause earthquakes using ELFs.<br>
<br>
Begich is the son of Nick Begich Sr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Begich" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Begich</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Nicholas Joseph Begich Sr.[1][2] (April 6, 1932 – disappeared October 16, 1972) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Alaska. He is presumed to have died in the crash of a light aircraft in Alaska in 1972; his body was never found...<br>
<br>
Begich worked as a guidance counselor in the schools of Anchorage, and he was later Director of Student Personnel for the Anchorage school system before becoming Superintendent of Schools at Fort Richardson.[6][7] In 1962, Begich was elected to the Alaska Senate, where he served for eight years. Begich also taught political science during parts of this period at the University of Alaska at Anchorage..<br>
<br>
On October 16, 1972, he and House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, of Louisiana, were two of the four men on board a twin engine Cessna 310 when the airplane disappeared during a flight from Anchorage to Juneau. Also on board were Begich's aide, Russell Brown, and the pilot, Don Jonz.[10] The four were heading to a campaign fundraiser for Begich..<br>
<br>
The Cessna was required to carry an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) per Alaska state statutes section 02.35.115, Downed Aircraft Transmitting Devices, which took effect on September 6, 1972,[12] five weeks before the plane disappeared. The Alaska statute made reference to Federal Aviation Regulation 91.52, published on September 21, 1971, which mandated ELTs in aircraft such as this, but had an effective date of December 30, 1973, for existing aircraft..<br>
<br>
No ELT signal determined to be from the plane was heard during the search. In its report on the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the pilot's portable ELT, permissible in lieu of a fixed ELT on the plane, was found in an aircraft at Fairbanks, Alaska. The report also notes that a witness saw an unidentified object in the pilot's briefcase that resembled, except for color, the portable ELT. The NTSB concluded that neither the pilot nor aircraft had an ELT.[16]<br>
<br>
In 1972, the tallest building in Whittier, Alaska, was renamed to Begich Towers in memory of Nick Begich. Begich Peak which is three miles north of the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center at Portage Lake is also named for him..<br>
<br>
In November 2015, a Seattle Weekly story detailed the work of journalist Jonathan Walczak, who since 2012 has investigated the plane crash and subsequent events in an effort to determine the fate of the flight that carried Begich and Boggs.[18] Walczak created a podcast about Begich's disappearance, which was released by iHeartMedia in the summer of 2020. The podcast, called Missing in Alaska, explored the idea that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover or the Tucson mafia had assassinated Hale Boggs...<br>
<br>
Nick Begich had six children: Mark, Nichelle, Tom, Stephanie, Paul, and Nick Jr.<br>
<br>
His son Mark Begich was elected as a member of the Anchorage Borough Assembly, then became Mayor, and was narrowly elected as the junior U.S. Senator from Alaska. ..<br>
<br>
Nick Begich's widow, Peggie, would briefly marry a <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="color:#FF0040">known mafia hitman named Jerry Max Paisley</span></span>, whom she had been secretly dating on the side even before the disappearance, and who ended up going to prison in 1994 for murder.[23] Pegge Begich ran for the House of Representatives seat in 1984 and 1986, but she was defeated by the incumbent, Don Young. She later retired and lived in Nevada.

Circa 5 mins. into the video there is a nice demonstration on a piano explaining the use of ELFs on the different earth strata... It put me in mind of a Thomas Sheridan video where he talks about feeling unwell and uneasy on the 13th August.. <a href="https://youtu.be/x4DP-q15jvM" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/x4DP-q15jvM</a><br>
<br>
<br>
I'll continue with the HAARP musings later.</div>

2009 article:<br>
<br>
Strange New Air Force Facility Energizes Ionosphere, Fans Conspiracy Flames <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/07/mf-haarp/" class="postlink">https://www.wired.com/2009/07/mf-haarp/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>by Noah Shachtman<br>
<br>
The shocking thing about Haarp isn't that it's a boondoggle (it's actually pretty worthwhile) or that it was spawned by a military-industrial-petrochemical-political complex (a hallowed government tradition). It's that, all too often, this is the way big science gets done in the US...<br>
<br>
TODD PEDERSEN HAD to hustle—the sky was scheduled to start glowing soon, and he didn't want to miss it. It was just before sunset, a cold February evening in deep-woods Alaska, and the broad-shouldered US Air Force physicist was scrambling across the snow in his orange down parka and fur-lined bomber hat. Grabbing cables and electronics, he rushed to assemble a jury-rigged telescope atop a crude wooden platform...<br>
<br>
In 1901, Guglielmo Marconi received a simple radio signal sent from across the Atlantic Ocean—dot-dot-dot, again and again, the letter S repeated in Morse code. Leading scientists of the day had said such a transmission was impossible: Earth's surface is curved, and radio waves travel in straight lines. The dots should have shot out into space. Instead, they traveled from Cornwall, England, to a 500-foot antenna Marconi hung from a kite in Newfoundland. A previously unknown, electromagnetically charged layer of the atmosphere was reflecting the signal back down to earth...<br>
<br>
At any given moment, the sun is bombarding our planet with 170 billion megawatts of ultraviolet, x-ray, and other radiation. Those waves collide with atoms of air—nitrogen, oxygen, and so on—stripping away electrons like spring rain eroding a snowbank. The result: positively charged ions drifting free. At high altitudes, those ions are far enough apart that it can take hours for them to bind with a free electron. Called the ionosphere, these undulating bands of charged particles stretch from 50 to 500 miles above the earth—too high for weather balloons and, in large part, too low for satellites. Researchers who study it jokingly call it the ignorosphere...<br>
<br>
But by the 1980s, US atmospheric radio science had dead-ended. "We had become a very small field, and we wanted to try to revive it," says Konstant Papadopoulos, a plasma and space physicist at the University of Maryland. "We needed a modern facility."...<br>
<br>
One of the first ideas came mid-decade from Bernard Eastlund, a physicist working for oil-and-gas conglomerate Atlantic Richfield. Arco had the rights to trillions of cubic feet of natural gas under Alaska's North Slope. The problem had always been how to get that gas to the port at Valdez. Eastlund had a better idea: Use the gas onsite to fuel a giant ionospheric heater. Such a facility, he wrote in a series of patents, could fry Soviet missiles in midflight or maybe even nudge cyclones and other extreme weather toward enemies. <span style="color:#FF0040">That's right: weaponized hurricanes.</span><br>
<br>
Arco's executives presented the idea to Simon Ramo, one of the godfathers of the US intercontinental ballistic missile program. Ramo passed it on to the under secretary of defense, who in turn gave it to the Pentagon's advanced research arm, Darpa, and the DOD's secretive science advisory board, code-named Jason. Tony Tether, director of Darpa's strategic technology office, gave Arco a contract to conduct a feasibility study. Arco brought on board none other than Dennis Papadopoulos as a consultant.<br>
<br>
Papadopoulos wasn't very impressed. Eastlund's tricks wouldn't work even if the site were in the right place along Earth's magnetic field—which it wasn't. But the ad hoc coalition of radio scientists did like the idea of setting up a new heater in Alaska. In those upper latitudes, the ionosphere intersects with Earth's magnetic field and becomes scientifically interesting.<br>
<br>
Luckily, the senior senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens, enjoyed a reputation for inserting projects into the federal budget to benefit his home state, most notoriously a $223 million bridge from the town of Ketchikan to, well, not much of anyplace. In 1988, the researchers sat down with Stevens and assured him that an ionospheric heater would be a bona fide scientific marvel and a guaranteed job creator, and it could be built for a mere $30 million. "He provided some congressional money, some pork money," Papadopoulos says. "It was much less than the bridge to nowhere." Just like that, the Pentagon had $10 million for ionospheric heater research.<br>
<br>
Now the scientists had some startup cash, but they also needed hardware—and for that, they had to enlist the military. In a series of meetings in the winter of 1989-90, the field's leading lights, including Papadopoulos, pitched the Navy and the Air Force. Haarp, they asserted, could lead to "significant operational capabilities." They'd build a giant phased antenna array that would aim a finely tuned beam of high- frequency radio waves into the sky. The beam would excite electrons in the ionosphere, altering that spot's conductivity and inducing it to emit its own extremely low frequency waves, which could theoretically penetrate the earth's surface to reveal hidden bunkers or be used to <span style="color:#FF0040">contact deeply submerged submarines</span>.<br>
<br>
That last app caught the military's attention. Communicating with subs thousands of miles away, under thousands of feet of ocean, requires ultralow frequencies, and that requires whomping-big antennas. To do it, the Navy had built an array in the upper Midwest that transmits its signal through bedrock, but its construction required razing 84 miles' worth of hundred-foot-wide path through wilderness, including a national forest. It drove local environmentalists crazy. But who would protest an ephemeral antenna in the sky?<br>
<br>
Of course, the scientists said, you'd need a brand-new, state-of-the-art ionospheric heater to see if any of this was even feasible. The Pentagon somewhat reluctantly went for it—and began using Stevens' earmarked cash to fund the appropriate studies.<br>
<br>
..For more than a year, planning proceeded largely out of public view. Then, in 1993, an Anchorage teachers' union rep named <span style="color:#FF0040">Nick Begich</span>—son of one of Alaska's most important political families—found a notice about Haarp in the Australian conspiracy magazine Nexus.<br>
<br>
When Begich was 13, a Cessna carrying his father, a Congressional representative, disappeared. Neither the plane nor its passengers were ever recovered. Over the years, Begich became obsessed with uncovering mysteries. Between gigs as a gemologist, miner, school supervisor, and Chickaloon tribal administrator, he regularly lectured on government mind-control technology. So you can imagine his reaction when he began looking into Haarp: the weather-control patents, the Pentagon proposals for long-range spying, the oil company schemes. Senator Stevens had even suggested that the ionosphere could end our dependency on fossil fuels. "At any time over Fairbanks," Stevens said on the Senate floor, "there is more energy than there is in the entire United States." Begich had hit the conspiracy jackpot...<br>
<br>
Begich told his audiences that Haarp was a high-powered weapon prototype. Forget spying underground with low-frequency waves—Haarp was so strong it could trigger earthquakes. And by dumping all those radio waves into the ionosphere, Haarp could turn a miles-wide portion of the upper atmosphere into a giant lens. "The result will be an absolutely catastrophic release of pure energy," he wrote. "The sky would literally appear to burn."<br>
<br>
The military's response only amped up the conspiracists. When program managers swore that the facility would "never be used for military functions," Begich would trot out military reports touting satellite-blinding research plans or then-secretary of defense William Cohen's suggestion that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306115727/https://fas.org/news/usa/1997/04/bmd970429d.htm" class="postlink"> "electromagnetic waves"</a> could alter the climate and control earthquakes and volcanoes remotely.....<br>
<br>
Haarp's Mission<br>
<br>
The heart of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program is an ionospheric heater that shoots electromagnetic energy into Earth's atmosphere. Five generators pump out 2.9 megawatts each; 180 antennas convert the electricity into high-frequency radio waves and send them into the ionosphere, which turns them into low-frequency waves. Why? Research. An energized ionosphere could be used for all sorts of cool stuff.<br>
<br>
Communication<br>
Haarp can bounce signals off the ionosphere with wavelengths long enough to penetrate deep into the ocean and communicate with submarines.<br>
<br>
Protection<br>
Researchers are testing whether ionospheric waves could nudge H-bomb-generated electrons out of the magnetosphere, shielding orbiting satellites.<br>
<br>
Atmospheric Research<br>
At about 125 miles up, Haarp's waves can energize free electrons, which collide with neutral atoms to produce a glow like the aurora borealis.<br>
<br>
Surveillance<br>
How low-frequency waves are absorbed and reflected by the earth can reveal what's underneath—including hidden bunkers.<br>
<br>
Of course, the facility would need 180 antennas and a lot more money. But as the panel was winding down in 2001, cash stopped being a problem. <span style="color:#FF0040">Tether became head of Darpa, taking charge of nearly $2 billion a year for research. He put together a deal for the Air Force, Navy, and his agency to fund Haarp's construction</span>—with some congressional pork, of course. Again, Arco's construction subsidiary (by then renamed and sold to giant defense contractor BAE Systems) was selected to handle most of the hardware, a $35.4 million job that would balloon to $118.5 million. And Papadopoulos still had his separate military funding for ionospheric heating research. In a field as small as radio science, it's almost impossible to avoid such overlap. By 2007, Haarp was running at full strength. But it was still mysterious. Neither the public nor the press had been allowed inside since the array became fully operational....<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, for one day only, the military will grant the public access to Haarp for the first time since 2007. Today, I'm getting a sneak peek. I say my name into a call box... Ionospheric papers are back in the scientific literature. Even the space-based nuclear clean-up experiments are teaching us lessons about the Van Allen radiation belts. Online, the tinfoil-hatted chatter about Haarp drones on—it's blamed for everything from Katrina to last year's earthquake in Sichuan, China. But after decades of pushing, radio scientists finally have the experimental facility of their dreams...<br>
<br>
Yet Haarp's future is unclear. Defense budgets are shrinking, and the facility costs $10 million a year to operate. Haarp's patron at Darpa, Tony Tether, has left his job. The project's godfather, Ted Stevens, was defeated in the 2008 Senate election by the mayor of Anchorage: Mark Begich, Nick's little brother. "I'll have his ear," Nick promises.<br>
<br>
So the radio scientists may have to look for funding again, which probably means a whole new set of rationales. You can imagine how the conspiracy crowd will react. And the scientists, in their eagerness, can end up feeding the paranoia. Papadopoulos, for example, says he wants to do another round of subterranean surveillance experiments. "Personally, I believe it can reach 1,000 kilometers. It can't reach Iran, if that's your question," he laughs. "But if I put Haarp on a ship, or on an oil platform, who knows?" Not that he has concrete plans for such tests in Alaska, let alone in the Persian Gulf—though he does mention a facility in Puerto Rico as a possibility.<br>
<br>
But he has already said enough. Papadopoulos just wants to do science. But for suspicious minds, the implications are there: With just a bit more funding, a few more experiments, Haarp can still be a place haunted by sinister agencies with three-letter initials and spectral lights that appear in the sky and then vanish without a trace.

			<div class="content">COHEN ADDRESS 4/28 AT CONFERENCE ON TERRORISM<br>
Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy<br>
Sam Nunn Policy Forum<br>
April 28, 1997 University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306115727/https://fas.org/news/usa/1997/04/bmd970429d.htm" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20160306115 ... 70429d.htm</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SECRETARY COHEN: <br>
Senator Nunn, thank you very much. As Senator Nunn<br>
has indicated, he and I have worked for many years together, along<br>
with Senator Lugar. The two of these gentlemen I feel are perhaps the<br>
most courageous and visionary to have served in the Senate. They were<br>
largely responsible, of course, for adopting the so-called Nunn/Lugar<br>
legislation.<br>
<br>
I'll comment on that later during the course of the morning, but I've<br>
had occasion to meet with a number of Russian counterparts, and as we<br>
go through various translations of the communications that we're<br>
having, the two words they are able to articulate very clearly, they<br>
say "Nunn/Lugar, Nunn/Lugar." So they know exactly what that means,<br>
and that means the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act that these two<br>
gentlemen were indispensable in shepherding through the United States<br>
Congress.<br>
<br>
It was Nunn/Lugar I that dealt with the reduction of nuclear weapons<br>
between the United States and the Soviet Union in terms of trying to<br>
come to grips with how we helped the Russians dismantle hundreds of<br>
their nuclear weapons, and also helped them with their destruction of<br>
chemical weapons. But they, of course, have looked beyond simply that<br>
particular relationship, which is very important, but also looking to<br>
the future that we face as far as the rise of terrorism -- both<br>
international and domestic -- and finding ways in which the Department<br>
of Defense can become involved in helping local states and local<br>
agencies to deal with the threat of terrorism which is quite likely to<br>
increase in the coming years.<br>
<br>
It's a pleasure for me to be here. Both Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar<br>
are close friends, and I look forward to, I think, a very productive<br>
seminar. Once again demonstrating that although Senator Nunn has left<br>
public service in the Senate, he has not left public service as far as<br>
the nation is concerned.<br>
<br>
SENATOR NUNN: Thank you very much, Bill.<br>
<br>
...Let me ask if there are any questions for Secretary of Defense<br>
Cohen.<br>
<br>
Q: The dual containment policy in Iran and Iraq, do you think that's<br>
conducive to regional stability in that region? And do you think (it)<br>
can cause further terrorism in the United States? That type of<br>
containment policy in the Middle East.<br>
<br>
A: I think Secretary Albright articulated our policy as far as dealing<br>
with Iraq, that it's clear that we have been unable to strike any kind<br>
of a productive relationship with Saddam Hussein, and as soon as<br>
Saddam Hussein is no longer the head of that government, that there's<br>
(a) new regime that follows him, that we will look forward to finding<br>
ways in which we could engage them in a much more productive fashion,<br>
particularly after they comply with all of the UN sanctions. There's<br>
an eagerness on our part to do that. But I think as long as he remains<br>
in office as the head of that state, it's unlikely that we could have<br>
anything but the current policy in place, with very little prospects<br>
for relief....<br>
<br>
Q: What does it mean that Clinton (inaudible) proliferation?<br>
<br>
A: To the extent that we see the level of communication available<br>
today, the Internet and other types of interwoven communicative skills<br>
and abilities, we're going to see information continue to spread as to<br>
how these weapons can be, in fact, manufactured in a home-grown<br>
laboratory, as such. So it's a serious problem as far as living in the<br>
Information Age that people who are acquiring this kind of information<br>
will not act responsibly, but rather act in a terrorist type of<br>
fashion.<br>
<br>
We've seen by way of example of the World Trade Center the<br>
international aspects of international terrorism coming to our home<br>
territory. We've also seen domestic terrorism with the Oklahoma<br>
bombing. So it's a real threat that's here today. It's likely to<br>
intensify in the years to come as more and more groups have access to<br>
this kind of information and the ability to produce them.<br>
<br>
Q: How prepared is the U.S. Government to deal with (inaudible)?<br>
<br>
A: I think we have to really intensify our efforts. That's the reason<br>
for the Nunn/Lugar II program. That's the reason why it's a local<br>
responsibility, as such, but the Department of Defense is going to be<br>
taking the lead as far as supervising the interagency working groups,<br>
and to make the assessments as to what needs to be done. So we're<br>
going to identify those 120 cities and work with them very closely to<br>
make sure that they can prepare themselves for what is likely to be a<br>
threat well into the future.<br>
<br>
Q: Let me ask you specifically about last week's scare here in<br>
Washington, and what we might have learned from how prepared we are to<br>
deal with that (inaudible), at B'nai Brith.<br>
<br>
A: Well, it points out the nature of the threat. It turned out to be a<br>
false threat under the circumstances. But as we've learned in the<br>
intelligence community, we had something called -- and we have James<br>
Woolsey here to perhaps even address this question about phantom<br>
moles. The mere fear that there is a mole within an agency can set off<br>
a chain reaction and a hunt for that particular mole which can<br>
paralyze the agency for weeks and months and years even, in a search.<br>
The same thing is true about just the false scare of a threat of using<br>
some kind of a chemical weapon or a biological one. There are some<br>
reports, for example, that some countries have been trying to<br>
construct something like an Ebola Virus, and that would be a very<br>
dangerous phenomenon, to say the least. Alvin Toeffler has written<br>
about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to<br>
devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic-specific so<br>
that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races; and<br>
others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects<br>
that can destroy specific crops. <span style="color:#FF0040">Others are engaging even in an<br>
eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off<br>
earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic<br>
waves.</span><br>
<br>
So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work<br>
finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations. It's<br>
real, and that's the reason why we have to intensify our efforts, and<br>
that's why this is so important.

			<div class="content">Author of that 2009 WIRED article on HAARP - Noah Shachtman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Shachtman" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Shachtman</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Noah Shachtman is an American journalist. He is the incoming editor of Rolling Stone.[1] From 2018 to 2021, he served as the Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Beast.[2] He previously was the Executive Editor of the site.[3] A former non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, he also worked as Executive Editor for News at Foreign Policy and as a contributing editor at Wired.<br>
<br>
Born to a Jewish family, Shachtman graduated from Georgetown University and attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem<br>
<br>
In 2003, Shachtman founded Defensetech.org, the site was acquired by Military.com the following year.[7]<br>
<br>
In 2006, he became a contributing editor at Wired. He co-founded the Danger Room blog, which he won the 2007 Online Journalism Award for Beat Reporting[8] and the 2012 National Magazine Award for reporting in digital media. During his tenure at Wired, he patrolled with Marines in the heart of <span style="color:#FF0040">Afghanistan's opium country</span>,[9] embedded with a Baghdad bomb squad,[10] pored over the biggest investigation in FBI history,[11] exposed technical glitches in the U.S. drone program,[12] snuck into the <span style="color:#FF0040">Los Alamos nuclear lab</span>,[13] profiled Russia's best-known cybersecurity mogul,[14] revealed what was then the biggest hack of U.S. military systems ever,[15] and underwent experiments by Pentagon-funded scientists at <span style="color:#FF0040">Stanford</span>.<br>
<br>
[<em class="text-italics">some of that Epstein hunting ground... just saying</em>]<br>
<br>
Shachtman left Wired to go to Foreign Policy in 2013. He joined The Daily Beast as its new executive editor in 2014.[17] He helped turned the site into "a journalistic scoop factory," in the words of the Poynter Institute,[18] uncovering sexual assault allegations against actor T.J. Miller[19] and adult film performer Ron Jeremy,[20] and revealing the Church of Scientology's attempts to silence the rape accusers of actor Danny Masterson.[21] Shachtman led the site's coverage of Russia's attempts to destabilize the 2016 U.S. election, demonstrating how Russian intelligence operatives organized rallies on U.S. soil[22] and exposing how Russian "activist" Maria Butina infiltrated the U.S. conservative movement.[23] Butina was later arrested and pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to act as a foreign agent.[24] The Senate Intelligence Committee repeatedly cited The Daily Beast's work in its subsequent investigations into the matter[25] and Special Counsel Robert Mueller later indicted a series of Russian companies and individuals whose activities were first revealed by the site.<br>
<br>
When John Avlon left in May 2018, he was promoted to editor-in-chief.[27] During Shachtman's tenure, <span style="color:#FF0040">The Daily Beast broke the news of Jeffrey Epstein's arrest[28] and revealed his secret charity.[29] The site flagged the unnamed $325,000 donation to a pro-Trump PAC that eventually led to the arrest of Rudy Giuliani associates Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas for campaign finance violations.[30] The site's reporting was subsequently cited by the House Judiciary Committee in both its first[31] and second[32] articles of impeachment against Donald Trump.</span>..<br>
<br>
In April 2021, The Daily Beast uncovered the evidence that Rep. Matt Gaetz had paid a convicted sex trafficker[36] to have intercourse with multiple women and a 17-year-old girl.[37] The site's story on the McDonald's Monopoly scam became the basis for an HBO documentary and a forthcoming feature film produced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.[38] The Daily Beast's exposes of star New York Times reporters Donald McNeil and David Barstow led to the Pulitzer Prize-winners leaving the paper.[39][40] “We’re not afraid to take a side, [we aren’t] afraid to throw a punch. To me, that’s old school, scrappy, and street-smart tabloid. That’s the only journalism that I know how to do and that works in this age,” he told Digiday.[41] “Fuck access journalism," he said in an interview with Recode.[6] "Frankly, who’s gonna spoon-feed The Daily Beast? Like, they all know we’re a bunch of velociraptors around here. We’re just gonna bite the hand off if you spoon-feed us." The Hollywood Reporter named Shachtman one of the most powerful people in New York media[42] in 2019.<br>
<br>
Shachtman was named Editor-in-Chief of Rolling Stone in July 2021. “Rolling Stone changed my life. Its music journalism helped push me to play in bands for real. Its conflict reporting gave me a north star to aim for when I was a national security reporter,” Shachtman told the New York Post. “Its gonzo political journalism inspired me as an editor.”..<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">Prior to his career in journalism, Shachtman was a campaign staffer in the Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign</span>, a book editor, and professional bass player,[57] touring and recording with the Stubborn-All Stars, Subatomic Sound System, and many others.</div></blockquote>

Interesting career trajectory.<br>
