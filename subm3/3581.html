<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A phalanx of billionaires are backing a new mining initiative in Greenland, in what they hope will boost access to minerals used to manufacture electric cars. It’s significant news in a country that has not always celebrated natural resource exploration. And it has some environmental scientists concerned.<br>
<br>
The source of the billionaire money is an initiative founded by <span style="color:#FF0040">Bill Gates, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, whose investors include Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Jack Ma, Ray Dalio, and Michael Bloomberg</span>. Gates founded Breakthrough Energy in 2015 as a vehicle for combating climate change, and it has raised $2 billion to date, including a $1 billion funding round completed earlier this year. The organization has invested in dozens of startups in the <span style="color:#FF0040">sustainable energy space</span>.<br>
<br>
The Greenland project is a joint venture between a publicly traded British firm, Bluejay Mining, and KoBold Metals, an American company that is paying $15 million for a majority stake in the operation. Breakthrough Energy is one of KoBold’s principal investors; the venture capital mega-firm <span style="color:#FF0040">Andreessen Horowitz is also a backer</span>.<br>
<br>
..Amnesty International has documented cases of human rights violations in overseas mine facilities used by <span style="color:#FF0040">battery companies</span>, including use of child workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<br>
<br>
“The glamourous shop displays and marketing of state of the art technologies are a stark contrast to the children carrying bags of rocks, and miners in narrow manmade tunnels risking permanent lung damage,” said Mark Dummett, a researcher at Amnesty International, in a 2016 report.

There are a number of issues in that article.  First, I just want to mention the coincidence of the company called BREAKTHROUGH Energy and the COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html" class="postlink">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/h ... cases.html</a><br>
<br>
Apart from Bill Gates, I hope that this post will start to connect some dots between what is currently happening in the healthcare sector and the transformation of the Energy sector...<br>
<br>
Now remember some of our previous posts about batteries? Like..<br>
<br>
<a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2437654/12129150" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2437654/12129150</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Melanie Loveridge is a materials chemist with a proven background in new materials development and characterisation in the disciplines of energy storage systems (batteries) and corrosion inhibition in coated metal systems. She completed an Engineering Doctorate sponsored by Akzo Nobel &amp; Tata: An in-situ Scanning Kelvin Probe Applied to Mechanisms of Corrosion-driven Coating delamination in Organic Coated Steels (2004).<br>
<br>
Since I've got melanin on the mind due to a previous post, I thought I'd look into any connections with melanin in this area of research and of course, there is.<br>
<br>
Melanie has been involved with successful funding applications for EPSRC and TSB grants and collaborated in projects with top UK research groups. A significant time spent within industry (including a university spin-out company) has given her experience of being a specialist, leading teams and generating journal publications and inventions in international patents. Her research background is multi-disciplinary enabling cross-pollination and successes in taking concepts to material realities.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Your body may use it to catch a tan, but now the skin pigment melanin has been repurposed for the first time to make batteries. These may one day offer a safer way to power electronic devices that can be swallowed or inserted into the human body for drug delivery or internal monitoring.<br>
<br>
Rechargeable <span style="color:#FF0040">lithium-ion batteries</span> are widely used in electronics because they are very efficient and can hold their charge for long periods. But because they contain lithium, these batteries are potentially toxic if used long-term inside the body. So Christopher Bettinger at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, wanted to find a way to build batteries from biological materials.</div></blockquote>

“You Gotta Believe” was written on the day the twin towers fell in 2001, was performed by Parvati at Madison Square Gardens, and is an expression of Parvati’s heartfelt belief in the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity.<br>
<br>
The footage in this video was shot as part of the northernmost musical performance ever, when Parvati travelled to the North Pole to raise awareness of the melting polar ice. Additional footage is from Resolute Bay, Nunavut.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem, also known as the Leper Brothers of Jerusalem or simply as Lazarists, was a Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem, Kingdom of Jerusalem, whose care became its original purpose, named after its patron saint, Lazarus.[1][2][3] It was recognised by King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142 and canonically recognised as a hospitaller and military order of chivalry under the rule of Saint Augustine in the Papal bull Cum a Nobis Petitur of Pope Alexander IV in 1255. Although they were centred on their charism of caring for those afflicted with leprosy, the knights of the Order of Saint Lazarus notably fought in the Battle of La Forbie in 1244 and in the Defense of Acre in 1291.[4] The titular seat was successively situated at Jerusalem, Saint-Jean-d'Acre and - after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem - split in two main branches in Italy and in Château Royal de Boigny-sur-Bionne in France..<br>
<br>
In 1489, Pope Innocent VIII attempted to merge the order and its land holdings with the Knights Hospitaller. This was resisted by the larger part of the jurisdictions of the Order of Saint Lazarus including those in France, Southern Italy, Hungary, Switzerland, and England. The Knights Hospitaller only managed to appropriate the Lazarus holdings in Germany.<br>
<br>
In 1572, the Order of Saint Lazarus in Italy was merged with the Order of Saint Maurice under the <span style="color:#FF0040">Royal House of Savoy</span> to form the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, which still exists until today, widely recognised as a dynastic successor of the Italian branch.</div></blockquote>

Hmm.. about the pedophile Cardinal Pell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228160504/http://st-lazarus.org.au/pdf/CARDINAL%20GEORGE%20PELL%20bio.pdf" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20150228160 ... %20bio.pdf</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Cardinal Pell joined the Order of Saint Lazarus on 25 July 1985</span> and was the senior chaplain tf<br>
the Victorian Commandery and has continued as a chaplain of the Order to the present day.<br>
Cardinal Pell has been decorated with Australia’s highest decoration, a Companion of the<br>
Order ofAustralia, and has been decorated by the Order of Saint Lazarus.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pell was the subject of allegations of sexual misconduct in 2002 over activities allegedly committed from 1978–2001 that eventually led to a court prosecution that was later overturned. Pell was convicted by the County Court of Victoria in 2018 on the charges of sexual offences.[5][6] In 2020, the High Court of Australia unanimously overturned this conviction and set aside the orders of the Victorian Court of Appeal rejecting appeal.[7][8][9] The separate investigation by the Holy See's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith into these allegations of abuse concluded upon his acquittal by the High Court, though it was previously thought to be ongoing.[10][11]<br>
<br>
Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse revealed its findings on Pell in 2020 and found that he knew of child sexual abuse by clergy by the 1970s but did not take adequate action to address it. Pell said he was "surprised" and that the commission's views "are not supported by evidence".</div></blockquote></div>

<span style="color:#00FF40">ROYAL EXCLUSIVE: The secret power triangle behind Rebekah Brooks’ illegal Prince Harry “stitch up” </span><a href="https://bylineinvestigates.com/2020/04/16/royal-exclusive-the-secret-power-triangle-behind-rebekah-brooks-illegal-prince-harry-stitch-up/" class="postlink">https://bylineinvestigates.com/2020/04/ ... stitch-up/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>IN THE first part of this new investigation into criminal newsgathering, we told how Rebekah Brooks, the most senior serving British employee of Rupert Murdoch, kept Prince Harry under illegal surveillance for a year when he was a child. Now in Part Two of the ‘Triple Whammy’ series, we look at the extraordinary soft power Ms Brooks brought to bear on the then 16-year-old prince and Buckingham Palace to legitimise her highly dubious tabloid operation.<br>
<br>
THE FIRST whispers of a ‘Royal drugs story’ reached Rebekah Brooks in February 2001.<br>
<br>
Rumours were washing up in the News of the World Editor’s glass-walled Wapping office that Prince Harry, just 16, was drinking underage and had dabbled with cannabis.<br>
<br>
The unlikely focus of the gossip was a Cotswolds pub called the Rattlebone Inn, close to Prince Charles’ Highgrove country home, near Tetbury, Glocs... And despite the fact his private life – while still in education at least – was officially off limits under an agreement between Fleet Street and its self-regulator, the Press Complaints Commission, Ms Brooks’s interest was piqued.<br>
<br>
But Rupert Murdoch’s hand-picked choice to run the best-selling newspaper in the English language had a problem – a total lack of evidence.<br>
<br>
So, to try and bridge the evidential gap, Ms Brooks turned to her trusted News Editor Greg Miskiw – a man steeped in the ‘dark arts’ of covert surveillance and voicemail eavesdropping.<br>
<br>
Mr Miskiw later admitted his part in hacking Royal phones, going on to become a whistle-blower on an area of tabloid criminality his former boss denied all knowledge of – under oath and on penalty of perjury – at her criminal trial in 2014.<br>
<br>
Now, he is giving first-hand insight into Ms Brooks’ triple whammy of tabloid surveillance and sting tactics, a deceitful war of attrition with Palace gatekeepers, and personal influence over a tame industry watchdog, to manufacture a seven-page story on Harry while he was still in his GCSE year.<br>
<br>
Pivotal to the strategy was <span style="color:#FF0040">Ms Brooks’s influence on Mark Bolland, the future King’s communications chief, with whom – along with his partner Guy Black – she was friendly enough to holiday together in Tuscany</span>.<br>
<br>
Ms Brooks repeatedly pressurised Mr Bolland to ‘stand up’ her story, having cultivated their friendship during his five years as press chief to Prince Charles and his children, whom – as minors – he also acted for.<br>
<br>
It is not known whether Prince Charles knew of the potential conflict of interest caused by this friendship, nor whether the palace knew how far it antagonised rival tabloid editors, further complicating the job of protecting Princes William and Harry from Press intrusion...<br>
<br>
JUST AS Rebekah Brooks was quietly locking on to Prince Harry, she met the other actors in her developing production at one of the most powerful and significant social events of the year.<br>
<br>
For in February 2001, the PCC used a big tenth anniversary party to mark the supposedly improving relationship between the papers and the Royal family, since the paparazzi-related death in August, 1997, of the Princes’ mother Diana, Princess of Wales.<br>
<br>
The event was seen as a Royal endorsement of a system that put the PCC between Buckingham Palace and the Fleet Street machine, controlling invasions of privacy, in return for managed access including photo-calls at milestones in the princes’ lives.<br>
<br>
Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles attended, as did Prince William, to show their support for the industry-funded self-regulator. So too did Ms Brooks, Mark Bolland, and Guy Black.<br>
<br>
This noticeable public stepping out together contributed to questions about the PCC’s credibility.<br>
<br>
Critics asked whether Mr Bolland should be so closely connected to Ms Brooks, editor of one of the main newspapers his PCC was “independently” policing, while his partner was also media manager of one of its top front-page targets.<br>
<br>
Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore attacked Brooks’s closeness to Mr Bolland and Guy Black. He complained the cosy relationship helped her corner and deliver up a vulnerable Prince Harry, with Moore even calling the PCC a “stitch-up”...

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Chickenshed (also known as Chicken Shed or the Chicken Shed Theatre Company) is a British theatre company based in Southgate, London.<br>
<br>
Chickenshed’s membership programme comprises four Children’s theatre groups and two Youth theatre groups for young people aged 5–21 years. They run Saturday and holiday workshops for ages 5–12 years and performance and singing workshops for adults. They also operate education courses in inclusive performing arts at BTEC, Foundation Degree and BA (Hons) Levels.<br>
<br>
Chickenshed was founded by teacher Mary Ward and composers Jo Collins and Anthony Filby in 1974. It began in a disused chicken barn in Barnet, which is how it came to be called Chickenshed. ... Chickenshed is registered as a charity under the name The Chickenshed Theatre Trust. In 1996, company founder Mary Ward was awarded the MBE for Services to the Arts followed in 1999, with a Creative Britons Award, to acknowledge her 25 years of work with the theatre,[3] while co-founder Jo Collins was awarded the MBE in the 2001 New Year's honours, for Services to Music.[4] Chickenshed has performed at a number of public events, including Queen Elizabeth II's golden jubilee celebrations in 2002.[5] A show to commemorate 100 years of J. M. Barrie's children's story Peter Pan was staged by the theatre company at the Albery Theatre, London in 2004, in order to raise funds for Great Ormond Street Hospital.<br>
<br>
..The first musical writers for Chickenshed were Jo Collins and Anthony Filby, who together formed Colby music, through which they published a collection of musicals that Chickenshed performed. The music team has since greatly expanded...In December 1997, Chickenshed released a single, entitled "I Am In Love With The World", performed by children from the theatre...The song was included on Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute, a charity album recorded following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. <span style="color:#FF0040">Diana had been the royal patron of the theatre along with Dame Judi Dench</span>, who is also a great supporter, and it was one of her favorite charities.<br>
<br>
..Late 2003 saw the release of The Chicken Shed Album, a compilation that marked the 30th anniversary of the theatre company. Contributors to the album included supporters of the organisation, such as Cliff Richard, Emma Bunton, Bob Hoskins and Kenneth Branagh, as well as three tracks by Chicken Shed itself. Jo Collins &amp; Chickenshed recorded a song, "Talk Through Me" for the 2007 show tunes album Over the Rainbow, in aid of The Association of Children's Hospices</div></blockquote>
