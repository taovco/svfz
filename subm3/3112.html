Was January 6th the Result of an Intelligence Set Up?<br>
<br>
The events on January 6th at the US Capitol look to be a classic false flag operation. In so many cases over the years, as with Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and with Osama bin Laden in 9/11, those accused by the US Federal Government of being the instigators of the biggest terror attacks on US soil turned out to be longtime assets of the very same Federal Government.<br>
<br>
Darren Beattie at Revolver.com suggests that the ranks of the three primary militia groups labeled by authorities as most responsible for the Capitol attack on 1/6 (the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters) are filled with ​federal undercover agents and federal informants, which is confirmed of Proud Boys leader, Enrique Tarrio.<br>
<br>
He says one clue to this is that there are upwards of 20 unindicted co-conspirators in the 1/6 indictments made against the Oath Keepers group, who played various roles in the Capitol attack and who have not been charged for the same activities — in some cases, more severe activities — as those named alongside them in the indictments. Beattie believes they remain unindicted as a result of grants of immunity (because they are either federal agents or assets).<br>
<br>
Beattie has found links between the 1/6 Capitol attack with the foiled kidnapping plot by the Three Percenters against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, which had also included a plan to storm the Michigan State Capitol.<br>
<br>
So here, we see the same Three Percenters group accused by FBI of their involvement in 1/6, with the same plan to storm a Capitol building and then we learn that 60% of the Michigan Plot's senior leaders are known FBI informants or undercover operatives.<br>
<br>
Beattie writes, "As the cherry on top, what if we told you that the director of the Detroit FBI Field Office [Steven D’Antuono], who oversaw the infiltration operation of the Michigan Plot, was subsequently granted a highly coincidental promotion to the DC office, where he is now the lead FBI agent for all 1/6 cases?"<br>
<br>
It's a very suspicious fact pattern. Beattie says, "This was just months before, a plot to storm the State Capitol of Michigan, involving one of the three main militia groups associated with 1/6, with the same FBI Field Agent who was promoted after this – after his infiltration operation – just knowing that just really helps to drive home the pressing plausibility of this most disturbing question that we're raising is what the Hell happened in 1/6? Was there a similar infiltration operation? And when you look individually at the cases of these unindicted co-conspirators, there are huge red flags there, that press this question even further."<br>
<br>
On Wednesday, Congressman Matt Gaetz seized on the Revolver News report to direct its pointed questions towards FBI Director Chris Wray, asking him about the extent of FBI infiltration into the militia groups, how many undercover federal agents and confidential informants were present at the Capitol during the so-called "siege" and what role did they play? And of all the unindicted co-conspirators referenced in the charging documents of January 6th, how many worked as a confidential informant or as an undercover operative for the federal government (FBI, Army Counterintelligence, etc.)?<br>
<br>
On June 15th, Chris Wray told the House Oversight Committee that he'd arrested nearly 500 people and that the FBI still had hundreds of ongoing investigations "Beyond those 500.”<br>
<br>
The FBI continues to aggressively pursue the 1/6 investigation, even though none of the protesters were armed and the one person murdered was a female Trump supporter by a Capitol Police officer, whose identity is being hidden.<br>
<br>
In short, it appears that the FBI organized the January 6th riot and is now framing Trump supporters for treason.<br>
