<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Thomas Keith Glennan (September 8, 1905 – April 11, 1995) was the first Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, serving from August 19, 1958 to January 20, 1961. <br>
<br>
Born in Enderlin, North Dakota, the son of Richard and Margaret Glennan, he attended the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire and then earned a degree in electrical engineering from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University in 1927, where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity.[2] Following graduation, <span style="color:#FF0040">he became associated with the newly developed sound motion picture industry, and later became assistant general service superintendent for Electrical Research Products Company, a subsidiary of Western Electric Company. During his career he was studio manager of Paramount Pictures, and Samuel Goldwyn Studios</span>, and was briefly on the staff of Vega Aircraft Corporation. <br>
<br>
Glennan joined the Columbia University Division of War Research in 1942, serving throughout World War II, first as Administrator and then as Director of the U.S. Navy's Underwater Sound Laboratories at New London, Connecticut. At the end of the war, Glennan became an executive of the Ansco Corp. in Binghamton, New York. From this position he was called to the presidency of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio</span>. During his administration, Case rose from a primarily local institution to rank with the top engineering schools in the United States. From October 1950 to November 1952, concurrent with his Case presidency, he served as a member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. <br>
<br>
..Within a short time after NASA's formal organization, Glennan incorporated several organizations involved in space exploration projects from other federal agencies into NASA to ensure that a viable scientific program of space exploration could be reasonably conducted over the long-term. He brought in part of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Naval Research Laboratory</span> in NASA and created for its use the Goddard Space Flight Center. ..<br>
<br>
Upon leaving NASA in January 1961, <span style="color:#FF0040">Glennan returned to the Case Institute of Technology,</span> where he continued to serve as president until 1966. During this period he helped to negotiate the merger of Case with Western Reserve University, creating Case Western Reserve University. After his retirement in 1966, Glennan spent two years as president of Associated Universities, Inc., a Washington-based advocate for institutions of higher education.

Case Western <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_West ... University</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) is a private research university in <span style="color:#FF0040">Cleveland, Ohio</span>. Case Western Reserve was established in 1967, when Western Reserve University, founded in 1826 and named for its location in the Connecticut Western Reserve, and Case Institute of Technology, founded in 1880 through the endowment of Leonard Case, Jr., formally federated.... Case Western Reserve has a number of programs taught in conjunction with other University Circle institutions, including the <span style="color:#FF0040">Cleveland Clinic</span>, the University Hospitals of Cleveland, the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veteran's Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland Institute of Music, the Cleveland Hearing &amp; Speech Center, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Institute of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and the Cleveland Play House. Severance Hall, home of the Cleveland Orchestra, is on the Case Western Reserve campus. <br>
<br>
..The town of Hudson, about 30 miles southeast of Cleveland, was a quiet antislavery center from the beginning: its founder, David Hudson, was against slavery, and founding trustee Owen Brown was a noted abolitionist who secured the location for the college. The abolitionist John Brown, who would lead the 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry, grew up in Hudson and was the son of co-founder Owen Brown. Hudson was a major stop on the <span style="color:#FF0040">Underground Railroad</span>. <br>
<br>
..By the 1960s, Reserve President John Schoff Millis and Case President T. Keith Glennan shared the idea that federation would create a complete university, one better able to attain national distinction. Financed by the <span style="color:#FF0040">Carnegie Corporation, Cleveland Foundation, Greater Cleveland Associated Foundation</span>, and several local donors, a study commission of national leaders in higher education and public policy was charged with exploring the idea of federation. The Heald Commission, so known for its chair, former Ford Foundation President Henry T. Heald, issued its final report, "Vision of a University." The report predicted that a federation could create one of the largest private universities in the nation. ..<br>
<br>
In 1968, the Department of Biomedical Engineering launched as a newly unified collaboration between the School of Engineering and School of Medicine as the first in the nation and as one of the first Biomedical Engineering programs in the world.[24] The following year in 1969, the first Biomedical Engineering MD/PhD program in the world began at Case Western Reserve.[25]<br>
<br>
The first computer engineering degree program in the United States was established in 1971 at Case Western Reserve. <br>
<br>
..Project Logos, under ARPA contract, was begun within the department on a DEC System-10 (later converted to TENEX (BBN) in conjunction with connection to the ARPANET) to develop a computer-aided computer design system. This system consisted in a distributed, networked, graphics environment, a control and data flow designer and logic (both hardware and software) analyzer. An Imlac PDS-1 with lightpen interrupt was the main design workstation in 1973, communicating with the PDP-10 over a display communications protocol written by Don Huff as a Master Thesis and implemented on the Imlac by Ted Brenneman. Graphics and animation became another departmental focus with the acquisition of an Evans &amp; Sutherland LDS-1 (Line Drawing System-1), which was hosted by the DEC System-10, and later with the acquisition of the stand-alone LDS-2.<br>
<br>
Case Western Reserve was one of the earliest universities connected to the ARPANET, predecessor to the Internet. ARPANET went online in <span style="color:#FF0040">1969</span> [same year as the first moon landing]; Case Western Reserve was connected in January, 1971.[96] Case Western Reserve graduate Ken Biba published the Biba Integrity Model in 1977 and served on the ARPA Working Group that developed the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) used on the Internet.

We were both soon at work at Ben Venue Laboratories, which had a contract to dry human blood plasma for use in the battlefields.

Controversy - On 4 May 2016, current Healthcare Sector CEO Bernd Montag introduced to the public the new brand name "Healthineers," along with a five-minute dance routine celebration outside the Healthineers headquarters in Erlangen. This caused immense PR backlash and ridicule for the company and its employees. The Financial Times called it a "Writhing spandex clad horror."<br>
<br>
So, this German company seems to like weird dance routines in its PR campaigns.. another one here (from YT channel Lumina Motion) with holograms which somehow reminds me of cloning : <em class="text-italics">Siemens Healthineers Hologram Dance</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/JctJN8FP3mE" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/JctJN8FP3mE</a><br>

Later I'll continue with the succeeding directors of NASA. They all seem to have been freemasons.  Somehow the coronavirus, the Guardian space stories and Bezos, Branson and Musk's flights of fancy to space are all linked.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Clark Funk, a lifelong resident of Taos and prominent figure in the local arts community, has died. He was 87.<br>
<br>
As the chief of the Taos Volunteer Fire Department for many years, he spearheaded efforts related to the renowned collection that still hangs in the firehouse. He was also heavily involved in the early establishment of Taos Ski Valley, which began as Twining Ski Cooperation.<br>
<br>
A run at TSV, "El Funko," was named after the longtime friend of the ski area founder <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Ernie Blake</span></span>, according to the ski valley's website. The name's "a playful jab at Funk's ski ability. Or lack thereof. According to Ernie, he wasn't a gifted skier and may well have fainted at the first sight of his namesake black diamond run in the shadows of Kachina," it reads.<br>
<br>
Funk was raised in Taos in a well-heeled business family, which owned for nearly four decades the Funk's Five and Dime store on the Plaza, with sister stores in Las Vegas, Raton, Gallup and Santa Fe...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Funk, a volunteer scout leader, was accused in the mid-1990s by five men of sexual abuse while they were involved in scouts decades prior. All of the cases were dismissed in district court.</span></div></blockquote>

<br>
Beginning in 1963 with Jerry Tully, New Mexico’s Boy Scouts seem to have possessed at least one pedophile Scout Leader at a time for the next three decades, with the last case coming in 1993...<br>
<br>
Only five years after Kennedy was added to the Boy Scout’s Ineligible Volunteer Files, <span style="color:#FF0040">Clark Funk is accused of sexually abusing multiple boy scouts. According to an article from the Taos News, Funk was accused of sexually molesting a 10-year-old boy in 1973 (aliased as John Doe #1), as well as sexually abusing another boy (D.B) in the early 1970s. According to their accusations, Funk initiated and performed sex acts on the boys while he was a Boy Scout Leader.</span><br>
<br>
Following Funk’s alleged abuse is a series of pedophile Scout Leaders that served in New Mexico during the early 1980s...

<br>
The next four years, two of high school and two of junior college were spent at NM Military Institute where he attained the rank of Cadet Captain. He attended the last two years of college at the University of New Mexico, earning a Bachelor Degree in Business Administration. Upon completion of college he spent two years in the Armed Service as a 1st Lt. in the 2nd Armored Division. In 1953 he entered into a partnership with his father in a chain of 5 and 10"s in northern New Mexico. <br>
<br>
He later became the owner of the Don Fernando Curio &amp; Gift Shop and operated the same until its sale in 1987. Clark helped establish the Fall Festival of Arts held each year in September, and started the show called "Taos Invites Taos." He was on this committee for 17 years. He was President of the Taos Art Association for five years during the building of the community auditorium. He was selected Man of the Year by the Chamber of Commerce. He was past President of the Taos Lions Club, Taos Volunteer Fire Department and the New Mexico State Firemans' Association. He was actively involved in Taos Ski Valley, Boy Scouts of America (Silver Beaver Award), and the First Aid Division of the American Red Cross. Clark enjoyed hunting, fishing and skiing.

Then<br>
Our 150-year-old adobe in Arroyo Seco has housed—and generated—a lot of history. This <span style="color:#FF0040">1969 issue</span> of New Mexico Magazine features an article on "Casa Cordova, a tiny restaurant in Arroyo Seco" (now Sabroso), as run by Godie Schuetz after Ernie Blake persuaded him to move to New Mexico.<br>
<br>
And Now<br>
Almost 44 years after Kenneth W. Hardy wrote that article, our restaurant appeared again in New Mexico Magazine. Cheryl Alters Jamison's A Patriotic Pig Roast highlights Arroyo Seco's annual Fourth of July "culinary fireworks" in the July 2013 issue:<br>
<br>
"Looking for a delicious way to celebrate the Fourth? Head to Arroyo Seco, a charmingly quirky bend in the road between Taos and Taos Ski Valley. Seemingly, every one of the 1,000-plus residents of this Spanish land-grant community comes out to celebrate the birth of our nation with a pig roast and parade. . . .<br>
<br>
"The annual pig roast is hosted by Sabroso, one of the most convivial restaurants in the state, hidden in a glade over a small bridge on the edge of Arroyo Seco.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Louis Moore Bacon (born July 25, 1956) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and chief executive of Moore Capital Management...<br>
<br>
In early 2019, it was reported that <span style="color:#FF0040">Peter Nygård</span> had filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Court in Manhattan alleging that Bacon had violated sections of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.[15] Nygård and Bacon had been previously engaged in a protracted legal dispute over two adjacent properties they own in the Bahamas.<br>
<br>
..In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in Costilla County, Colorado from the Forbes family. The 171,400-acre (694 km2) property sold for $175 million.[19] In 2010, Bacon purchased the Orton Plantation in North Carolina, which was built in 1735 by an ancestor, Roger Moore, son of James Moore.[20]<br>
<br>
In 2002 Bacon obtained Austrian citizenship, due to a special provision for figures who have made notable achievements for Austria. The decision was criticised, as no achievement by Bacon on behalf of Austria was documented.<br>
<br>
..Bacon contributed £500,000 to Britain's Conservative Party between 2010 and 2016.[22] Bacon also served as a fundraiser for American politician Mitt Romney, who was elected governor of Massachusetts and later ran for president.[23] In 2015, Bacon donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush..<br>
<br>
Philanthropy<br>
In 1992, Bacon created The Moore Charitable Foundation (MCF) to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that work to preserve and protect wildlife habitat and improve water systems.[26] Bacon has donated more than one million dollars to the environmental non-profit organization <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Riverkeeper</span></span>..<br>
<br>
In addition to his work in Colorado, Bacon has helped preserve and protect environmentally sensitive land in New York, North Carolina, and the Bahamas. His key conservation projects include:<br>
<br>
Robins Island, Long Island, New York: After purchasing the "Jewel of the Peconic" in 1993, Bacon secured the permanent protection of the land through a conservation easement and set about restoring a natural habitat that had been deteriorating for 300 years.[31]<br>
Cow Neck Farm, Long Island, New York: Bacon’s Cow Neck Preserve, LLC purchased the farm in 1998 and donated a 540-acre conservation easement to the Peconic Land Trust, thus preventing development and ensuring the protection of the area’s habitat.[32][33]<br>
Lyford Cay, Bahamas: Bacon is involved with the environmental restoration of Lyford Cay.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Beginning with the first people who inhabited Pasadena’s Arroyo Seco, there have been rumors of a spiritual connection to the place. The Tongva believed water running through the gorge sounded like laughter, which they attributed to the coyote spirit.<br>
<br>
In the 1920s, the narrowest place in the Arroyo Seco was dammed to control flooding, and it was named Devil's Gate Dam, for the demon-like face of a horned figure in the natural rock outcropping.<br>
<br>
In the 1940s, a group of occultists became interested in the area and attempted rituals intended to open a portal to Hell.<br>
<br>
The group included rocket scientist Jack Parsons (a follower of Aleister Crowley's Thelema) and L. Ron Hubbard (future founder of Scientology). Their goal was to bring forth a "moonchild," which they hoped would be an Antichrist figure that would lead a Thelemic revolution.<br>
<br>
In the 1950s, after Parsons perished in an accidental explosion, several children went missing in the area around Devil's Gate Dam. Though none of them were ever found, a serial killer took credit for two of the disappearances 13 years after they went missing. As the man, Mack Ray Edwards, was a construction worker at the time, their bodies were hidden somewhere in the concrete of California's freeways.</div></blockquote>

In 1935, while a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Malina persuaded Professor of Aeronautics Theodore von Kármán to allow him to pursue studies into rocketry and rocket propulsion. The formal goal was development of a sounding rocket. Malina and five associates (including Jack Parsons[3]) became known at Caltech as the "Suicide Squad" because of their dangerous experiments (and failures) when testing rocket motor designs. Malina's group was forced to move their operations away from the main Caltech campus into the more remote <span style="color:#FF0040">Arroyo Seco</span>.

So the link for Leonard Case Jr. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Case_Jr" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Case_Jr</a>., ends up redirecting, because the period won't stay with the link. so here's an archive of the wiki page you posted. <a href="https://archive.is/ILDXB" class="postlink">https://archive.is/ILDXB</a><br>
