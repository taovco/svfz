He received a BA (magna cum laude) at Harvard University[4] in 1954 where he was president of The Harvard Crimson. He then studied philosophy with Stuart Hampshire and Bernard Williams at New College, Oxford on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.<br>
<br>
As a graduate student at Harvard he was a teaching fellow and secretary to the Committee on Educational Policy at the faculty of Arts and Sciences. He received a PhD from Harvard[4] in Social Relations (combining social psychology and personality with anthropology) in June 1960. At Harvard, he worked with David Riesman, Jerome Bruner, B.F. Skinner, and McGeorge Bundy, and also studied with the anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn. At the University of Chicago he studied with the anthropologist Robert Redfield and the psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim.

Interesting thread about them, connecting them to orphanage from which children were taken by Laura Silsby, Silsby was captured on Haiti, trying to get out with 33 kids, without proper documents. Bill Clinton even intervened in that case.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>D.C. WEDDING TO REMEMBER<br>
<br>
WHEN Army Major Todd Hathaway recently married screenwriter/environmentalist Nora Maccoby at the stuffy Cosmos Club in Georgetown, the ceremony was as unlikely as their union. The Episcopalian-Buddhist rite was performed by a Jungian analyst with bell-ringing, a reading from Native American visionary Rolling Thunder, and vows to “love, honor, and listen to.” The couple met through the Energy Consensus Group, created in 2005 after a Christmas party where Maccoby challenged Donald Rumsfeld to recognize America’s energy policy as a national security issue. The bride and groom are proud parents of 6-week-old William Walker Hathaway. At lunch after the wedding, top solar energy strategist Scott “Sundoggie” Sklar listened as James Woolsey, Bill Clinton‘s former CIA chief, told of test-driving the Tesla Roadster (an electric vehicle that goes 0-60 in 3.9 seconds) and dusting a teenager in a Corvette. Also at the nuptials were “Solar Siren” Jodie Roussell, head of the American Council on Renewable Energy, who was deep in conversation with screenwriter James Scott Linville, just back from the Spanish set of “Garden of Eden.”</div></blockquote>

Those links connect Nora Maccoby to occult movie producers:<br>

<br>
And those links shows how Nora Maccoby connects Pizzagate alleged ring wherabouts with Dutroux child murder ring wherabouts, which is huge connection given Anneke Lucas testimonies about US counterparts of the trafficking ring (from what I remember):<br>

We know that he is connected to vague (in contrast to Pizzagate) description of who is the culprit - because he never likes to name them when it comes to satanic ritual abuse rings.<br>
<br>
But I've connected him to friends of Regina Louf, victim of evil elite pedophilic ring in Belgium - her story was heavily covered here: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1354" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1354</a><br>

Carine Hutsebaut is friend of Robert David Steele, Carine is also close friend of Regina Louf.<br>

<br>
That's Scientology/Lucis Trust-speak....  these intelligence characters, I mean enlightened souls who constantly speak about "The Awakening".. that was also a feature in the Hampstead case... I'm really fed up with this BS...<br>
<br>
So, I took another look at the infamous Maccoby family...<br>
<br>
Here's an article on Max Maccoby, .. no, not the son of Michael Maccoby, but his father and grandfather of Nora Maccoby :<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">A Tale of Two Jewish Communities in Westchester</span> <a href="http://www.richardjgarfunkel.com/2008/03/29/a-tale-of-two-jewish-communities-in-westchester-3-29-08/" class="postlink">http://www.richardjgarfunkel.com/2008/0 ... r-3-29-08/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Not too long ago I received a call from <span style="color:#FF0040">Miriam Netter, the daughter of the late Max Maccoby</span>, who had served as the founding Rabbi of the free Synagogue of Mount Vernon from 1927 to 1956, the year of his untimely death at the age of fifty-two. <span style="color:#FF0040">I knew neither Miriam nor her brother Michael Maccoby</span>, who were born more than a half a generation earlier. Miriam and folks from the synagogue were working on a party to celebrate not only the Maccoby Foundation, but the life of their late father. It seems that Miriam was surfing the Internet when she came upon my essay, The Connections Music, the Synagogue and Politics, which mentioned her father and his relationship with the great American Rabbi, Stephen Wise and his friendship with the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She was able to contact me through my website: <a href="http://www.richardjgarfunkel.com" class="postlink">http://www.richardjgarfunkel.com</a> , and during our conversation, I mentioned that I knew her father when I was a lad and admired him greatly, as did the entire Jewish and non-Jewish community of the City of Mount Vernon. I learned subsequently that there would be a celebration of his life, a dinner in his honor, and an address from his son, her brother, Michael regarding his father’s legacy on Friday the 28th of March. This event would take place at the new Sinai Free Synagogue, which is located on the same property as the now demolished Free Synagogue used to stand.  I promised her that Linda and I would be there, and we were.<br>
<br>
I met Linda at the Harlem Line’s Metro North stop in Fleetwood, Mount Vernon, and within five minutes we were crossing Gramatan Avenue, heading east on Devonia Avenue and turning north for one block on Columbus to the entrance of the Sinai-Free Synagogue. We parked easily, found our way quickly inside, said hello, made our contribution and quickly found Miriam Maccoby Netter and her family. We said hello, and eventually found a table with a couple who were around our age. After our introductions, we realized that we actually were acquainted. We had last seen the Rosensweig’s fourteen years earlier....<br>
<br>
..In 1906 Sinai Temple was founded as the first reform Temple in Westchester with the help of Daniel Hays. Its first Rabbis in those early days were Kohut, Warsaw until Joseph Gorfinkle, who served for twenty-one years from 1908 through 1929. It was during this period that it moved to Crary Avenue. Over the next forty years, Sinai Temple was guided by both Dr.Andhil Fineberg, who served until 1937, and then was succeeded by the great Dr. Henry Kagan who served though 1969. After Rabbi Kagan’s departure, Sinai merged with the Bronx Sinai Temple. In the 1920s a group of families broke off from Emanu-El, and eventually raised enough money to buy property on South Columbus Avenue, not far from Third Street, and they partially erected the new Jewish Center of Mount Vernon. Congregation Emanu-El continued to expand and they moved from the Masonic Temple on Crary Avenue and re-located to a new building on Lincoln Avenue in 1957, under the religious guidance of the liberal Rabbi Aaron Blumenthal.<br>
<br>
...Max Maccoby, the late great rabbi, was the spiritual leader of the Free Synagogue when I lived as a child in the City of Mount Vernon. Rabbi Maccoby, was a student of the late Stephen Wise, who was one of the most important Jewish leaders of the 20th century and the founder of the Free Synagogue of New York. By the time Rabbi Wise married my parents in 1935, he was famous and a confidante of Franklin Delano Roosevelt....<br>
<br>
The roots of the Free Synagogue emanated from the mind of Rabbi Wise in 1905. Rabbi Wise, who was from Portland, Oregon, was under consideration to be installed as the Rabbi at Temple Emanu-El in New York City. When he learned that the temple’s board of trustees would review his sermons, he withdrew his name from consideration. He was interested in a “free” synagogue that would appeal to Jews from all of the then three existing movements. He started to hold services in the Lower East Side, and the Hudson Theater, on 47th Street and in 1907, at the Savoy Hotel, with hundreds of followers, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., the father of the future Secretary of the Treasury, was selected as president of the new synagogue. The Free Synagogue held services often at the Universalist Church of Eternal Hope on West 81st Street, where, in 1910, over 1000 people attended a service. Wise reached out to all of Judaism’s branches, and with his great success and message, the congregation was able purchase several brownstones on West 68th Street, before they built their new and current synagogue and headquarters there in 1950. Unfortunately, Rabbi Wise did not live to see the opening of the new location. He died suddenly on April 19, 1949, only one month after celebrating his 75th birthday at a gala diamond jubilee ceremony in his honor.

The Therapist<br>
by Sandylee Maccoby<br>
explores forbidden love between a charismatic psychoanalyst and a beautiful patient. It takes us into the glittering salons of Boston society, the world of avant garde New York artists, and the politics of Harvard professorships. It is a story of passion and ambition, but, most of all, it is the story of a woman's awakening to self discovery and finding the courage to follow her dreams.<br>

			<div class="content">For the longest while I've wondered if Eleanor Maccoby was related to Michael Maccoby and his family.  See our related posts mentioning her here: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/search.php?st=comments&amp;t=%22eleanor+maccoby%22&amp;co=on&amp;forum=on&amp;b=on" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/search.php?st=com ... um=on&amp;b=on</a><br>
<br>
The answer is yes, by marriage.  She was married to Nathan Maccoby (who she calls Mac)  which she writes about in her memoirs:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/pb-assets/assets/documents/eleanormaccoby/Maccoby-1531429872283.pdf" class="postlink">https://www.annualreviews.org/pb-assets ... 872283.pdf</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pg.  114:<br>
<br>
We didn’t meet any other family members on that first visit,<br>
but on a subsequent visit we were invited to dinner by his cousin<br>
Frances, now married to a successful business man. After that we<br>
often stayed with Frances and her husband when we visited<br>
Portland. As it turned out, however, we were soon to move to the<br>
East Coast, and the member of his family with whom we became<br>
closest was his brother Max, the rabbi of the Free Synagogue of<br>
Westchester, in Mt. Vernon, New York. Max ran a reform<br>
synagogue and seemed to have no reservations whatever about<br>
welcoming me into the family. He and his wife, Dora, visited us<br>
often, and we stayed with them in Westchester when the<br>
opportunity arose. <span style="color:#FF0040">We became very fond of their two children,<br>
Michael and Mimi.</span><br>
<br>
Pg. 167:<br>
<br>
Another real benefit of our situation was that our nephew,<br>
Michael Maccoby, the son of Mac’s older brother Max, the rabbi,<br>
was admitted to Harvard, and we saw him frequently through the<br>
ensuing years. Max and his wife, Dora, occasionally came up from<br>
Westchester for a weekend with us and to see their son. We became<br>
pretty much Michael’s off-campus home. We went through some<br>
of the vicissitudes of his college life with him, feeling great pride when he joined the staff of the Crimson and was elected the<br>
president of the Crimson in his senior year.<br>
During all of Michael’s childhood, his family, of course, had<br>
never celebrated Christmas, and Michael had harbored a secret<br>
envy of his Christian friends, with their decorated trees, bright<br>
colored lights and all the rest. So on the next Christmas he wanted<br>
to join us for our celebrations. He helped trim the tree, sang carols<br>
with us, and woke up Christmas morning to find a stocking for him<br>
hanging at the fireplace. His mother thought we were leading him<br>
astray, and blamed us when he subsequently married Sandylee<br>
Weile, from a fairly prominent non-Jewish family. Sandylee and<br>
Michael and their four delightful children have remained a close<br>
and beloved part of our family over all the many years since that<br>
time.<br>
<br>
<br>
As it happened, my older sister Sue’s younger daughter,<br>
Helen Bee, was admitted to Radcliffe during our Harvard years, so<br>
we also had the pleasure of visits with her. She took my course in<br>
Developmental Psychology, and later came to Stanford as a<br>
graduate student in Psychology. Needless to say, she too has been<br>
a continuing close family member and I see her and her<br>
wonderfully interesting mathematician husband, Carl deBoor, as<br>
often as possible.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>When Rick Frechette became a Passionist priest in 1979, his goal was to minister to the spiritual health of humanity. Little did he know that one day he would also minister to the physical health of orphaned children and the needy. Born in 1953, Frechette graduated from Assumption College in Massachusetts with degrees in math and philosophy. He next attended St. John’s University in New York and studied theology as a seminarian, and was ordained a priest in 1979. After a few years as a parish priest in Baltimore, he met Fr. William B. Wasson, founder of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos™ (NPH, Spanish for “Our Little Brothers and Sisters”) and worked in Mexico in 1983 at an old hacienda that had been converted to a home for nearly 1,000 orphaned and abandoned children. As a priest and administrator, his next calling was to Honduras to help establish a second orphanage for NPH.<br>

He also founded the St. Luke Foundation which creates dignified jobs in social service fields including 29 street schools, water delivery to the slums, hospitals and clinics and burying the unclaimed dead from the city morgue.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I began to talk with some of the students in Monty’s inner<br>
circle, and there was one in particular with whom conversations<br>
became especially lively. We began to drift over to the commons for<br>
coffee, and then to date in the evening. His name was <span style="color:#FF0040">Ben Barzman</span>,<br>
a literature major and budding playwright. Of all things, he was<br>
also a Day Dodger—one of those people who didn’t live on campus<br>
with whom we campus residents seldom associated. He stood out<br>
from the rest of the Reed students in a number of ways. For one<br>
thing, he was older—definitely a man, not a boy. I later learned that<br>
he was about seven years older than me...<br>
<br>
He had never expected to go to college, <span style="color:#FF0040">but had been talked into signing up<br>
for courses at Reed by his good friend Nathan Maccoby, a recent<br>
Reed graduate,</span> famous among the in-group as the only student<br>
who had come close to beating Monty at handball...<br>
<br>
<br>
One evening Ben took me over to Monty’s house for one of<br>
the famous sessions of Monty’s storytelling, with his little group of<br>
faithful psychology students in attendance. Everybody except me<br>
was drinking and smoking. I think I was the only girl there. As<br>
Ben’s girlfriend I became a peripheral member of the group..<br>
<br>
It was a strange summer. Ben was a loyal and supportive<br>
presence, and we spent a good deal of evening time together.<br>
Sometimes we went over to his brother’s house to babysit for their<br>
four-year-old little boy. I learned something about Ben: he was a<br>
remarkably skillful inventor of games and stories, and together we<br>
had a good time keeping ourselves and the little boy entertained. I<br>
remember one game Ben invented: we would pretend that his little<br>
nephew was a lump of dough, and we would set him to rise for a<br>
few minutes, and then knead him vigorously and then carry him<br>
over to the corner of the couch, which was our “oven.” We’d close<br>
the oven door and leave him to bake. When we thought he’d been<br>
quiet as long as he could stand it, we would go and test him to see<br>
whether he was “done” (sometimes poking him with a pretend<br>
toothpick). When we pronounced him fully baked we’d slice him up and take delicious bites of him here and there. The little boy was<br>
generally a very active child, and when we thought he was getting<br>
too hyper it was a good game to calm him down with.</div></blockquote>

Ben Barzman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Barzman" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Barzman</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ben Barzman (October 12, 1910 – December 15, 1989) was a Canadian journalist, screenwriter, and novelist, blacklisted during the McCarthy Era and best known for his screenplays for the films Back to Bataan (1945), El Cid (1961), and The Blue Max (1966)... He was born in Toronto, Ontario to a Jewish family. He was the screenwriter or co-writer of more than 20 films..<br>
<br>
Blacklisting<br>
Like many of his colleagues in the movie business, Barzman was blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee.[1]<br>
<br>
His wife, Norma Barzman, was a Communist Party USA member from 1943 to 1949. In 2014, she told the Los Angeles Times, "one should be proud to have been a member of the American Communist Party during those years. Hitler was invading the Soviet Union, so there was no reason to be anti-Russian, they were our allies."[2]<br>
<br>
The couple moved to England so Barzman could work on the film Give Us This Day (aka, Christ in Concrete, 1949).[1][3] Following his return to the United States after directing Give Us This Day, Edward Dmytryk, one of the Hollywood Ten, testified about the Barzmans to HUAC in 1951. "To get out of prison he named us and a lot of other people," said Norma Barzman in 2014.[2] In the 1950s, the family moved to Paris, where friends included Pablo Picasso, Yves Montand, and Simone Signoret,[2] and later southern France).[1] Barzman did not receive credit for some films because of the Hollywood Blacklist.[1]<br>
<br>
His U.S. citizenship was revoked from 1954 to 1963.[1] His wife Norma had her passport revoked from 1951 for seven years.[2] The family remained abroad in London, Paris and Nice until 1976, during which time he wrote his novels and screenplays for French and Italian films</div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">I was a Hollywood communist - Screenwriter Norma Barzman spent years in exile after being blacklisted by the studios. Duncan Campbell meets her</span> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/oct/21/usa.gender" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/oct/21/usa.gender</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>There were two blacklists in Hollywood in the 1940s, says Norma Barzman, and she was on both of them. One was aimed at communists, and has been comprehensively documented. There was also a subtler one - one that's not as notorious as it perhaps ought to be - that excluded women from much of the film industry. Barzman learned about this second list not long after she moved to Los Angeles, 22-years old and newly divorced, as a would-be screenwriter...<br>
<br>
She and Ben first became aware that the police were on their case when they were tipped off by a young actress, also called Norma, who was on her way to a party the Minellis were throwing to celebrate the arrival of their new daughter, Liza. Spotting the Barzmans having an alfresco gin and tonic, the actress told them that she had been stopped by cops at the bottom of their street and asked if she was going to visit them. Two years later, in exile, Ben spotted a photo of the actress in a newspaper. She had changed her name to Marilyn Monroe...<br>
<br>
Gradually, she became disillusioned with the Communist party; the final break came in 1968 in Paris. So where does she stand politically now? "In the beginning, I saw that capitalism didn't work and that led me to look for another system. I still think capitalism doesn't work - there has to be some sort of socialist system - so I guess I'm a socialist now." Last year, she campaigned in Europe for John Kerry. "I wanted to keep Bush out - there really is a difference." She thought the president might have learned a painful lesson from what had gone wrong with the New Orleans rescue operation, "but he's smirking again"...<br>
<br>
In London, she has addressed a meeting with George Galloway, whose new publishing house is bringing out her book. She is also catching up with the actress Zoë Wanamaker, whose late father, Sam, founder of the now reborn Globe Theatre, was an old friend. Her reception here has been friendly but in the US her talks and signings have been disrupted by a few right-wing hecklers. She was also dismayed, when speaking at American universities, that few of the students knew much about the blacklist. "How can they get through college without a clue about it? They haven't even heard of the Hollywood Ten [who were jailed for refusing to testify]?" She thinks that the Patriot Act in the US and the use of detention without trial both there and here have echoes of the old days. "They're using fear the same way they did during the cold war," she says...</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1992:<br>
<br>
STANFORD -- Nathan Maccoby, professor emeritus of communication and associate director of the Stanford Center for Research on Disease Prevention, and spouse of Eleanor E. Maccoby, professor emerita of psychology at Stanford, died of a heart attack Tuesday, April 14. He was 80.<br>
<br>
Maccoby's interests ranged broadly over the uses of the <span style="color:#FF0040">behavioral sciences</span> and mass communication for human benefit. A psychologist by training, he began his research career with studies of the effects of Army morale and training films during World War II. His research included <span style="color:#FF0040">work on the utilization of educational television for the Peace Corps</span>, as well as studies of the application of mass communication and behavioral science for the prevention of disease.<br>
<br>
Maccoby was internationally recognized as a leader in the field of communication research. He served as the director of the Institute for Communication Research at Stanford in the 1970s and held the Janet M. Peck chair of International Communication.<br>
<br>
He was president of the International Communication Federation in 1974-75 and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the International Communication Association, the American Psychological Association and the Society of Behavioral Medicine.<br>
<br>
Maccoby also served as consultant to the National Institute for Drug and Alcohol Abuse, the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.<br>
<br>
Maccoby was born in London and grew up in Portland, Ore., where he was a high school tennis champion. He earned a bachelor's degree at Reed College and a master's at the University of Washington. After World War II service in the Army's Information and Education Branch under Yale psychologist Carl Hovland, Maccoby completed his doctorate at the University of Michigan.<br>
<br>
His first academic appointment was as Earl Newsome Professor of Opinion Research and professor of psychology and chairman of the division of research at the Boston University School of Communication and Public Relations. He came to Stanford in 1959 as professor of communication, and served as department chair in the early 1970s.<br>
<br>
Maccoby formally retired from teaching in 1977, turning full- time to a program of research in the uses of communication for disease prevention. This "second career" continued a program he had begun six years before retirement, as co-principal investigator on the "Three Community Study," and later the "Five Cities Study," which field-tested the effectiveness of various communication strategies in reducing heart disease risk factors among residents of California communities. He was published widely in academic journals of psychology, communication and public health.<br>
<br>
He is survived by his wife, daughters Sara Bellina and Janice Carmichael, son Mark, and five grandchildren.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>DESCRIPTION: A UFO crashes on a Caribbean island, setting in motion a series of events that changes the lives of Americans stationed at a secret military base. Established over 100 years ago and run by Controllers, the dark cabal at the heart of the deep state that dictates what information and technology can and cannot be released to the public.An other-worldly being connects with Otis, an officer at the base, whose ambition has trapped him in a horrible relationship with Penelope, the general's daughter.How will he choose between career ambition and freedom by risking his life to organize the Seekers to save the planet from the Controllers?The clock is ticking... All Stars Review for "The Intelligence":"In this one book, Nora Maccoby has brought together some of the most important ideas related to extra-terrestrial intelligence, human intelligence, and cosmic intelligence – everything is a form of energy with inherent intelligence. As a former spy who is also a top Amazon non-fiction reviewer, reading in 98 categories, it has taken me decades to achieve a diversified understanding that this one book offers any reader. The author has melded a vast potpourri of nested concepts of intelligence, consciousness, and universalism. I found this book gripping, enchanting, and uplifting.

You have it in your hands." - <span style="color:#FF0040">Robert David Steele, American activist for open source intelligence</span>; former Central Intelligence Agency clandestine services case officer; former Marine intelligence officer.</div></blockquote>

I'm kinda suspecting that Michael Maccoby is one of those leadership experts that recommended a President with Trump characteristics after the Obama admin as he has written about US president characteristics as needed according to the 'zeitgeist'.. a zeitgeist that is manipulated and nudged by the Deep State I should add.. controlled opposition anyone?  Anyhoo...<br>
<br>
Here's a weird video featuring Hathaway.. I only watched the first couple of minutes: A<em class="text-italics">rmy Major Todd Hathaway Talks to Pete Sumaruck About his Stolen Experimental Car and Trailer</em> <a href="https://vimeo.com/15615635" class="postlink">https://vimeo.com/15615635</a><br>

Hathaway also wrote a book on The Singularity.  He commented on it here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Todd-Hathaway/dp/1980259933" class="postlink">https://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Todd ... 1980259933</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Feb. 2018: This is an interesting summary of experiences over the years that lead to a simple conclusion: the world will know peace, but a false peace will precede the real deal.</div></blockquote>

Hathaway and Nora Maccoby are mentioned several times on this Project Avalon forum.  Examples:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I have another link somewhere else about Nora's involvement in various things that they also talked about here on the forum, involving alternative energy stuff and I think some kind of economic position relating to Asian nations. I haven't had the time to dig into any of it in detail but if I did, based on the info that's been pouring out lately, a lot of dots could probably get linked up pretty fast. A lot of this stuff has to do with graft and misdirecting funds, blackmail and similar things.<br>
<br>
I know that Simon Parkes was eventually exposed here as, what I think Bill Ryan himself termed a "sexual predator." I certainly hope these two were not personal friends of Mr. Alefantis because that would deeply disturb me much more than Mr. Parkes ever did. James Alefantis is not "just a pizza shop owner," because you don't just own a pizza shop in DC and suddenly meet personally with President Obama numerous times, visit the White House hundreds of times, get ranked as one of the most influential people in all of Washington DC and all the rest. Something stinks really really bad about all of this and the FBI is still actively investigating him. It's just been on the down-low and will continue to be on the down-low until probably about 9 days from now.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Cap d'Agde (French pronunciation: ​[kap daɡd]) is a seaside resort on France's Mediterranean coast. It is located in the commune of Agde, in the Hérault department within the region of Occitanie. Cap d'Agde was planned by architect Jean Le Couteur as part of one of the largest state-run development schemes in French history...<br>
<br>
The Musée de l'Ephèbe houses the bronze nude statue known as "l'Ephèbe d'Agde" ("the Youth of Agde"). The statue was discovered in the River Hérault and was housed in the Louvre Museum prior to suitable facilities being made available in Cap d'Agde to house it...<br>
<br>
Cap d'Agde has a large family-style naturist resort.[1] The Village Naturiste (43°17′42″N 03°31′38″E) is a large fenced-off part at the north-eastern edge of Cap d'Agde, although it is accessible along the public beach from the east. It is a self-contained town (sometimes referred to as the "Naked City"), where nudity is legal and common in the whole resort. In the evening, when it gets colder, more people are dressed, sometimes in revealing clothes. A local tourist tax is charged per person, per day.<br>
<br>
At the far end of naturism ethics, the village is also becoming a hotspot for swingers and libertines...<br>

<br>
Allegations of abuse<br>
In January 2002, a documentary produced by Denmark's national television and radio broadcast company, Danmarks Radio (DR), called Seduced By Sai Baba, analysed videos of public manifestations of Sai Baba and suggested that they could be explained as sleight of hand.[124] The documentary also presented interviews with Alaya Rahm, former devotee of Sathya Sai Baba, where he alleged abuse by Sathya Sai Baba.[8] As a result, <span style="color:#FF0040">in 2002 the parliament of the United Kingdom discussed the danger to male children of British families intending to visit the ashram of Sathya Sai Baba in case of individual audiences with the guru.<br>

"In 2004, the BBC produced a documentary titled The Secret Swami, as part of its series "The World Uncovered".[166] One central theme of the BBC documentary was again Alaya Rahm's sexual abuse allegations against Sathya Sai Baba.[167] This documentary interviewed him together with Mark Roche, who had spent 25 years of his life since 1969 in the movement and alleged abuse by Sai Baba.[167] The show also featured allegations from Sai Baba critic Basava Premanand. Premanand stated in the documentary that, in his opinion, Sai Baba faked his materialisations. Here, he claimed that Sathya Sai Baba was "not just a fraud, but a dangerous sexual abuser". According to his interview, he had stories which spanned 30 years, and he stated that his stories were similar, a common practice being the rubbing of genitals with oil by the spiritual leader. Among his claims were that one ex-devotee claimed Sai Baba "put the oil on his hands, told me to drop my pants and rubbed my genitals with the oil". Premanand theorised that many Indian boys were abused but were never heard from because they were too afraid to speak out, alleging Sai Baba was well-connected with the elite and powerful of India."

<br>
Robert David Steele defended the Maccoby family early on in the Pizzagate saga and said that us pizzagate researchers didn't know what we were doing. Now he's selling books as an authority on pedophilia.</div></blockquote>

One of the strangest facts out there. I was thinking why would Nora Maccoby do this if she was targeted by "pizzagaters"? There's no simple explanation to this, it's very suspicious and these people are real weirdos with connections to army/intelligence so we can suspect that they are connected to disinformation campaigns and much more.</div>

<br>
SWEDES WILL END ASSEMBLY LINES <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/28/archives/swedes-will-end-assembly-lines-car-makers-move-to-cut-dehumanizing.html" class="postlink">https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/28/arch ... izing.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1971:<br>
<br>
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 27—To reduce the “dehumanizing” effects of modern factory life, it was reported here today, two Swedish automobile makers, Volvo and Saab, have begun to eliminate that pillar of mass production, the assembly line...As part of a growing emphasis on team production methods, the parts will be brought to the cars and installed by semi‐autonomous groups of workers instead of the cars being transported through a gantlet of men, each of whom performs a single, monotonous job.<br>
<br>
The change in practice was described at a symposium on “Technology and the Humanization of Work” at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The symposium was held at the Bellevue‐Stratford Hotel.<br>
<br>
Opposed by Youth<br>
<br>
However, the new unrest relates to human relations as much as to mechanical monotony. As <span style="color:#FF0040">Michael Maccoby of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington</span>, a co‐organizer of the symposium, put it: “Modes of work and life‐styles that were acceptable in the past are increasingly felt as oppressive by young workers in factories, offices and development labs.”<br>
<br>
Concern over the morale of industrial workers is not limited to the capitalist world. Some months ago it was the subject of a meeting of specialists from Eastern as well as Western nations. The Chinese Communists have attacked the problem by installing selected workers alongside specialists on the managerial level and by insisting that the specialists spend time on the factory floor...<br>
<br>
Management Found Cool<br>
<br>
However, Mr. Maccoby noted that management was often cool to such programs because, even though productivity may increase, “humanizing work gives more initiative and autonomy to the worker.” “He or she becomes less controlled by the manager,” he added...Mr. Herrick noted that productivity per man‐hour in Japan rose 14.2 per cent from 1965 to 1970, compared with only 1.9 per cent in the United State.<br>
<br>
However, he questioned whether this meant that Japan's paternalistic labor practices were desirable. A recent survey of worker attitudes in Japan, he said, showed 48 per cent of them negative toward their jobs. The figure in a similar American survey was about 15 per cent.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>IMF's Prescription for Europe: Exploit Refugees with Low Wages<br>
<br>
Economist calls IMF 'the sancta sanctorum of neoclassical/neoliberal thinking.' <br>
<br>
The outcomes put forth in the report are unrealistic, he said. "Most probably, the first effect should be a workers substitution (more expensive for less expensive ones), thus increasing the xenophobia amongst substituted and at risk of substitution workers; the second effect, an aggregate decrease of salaries as GDP %, increasing profits and global inequality," Angusto said. "From the demand side, lower salaries should mean less demand than supply; a lack of demand that, if compensated by exports, should imply a beggar-thy-neighbour strategy, adding pressure to cut wages in third countries."<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Tiffany Williams, associate director at the Institute for Policy Studies, added: "In my field of human trafficking</span>, which shares many similarities with forced migration caused by conflict, advocates know that safe, paid work is one of the keys to helping displaced people rebuild their lives. It is important that the IMF is acknowledging that access to work is crucial. But creating a second class of workers who will be pit against the existing low wage workforce is a risky move which might fuel a deeper anti-immigrant backlash, undercutting efforts to humanely resettle vulnerable families."<br>
<br>
In Germany, which took in more than one million migrants and refugees in 2015, the current minimum wage is 8.50 euros ($9.1). The IMF's report follows a similar call by the German Council of Economic Experts (GCEE), which in November said, "The minimum wage is likely to pose a barrier to entry [into the job market] for many refugees. Considering the growing supply of low-wage labor the minimum wage should under no circumstance be raised."<br>
<br>
The proposal also comes in stark contrast to the measures recently adopted in Turkey, which currently hosts about 2.5 million Syrian refugees—more than any other country. The Turkish government announced new regulations earlier this month that will allow Syrians who have been living in the country for at least six months to apply for work permits, enabling them to earn the minimum wage or higher.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pervasive Challenges Across Industries: A Governance  Approach to Eradicating Labor Trafficking<br>
Conversation Lead: Ambassador Susan Coppedge, U.S. Department of State’s Bureau to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons <br>
<br>
The private sector alone cannot prevent labor trafficking and<br>
ensure a fully clean supply chain: meaningful government<br>
commitment is necessary. This agenda explored steps being taken<br>
by the U.S. Government at a federal and state level. The UK AntiSlavery Act was also identified as a powerful tool, particularly its stipulation that a corporation’s Board must annually sign-off on<br>
the report. Governments can play an important equalizing role in<br>
an industry, minimizing any competitive disadvantage resulting<br>
from good labor practices. Some saw the possible end of TTIP as<br>

In the case of epidemics, we have learned three lessons from<br>
the recent Ebola outbreak: speed is of the essence; “a blind spot<br>
anywhere is a risk everywhere”; and true accountability and<br>
assistance are needed when responding to an outbreak.<br>
<br>
Countries need incentivizes to be transparent in their reporting<br>
of outbreaks, and this should be matched with a partnership for<br>
response. When countries realize that they will be given assistance<br>
when they accurately report an outbreak.<br>
Prevention, vaccination, and preparedness are hugely important<br>
in mitigating the risks of an epidemic.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The panel called for a public health emergency response<br>
organization in the United States, similar to FEMA.</span> With<br>
the establishment of this agency, leaders would not need<br>

On 18 October 2018, Zahid was arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and charged in court the following day on 45 counts of criminal breach of trust (CBT), abuse of power and money laundering involving a total of RM114 million (about US$27.4 million) funds of Yayasan Akalbudi.[33][34] On 14 December 2018, he was charged with another CBT offence, involving RM10 million.[35] On 20 February 2019, Zahid was again charged with an additional CBT charge, involving RM260,000.[36][37]<br>

KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi (pic) says he is not afraid if anti-corruption officers investigate him over allegations that his family members profited from the trafficking of Nepali migrant workers.<br>
<br>
“I am not afraid and ready to be investigated,” said the former deputy prime minister.<br>
<br>
“I am ready to be shown evidence that I was said to have been involved or had abused my power or that any of my family members were involved,” he told reporters at Parliament lobby yesterday...<br>
<br>
The report stated that Dr Ahmad Zahid, who was the former home minister, had allegedly outsourced this to a private company,<br>
<br>
That company made it such that Nepali migrant workers were required to apply for work visas through a Katmandu-based affiliate firm.<br>
<br>
The report said the agency charged RM118 (Rs3,200) from every Malaysia-bound Nepali worker, and collected RM72mil (Rs 1.95bil) from more than 600,000 workers between September 2013 and April 2018.<br>
<br>
This included making it <span style="color:#FF0040">mandatory for all Nepali migrants to undergo a biometric health screening test via Bestinet Sdn Bhd, allegedly linked to Dr Ahmad Zahid’s brother-in-law.</span><br>
<br>
The Nepali newspaper report also claimed that Dr Ahmad Zahid’s brother Abdul Hakim Hamidi and former environment minister Tan Sri Azmi Khalid also reportedly owned shares in Bestinet.

<br>
WASHINGTON — The U.S. envoy on combating human trafficking will visit Malaysia next week, an official said Friday, amid complaints that the Southeast Asian nation has failed to investigate properly alleged official complicity over mass graves of suspected trafficking victims.<br>
<br>
The State Department has faced a barrage of congressional criticism after Malaysia, a key U.S. trading partner, was kept off a blacklist of countries that fail to meet minimum standards against modern-day slavery.<br>
<br>
Susan Coppedge, ambassador-at-large to monitor and combat trafficking in persons, will meet Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, during her two-day visit to the main city Kuala Lumpur starting Monday.<br>
<br>
Spokeswoman Mai Shiozaki said Coppedge will also will meet with senior officials in the attorney general’s chambers and the prime minister’s office, and host a round-table with nongovernment groups.<br>
<br>
The department says there are several million migrant laborers in Malaysia and more than 150,000 registered refugees and asylum-seekers who are also vulnerable to traffickers.<br>
<br>
The Obama administration controversially took Malaysia off its human trafficking blacklist in 2015 although it had secured only a handful of human trafficking convictions in the previous year. The administration denied accusations of political interference driven by Malaysia’s participation in the U.S.-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The upgrade of Malaysia to a so-called “watch list” came soon after the May 2015 discovery of suspected human trafficking camps and dozens of graves along the border with Thailand.</span> The watch list ranking was renewed in the department’s latest human trafficking report issued three weeks ago, which found that the Malaysian government questioned several officials in connection with the mass graves but did not prosecute any officials last year for complicity in trafficking crimes.<br>
<br>
Several lawmakers pressed Coppedge on the issue at congressional hearings July 12. She agreed that it was “troubling” that no government officials have been prosecuted or held accountable.<br>
<br>
Kristen Abrams, acting director of the Washington-based Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking, said Coppedge’s visit would send an important signal to Malaysia that “the world is watching.”</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita, an ocean-front resort located on a private peninsula surrounded by white sand beaches in the Mexican state of Nayarit, is close to completing a "multi-million dollar renovation" that will turn the secluded property into one of Mexico's most exclusive beach destinations, the hotel said on December 15...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">In 2014, in a vote of confidence for Mexico's buoyant tourist industry, Cascade Investment LLC, billionaire and philanthropist Bill Gates’ private investment arm, purchased the 177-room Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita and adjacent land</span> for $200 million in cash, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission....<br>
<br>
Gates is not the first billionaire to see Punta Mita's potential as a prime retreat for the well-heeled. <span style="color:#FF0040">Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim Helú has been involved for some years in Punta Mita's real estate scene through Inbursa</span>, Slim's banking and financial services company...<br>
<br>
Inbursa has a stake in Dine S.A. de C.V., the leading real estate developer for Punta Mita created 15 years ago when Dine bought property to develop a luxury resort with high-end hotels and top ranking golf courses. Arturo Elías Ayub, Slim's spokesperson and son-in-law, confirmed Inbursa's long-standing connection to Dine. According to Dine's web site, in recent years this private luxury enclave has become a magnet for executives from high-profile technology firms such as Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, Qualcomm, and British Telecom.<br>
<br>
In the past five years, MITA Ventures, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm that sees Mexico as the innovation bridge between Latin America and Silicon Valley, has hosted the MITA Tech Talks, an exclusive invitation-only networking event of Silicon Valley and Latin America investors, entrepreneurs, executives and policy makers. This year's MITA Tech Talks will take place from February 12 to 14 at Punta Mita's Four Seasons Resort. <br>
<br>
Part of the reason for Punta Mita's attraction is its relative proximity to the U.S. Puerto Vallarta’s International Airport is only a three-hour flight from California and has direct flights from all major airport hubs in North America as well as private jet access. And with its heavenly tropical weather, iconic beaches, Pacific surf, world class golf and privacy, Punta Mita is an easy 40-minute drive north of Puerto Vallarta</div></blockquote>..<br>

August 8 and 9 • Patricia Bauman's Residences<br>
PHOTOS BY KYLE SAMPERTON</div></blockquote>

This guy Kyle Samperton aka midnightcelt is everywhere. He really is photographer for the elite. I've found him through researching Maccoby wherabouts here: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2056" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2056</a><br>
<br>
Friends with Alefantis, Maccobys, Christopher Boutlier, and probably much more.<br>
<br>
Also that connection with that amendment is extremely interesting given that Todd Hathaway and Nora Maccoby Hathaway were socializing around Donna Edwards and James was donating her. From what I see Anthony Weiner and Donna Edwards voted no to amendment that would exclude pedos from that hate crime bill? Huh. Can't make this up.</div>

In addition to HIV/AIDS care, GHESKIO also provides primary and prenatal care, as well as treatment for tuberculosis and cholera, free of charge. The clinic also has a robust research enterprise—it’s been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health—and is dedicated to training the next generation of Haitian healthcare leaders.<br>

Weill, shortly after graduating from Cornell University, got his first job on Wall Street in 1955 – as a runner for Bear Stearns. In 1956, he became a licensed broker at Bear Stearns.[7] Rather than making phone calls or personal visits to solicit clients, Weill found he was far more comfortable sitting at his desk, poring through companies' financial statements and disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For weeks his only client was his mother, Etta, until his later to be wife, Joan, persuaded an ex-boyfriend to open a brokerage account...<br>
<br>
While working at Bear Stearns, Weill was a neighbor of Arthur L. Carter who was working at Lehman Brothers. Together with Roger Berlind and Peter Potoma, they formed Carter, Berlind, Potoma &amp; Weill in May 1960.[8] In 1962 the firm became Carter, Berlind &amp; Weill after the New York Stock Exchange brought disciplinary proceedings against Potoma...<br>
<br>
In 1981, Weill sold Shearson Loeb Rhoades to American Express for about $915 million in stock...While at American Express, Weill began grooming his newest protégé, Jamie Dimon, the future CEO of JPMorgan Chase...<br>
<br>
In 2001, Weill became a Class A director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Class A directors are those elected by Federal Reserve member banks. Also in 2001, Weill established several offshore enterprises, including one through which he owned his yacht. These entities were identified in the Panama Papers..<br>
<br>
Weill served as a Cornell Trustee for many years, and in 1998 he endowed Cornell's medical school, now known as the Weill Cornell Medical College. As chairman of the Board of Overseers of Weill Cornell Medical College and an emeritus member of the Board of Trustees of Cornell University, Weill orchestrated a $400 million donation to Cornell, of which he and his wife personally contributed $250 million.[22] In June 2007, he endowed the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology at Cornell, housed in a new life science building named Weill Hall. On September 10, 2013, Joan and Sandy Weill and the Weill Family Foundation announced a $100 million gift to Weill Cornell. Weill is Chairman of the Board of Overseers of Weill Cornell Medical College and Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, having joined the board in 1982 and becoming chair in 1995. Weill Cornell established the first American medical school overseas in Doha, Qatar, in 2001. This was made possible through a special partnership between Weill Cornell and the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. Weill Cornell's inaugural class in Qatar graduated in 2008. Weill also serves on the Board of Governors of Sidra, a 380-bed speciality teaching hospital was scheduled to open in 2014 in Qatar. Sidra is supported by a $9 billion endowment from the Qatar Foundation. In addition, he is a Trustee of New York-Presbyterian Hospital; a Trustee of Hospital for Special Surgery; and a member of the Executive Council of the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center...</div></blockquote>

MUST READ: Jerry Speyer: founding partner Tishman - Speyer<br>
<br>
"Speyer has served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,[5] vice chairman of the New York Presbyterian Hospital,[6] chairman of the Museum of Modern Art,[7] and vice chair on the Board of Trustees of the Rand Corporation.[5] Speyer is also chair of the Executive Committee and chairman emeritus of Columbia University, chair emeritus of the Real Estate Board of New York, and past president of the Board of Trustees of the Dalton School.[8]<br>
<br>
Speyer sits on the board of Carnegie Hall, alongside Sanford Weill, the former chairman of Citigroup, with whom he has a close business relationship (see External Links below).[9] His other board affiliations include Siemens AG and the Real Estate Roundtable, and have included Yankee Global Enterprises, the New York Presbyterian Foundation, Inc., and the Urban Land Institute. He is a member of the Economic Club of New York and the Council on Foreign Relations.[9]<br>
<br>
Speyer is also chair emeritus of the Partnership for New York City, founded by David Rockefeller."<br>
<br>
...He is one of two founding partners of the New York real estate company Tishman Speyer, which controls the Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building...Speyer was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Germaine M. and Ernest A. Speyer.[2] According to a 1998 profile in The New York Times, <span style="color:#FF0040">"[Speyer's] mother is Swiss</span>, and his father comes from one of the old Jewish families of Frankfurt" ..</div></blockquote>

Interesting that I can't find any background information on Speyer's mother anywhere, not even her maiden name...</div>

Septime Webre's Birthday at Comet Ping Pong, who's very close to Septime Webre and Mary Haft? ( you may recall both from nearly 5 years Pizzagate research topics or other new topic I've made on those DC connections not too long ago ) It's Mariella Trager. Izette Maccoby Folger, James Alefantis, Kate Damon - basically names we should remember from general 5 year old lasting Pizzagate research.<br>

Here's what she says about Pizzagate and James Alefantis on 21st November 2016, according to her he's not running a pedo ring. I'm sorry Ms Nora but everything points to different direction so far.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"the pizza gate" is a witch hunt, specifically targeted along political lines. Comet Ping Pong is not hosting baby eating cabals in tunnels underneath the building. this is total and complete bull**** concocted by Steve Bannon/Paul Manafort trolls. Wake the **** up people. This is increasingly a mob mentality. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">James Alefentis is yes, gay and parties, but he's not running a pedo ring.</span></strong> He's an easy mark. This discredits the alternative news community more than I have ever witnessed. It discredits the work that goes on daily to combat child trafficking.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?15915-Very-Disturbing-Jay-Weidner-Sacred-Mysteries-video--removed-&amp;p=1115573&amp;viewfull=1#post1115573" class="postlink">https://projectavalon.net/forum4/showth ... ost1115573</a><br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/5pIR0Gx.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/5pIR0Gx.png</a><br>
<br>
Here's another one:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I am certainly NOT in denial. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have been assisting, researching, and writing about efforts to stop child trafficking since 2004. It's going on, no question.</span></strong> But making a witch hunt from doctored photos and emails, using the mass public to judge - is appalling. The context of this particular "discovery" is highly political, there are innocent people that I personally know involved and now countless death threats against people who are a seen as "collateral". Using the MOB on the INTERNET to DESTROY people WITHOUT A TRIAL is WRONG. Child trafficking MUST be stopped. This is NOT how you do it.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?15915-Very-Disturbing-Jay-Weidner-Sacred-Mysteries-video--removed-&amp;p=1115626&amp;viewfull=1#post1115626" class="postlink">https://projectavalon.net/forum4/showth ... ost1115626</a><br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/4mnAx4y.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/4mnAx4y.png</a><br>
<br>
And another one:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I AM NOT A JUDGE OR A JURY. I deeply resent people who live behind screens using unsubstantiated data to destroy lives and commerce at MOB RULE. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I live in Washington DC and I know what I know by first hand experience. I have spent many years seeing law enforcement fight the darkest most degenerate criminals doing horrible things to children and I wish you could understand that we actually have a law enforcement system of amazing heroes risking their lives in increasingly dangerous circumstances.</span></strong> I have no idea about John Podesta - I highly doubt he has the time knowing his schedule - I do know he is vocal in his support of alien disclosure and he is passionate about Italian food, pasta and pizza, and bad art. I KNOW that many of the Wikileaks are compromised and constructed. I KNOW that Russian intelligence has used Assange as their message boy and they have agendas. The election is NOT OVER.<br>
<br>
AS FOR THE QUESTIONS BELOW:<br>
I'm not a private investigator. I am overwhelmed by the level of disinformation on the internet. All I know is what I know first hand, as I said. I am not a Clinton fan. I know Epstein is a pimp to the rich in both parties. As for pedophilia as a "thing" in DC....I'm sure it's happening but I have never seen it and I've lived here almost half a century. I do know it has no party affiliation and seems to transcend class, race, ethnicity and gender. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have friends who have survived assassination attempts for their work to stop it</span></strong>. There are many brave people out there working to rescue children. If you want to help, you can contact me. Sending spurious conspiracy videos around is not helpful and it distracts from the true crimes.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/iwRKJG2.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/iwRKJG2.png</a><br>
<br>
Another one, here she talks about her friend Aaron Cohen who is underage sex slave retriever. She also mentions Innocents at Risk, organization she and her sister Izette are associated with. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The networks are run by ruthless gangster mobs and the demand continues to grow. The law enforcement teams working on this are risking their lives every day. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have a friend who is a slave retriever, goes into bordellos and rescues the children, and he has survived over 6 assassination attempts. Not everyone is so lucky.</span></strong> The trafficking spiraled out of control after 911 due largely to the internet. Efforts with protocol of witnessing trafficking in action on buses, trains, planes, has saved thousands of children. There are a lot of organizations out there that are doing actual WORK to face this and deal with it. Innocents at Risk is an awareness organization that has actually done a lot to get different agencies to work collaboratively and more effectively.<br>
<br>
btw - it's extremely hard these days to discern real news from fake news. The pizza gate was an alarm bell as it is in my literal backyard and directly in my life and really smart people were convinced of certain "facts" <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">that I know for FACT are FALSE</span></strong>. The war we are in right now is perception, information, and psychological. This article should be mandatory reading for all well intentioned internet users of "news":<br>

What is false for certain? No family connection, no friendship, nothing should make one blind and incapable to investigate this.<br>
<br>
Another post of her, on topic of Pizzagate:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Kanye was and has been smoking serious weed laced with PCP and doing too much blow mixed with Molly. He spent all his money and had to fake a robbery to get insurance money. He has a history of nervous breakdowns. He created his problems.<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"> As for pizza gate, it is a political psyop to keep you busy on the Clinton conspiracy track.

<br>
And no, this isn't about "pizza" unless we talk "secret pizza" and pedophile sadist 'art taste' ( <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=11796#p11796" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=11796#p11796</a> + <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2687" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2687</a> ) of J'aime les Enfants otherwise known as James Alefantis, also, look how she quoted no police and no FBI investigation, because there's none to quote:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Onawah, "supportive of the public's attempts to get involved and help"....do you get involved in police investigations? <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">does it help to promote conspiracies based on doctored emails and photos that have no relationships</span></strong>? Remember when witches were burned at the stake? That was the "public" doing its job to stop the bad women. This is the same. I have never publicly had to defend anyone against false accusations but in this situation I have been gobsmacked.<br>
<br>
Now you want to call me out? Are you a detective? You want the public to do something? <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">You realize that the Police AND the FBI have investigated and found that this is a manipulated political hate crime directed at James. This is about pizza, not babies. </span></strong> That video clip somebody posted of a young woman "putting it all together" ...if that's your proof, my god, have mercy on your soul. Reality check: people do talk about "doing pizza" because it is a meeting point for many of us to yes, "eat pizza and hang out". <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">James is an incredible chef. He has 2 restaurants next to each other and there is a great book store. the whole block is a place where people come together and the language has nothing to do with babies being eaten.</span></strong><br>
<br>
As for taking off where Wikileaks left off - Wiki has been a direct messaging source for Russian intelligence. Their mission was to destroy Hilary by any means necessary. That s not over and no, I am not her fan at all. Their mission of confusing and disseminating information of this kind is not over, clearly. and btw the Russian mob is at the top of human trafficking gangs.</div></blockquote>

Emails are clearly not doctored so aren't the photos. Even the DCLeaks who are directly accused of being Russian agents released legit emails, just take James Alefantis/Tony Podesta/Catherine Chieco/Leslie Dach visit at Venice Biennale where friend of Podesta - Abramovic - cooperates with alleged child trafficker and pedophile Axel Vervoordt. There's proven connection between James Alefantis Instagram pictures locations and those emails.<br>

Nora is leftist, but her loyalty to tribe is ever showing:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>That never ends well...Putin must be laughing his A$$ off right now. Nukes to Kalingrad should make it clear how 'peaceful' Putin is...he is a former hitman/assassin for the KGB, with personal control over $100+ billion in assets, and still leading Russian intelligencia. You think it's good that Russia is taking over Syria...<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">tell that to Israel next year when they are attacked from the North</span></strong>. The U.S. will be tied up fighting with each other for stuff like Standing Rock that we will be weakened enough for Russia and China to counter the U.S. across the world.

And her last post on that site, she and her husband submit request to delete their account. Seems like Pizzagate was too much for them:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Attacks are what public forums such as Project Avalon are for apparently.<br>
<br>
The fulfillment of Garabandal could not come soon enough...you are welcome to fight amongst yourselves. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">The request to delete our account from the forum has been submitted.</span></strong></div></blockquote>

<br>
It's simple. If investigation is too much for someone to handle - it's ok but at least don't dismiss like this, if you are innocent though and attacks on your family were the reason why you dismissed this, that's not ok.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sean Christopher Stone (born December 29, 1984) is an American actor, filmmaker, and television host. With Tyrel Ventura and Tabetha Wallace, Stone hosts the RT America show Watching the Hawks. Stone and Ventura also host an online talk show named Buzzsaw.[1]<br>
<br>
Stone was born in New York City. He is the son of Elizabeth Burkit Cox and <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">film director Oliver Stone</span></strong> and has appeared in several of his father's films.[2][3][4][5] His paternal grandmother was French.[6]<br>
<br>
A convert to Shia Islam in 2012,[3][7][4][5][8][9][10] in an interview with CNN, Stone said that he accepted Muhammad as the seal of the prophets.[11][12] Speaking to Bill O'Reilly, he claimed Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's statements about Israel had been misunderstood.[9][8]<br>
<br>
Stone has acted in films since he was a child, including several of his father's films such as The Doors, JFK, Natural Born Killers, and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Stone has become a director in his own right with Graystone, a movie based on Stone's experiences exploring haunted mental asylums.[citation needed]<br>
<br>
Stone is a member of the Board of Advisors for the company MindShare Ventures Group based in New York City. The company is involved in several business areas including entertainment, commodities, healthcare, real estate, tech and venture capital. He was invited to the Board in 2013 by Founder and Chairman, Ali Naqvi.[13][unreliable source?]<br>
<br>
Sean Stone is one of the proponents of the idea that elections have always been rigged.[14]</div></blockquote>

And who is that father of Sean Stone? Oliver Stone?<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>William Oliver Stone (born September 15, 1946) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter.[1][2][3] Stone won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay as writer of Midnight Express (1978), and wrote the gangster film remake Scarface (1983). Stone achieved prominence as writer and director of the war drama Platoon (1986), which won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. Platoon was the first in a trilogy of films based on the Vietnam War, in which Stone served as an infantry soldier. He continued the series with Born on the Fourth of July (1989)—for which Stone won his second Best Director Oscar—and Heaven &amp; Earth (1993). Stone's other works include the Salvadoran Civil War-based drama Salvador (1986); the financial drama Wall Street (1987) and its sequel Money Never Sleeps (2010); the Jim Morrison biographical film The Doors (1991); the satirical black comedy crime film Natural Born Killers (1994); a trilogy of films based on the American Presidency: JFK (1991), Nixon (1995), and W. (2008); and Snowden (2016).<br>
<br>
Many of Stone's films focus on controversial American political issues during the late 20th century, and as such were considered contentious at the times of their releases. They often combine different camera and film formats within a single scene, as demonstrated in JFK (1991), Natural Born Killers (1994), and Nixon (1995).[4]<br>
<br>
Like his subject matter, Stone has become a controversial figure in American filmmaking, with critics accusing him of promoting conspiracy theories, and of misrepresenting real-world events and figures in his works.[5][6][7][8][9][10]</div></blockquote>

Interestingly there were sexual abuse allegations against Oliver Stone and he also defended Harvey Weinstein (associate of Jeffrey Esptein and Ghislaine Maxwell):<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sexual harassment allegations<br>
In 2017, former Playboy model Carrie Stevens alleged that in 1991, Stone had "walked past me and grabbed my boob as he waltzed out the front door of a party."[147]<br>
<br>
The allegation Stevens made surfaced after Stone announced he would no longer direct The Weinstein Company's television series Guantanamo following the revelation of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations.[147] <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Stone also drew criticism for defending Weinstein, saying</span></strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'm a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial. I believe a man shouldn't be condemned by a vigilante system. It's not easy what he's going through, either. During that period he was a rival. I never did business with him and didn't really know him. I've heard horror stories on everyone in the business, so I'm not going to comment on gossip. I'll wait and see, which is the right thing to do.[148]</div></blockquote>

Later, both Patricia Arquette and Melissa Gilbert came forward to say Stone had acted inappropriately towards both of them.[149][150]</div></blockquote>

<br>
So will Sean Stone mention James Alefantis, Maccoby family, and their connection with Anneke Lucas in his documentary, or will he just cover anything but that?<br>
<br>
Will he cover his connection to her?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>BEST KEPT SECRET<br>
Human trafficking, pedophilia, 'Satanic' politics... The Jeffrey Epstein scandal was the tip of the iceberg as Sean Stone, the former host of Buzzsaw, lays out the hidden agenda of the dark elite in this six-part documentary series. In this 'red pill' journey, Stone explores famous cases like the Franklin Scandal, MK-Ultra and Monarch programming, the Jon Benet Ramsey murder and even the Son of Sam case, to connect the dots of a dangerous ideology, now driving the philosophy of a 'transhumanist' idea - to remake the human being. As more and more people awaken to this hidden agenda, the more rapidly we can rise to take our power back. <br>

			<div class="content">Sean Stone, you sound like a shill here, not to a point of dismissing Pizzagate but pretty close? Listen to this guys, especially second half. 31:00 and 50:20<br>

<br>
As always I will try to not judge but this guys father is too sympathetic to foreign commies as well as defending domestic perverts (Weinstein) and Sean himself sounded pretty troubled when discussing Pizzagate, and he knows Nora Maccoby before this whole thing started.</div>

<br>
Some interesting quotes about him from guardian article:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Or that both <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Steven Spielberg and Oliver Stone have been vying to buy the rights to his book Slave Hunter</span></strong>: One Man's Global Quest to Free Victims of Human Trafficking, and turn his life into a film?</div></blockquote>

So do you remember that Oliver Stone is pro Putin, pro Weinstein father of Sean Stone - who is friend of Nora Maccoby and running documents about satanic ritual abuse with mention of Anneke Lucas (SRA alleged victim, friend of Nora) and ... Reptilians. But he tried to distance himself from Pizzagate.<br>
<br>
All described in this thread.<br>
<br>
Going back to Cohen. Another quote about him from guardian article, he studied Kabbalah for years and infiltrated criminal gangs of human traffickers.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>There are moments reading the book when I wonder if he's not a bit of a fantasist: the facts of his life seem so incredible. The rock-band antics, <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">the years of Kabbalah study</span></strong>, the <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">infiltration of criminal gangs</span></strong> and consorting with drug smugglers and human traffickers.</div></blockquote>

Lets not forget he is the one who liked photography of kids inside of Comet Ping Pong, posted by Nora Maccoby:<br>

Among people liking it is Aaron Cohen, who is friend of Nora Maccoby and is combating underage sex slavery ... very interesting connection.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Further to your letter <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">from Annie Maccoby (12 May), who had been sitting with Bianca Jagger</span></strong> at the performance of Einstein on the Beach that Jagger seriously disrupted by frequently taking flash photography and after which I publicly confronted her, I would point out that Jagger's behaviour was both illegal (a breach of performance copyright), as well as potentially dangerous to the performers. My reprimand of Jagger, on the other hand, was timely and appropriate, and has, I hope, served as a useful message that people can and should stand up to selfish behaviour in the theatre from fellow audience members, whoever they are.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Bianca Jagger camera incident at the Einstein on the Beach premiere (G2, 12 May) has prompted talk about theatre etiquette.

She also published a book now: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quest-Love-Memoir-Child-Slave/dp/B0B4FV3982" class="postlink">https://www.amazon.com/Quest-Love-Memoi ... B0B4FV3982</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This memoir invites the reader into the heart and mind of a young Belgian girl as she shares events out of one year of her life, her voice supported by the vocabulary and understanding of the adult author. The child’s circumstances are brutal; she is being sold by a mentally ill mother into a murderous pedophile network. She desperately clings to the belief that in spite of all appearances, true love does exist, and searches for the faintest sign of it in the midst of hell. When her blind love for her mother is transferred onto a charming perpetrator, she experiences romantic passion, but is soon cast into abject betrayal and violence, ultimately leading to her certain demise. In the darkest of circumstances, a near-death experience shows her the truth underlying her phenomenal world, and she is given a glimpse of that great love for which she is so desperately seeking.<br>
<br>
Extreme, organized child abuse is horrifying, and often impossible to contemplate. And yet, acknowledging the reality of darkness is the first step towards healing. This account offers both the raw, cold facts as well as the resilience and grace from the victim’s perspective, revealing that the darkest of nightmares is rarely just that, but commensurate with gifts of light. This ten-year old’s journey suggests that heinous suffering can unlock hidden spiritual treasures of transcendence and unconditional love.</div></blockquote>

Here's what she says about Pizzagate and James Alefantis on 21st November 2016, according to her he's not running a pedo ring. I'm sorry Ms Nora but everything points to different direction so far.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"the pizza gate" is a witch hunt, specifically targeted along political lines. Comet Ping Pong is not hosting baby eating cabals in tunnels underneath the building. this is total and complete bull**** concocted by Steve Bannon/Paul Manafort trolls. Wake the **** up people. This is increasingly a mob mentality. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">James Alefentis is yes, gay and parties, but he's not running a pedo ring.</span></strong> He's an easy mark. This discredits the alternative news community more than I have ever witnessed. It discredits the work that goes on daily to combat child trafficking.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Here's another one:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I am certainly NOT in denial. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have been assisting, researching, and writing about efforts to stop child trafficking since 2004. It's going on, no question.</span></strong> But making a witch hunt from doctored photos and emails, using the mass public to judge - is appalling. The context of this particular "discovery" is highly political, there are innocent people that I personally know involved and now countless death threats against people who are a seen as "collateral". Using the MOB on the INTERNET to DESTROY people WITHOUT A TRIAL is WRONG. Child trafficking MUST be stopped. This is NOT how you do it.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/4mnAx4y.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/4mnAx4y.png</a><br>
<br>
And another one:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I AM NOT A JUDGE OR A JURY. I deeply resent people who live behind screens using unsubstantiated data to destroy lives and commerce at MOB RULE. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I live in Washington DC and I know what I know by first hand experience. I have spent many years seeing law enforcement fight the darkest most degenerate criminals doing horrible things to children and I wish you could understand that we actually have a law enforcement system of amazing heroes risking their lives in increasingly dangerous circumstances.</span></strong> I have no idea about John Podesta - I highly doubt he has the time knowing his schedule - I do know he is vocal in his support of alien disclosure and he is passionate about Italian food, pasta and pizza, and bad art. I KNOW that many of the Wikileaks are compromised and constructed. I KNOW that Russian intelligence has used Assange as their message boy and they have agendas. The election is NOT OVER.<br>
<br>
AS FOR THE QUESTIONS BELOW:<br>
I'm not a private investigator. I am overwhelmed by the level of disinformation on the internet. All I know is what I know first hand, as I said. I am not a Clinton fan. I know Epstein is a pimp to the rich in both parties. As for pedophilia as a "thing" in DC....I'm sure it's happening but I have never seen it and I've lived here almost half a century. I do know it has no party affiliation and seems to transcend class, race, ethnicity and gender. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have friends who have survived assassination attempts for their work to stop it</span></strong>. There are many brave people out there working to rescue children. If you want to help, you can contact me. Sending spurious conspiracy videos around is not helpful and it distracts from the true crimes.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Another one, here she talks about her friend Aaron Cohen who is underage sex slave retriever. She also mentions Innocents at Risk, organization she and her sister Izette are associated with. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The networks are run by ruthless gangster mobs and the demand continues to grow. The law enforcement teams working on this are risking their lives every day. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have a friend who is a slave retriever, goes into bordellos and rescues the children, and he has survived over 6 assassination attempts. Not everyone is so lucky.</span></strong> The trafficking spiraled out of control after 911 due largely to the internet. Efforts with protocol of witnessing trafficking in action on buses, trains, planes, has saved thousands of children. There are a lot of organizations out there that are doing actual WORK to face this and deal with it. Innocents at Risk is an awareness organization that has actually done a lot to get different agencies to work collaboratively and more effectively.<br>
<br>
btw - it's extremely hard these days to discern real news from fake news. The pizza gate was an alarm bell as it is in my literal backyard and directly in my life and really smart people were convinced of certain "facts" <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">that I know for FACT are FALSE</span></strong>. The war we are in right now is perception, information, and psychological. This article should be mandatory reading for all well intentioned internet users of "news":<br>

What is false for certain? No family connection, no friendship, nothing should make one blind and incapable to investigate this.<br>
<br>
Another post of her, on topic of Pizzagate:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Kanye was and has been smoking serious weed laced with PCP and doing too much blow mixed with Molly.

And no, this isn't about "pizza" unless we talk "secret pizza" and pedophile sadist 'art taste' ( <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=11796#p11796" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.p ... 796#p11796</a> + <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2687" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2687</a> ) of J'aime les Enfants otherwise known as James Alefantis, also, look how she quoted no police and no FBI investigation, because there's none to quote:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Onawah, "supportive of the public's attempts to get involved and help"....do you get involved in police investigations? <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">does it help to promote conspiracies based on doctored emails and photos that have no relationships</span></strong>? Remember when witches were burned at the stake? That was the "public" doing its job to stop the bad women. This is the same. I have never publicly had to defend anyone against false accusations but in this situation I have been gobsmacked.<br>
<br>
Now you want to call me out? Are you a detective? You want the public to do something? <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">You realize that the Police AND the FBI have investigated and found that this is a manipulated political hate crime directed at James. This is about pizza, not babies. </span></strong> That video clip somebody posted of a young woman "putting it all together" ...if that's your proof, my god, have mercy on your soul. Reality check: people do talk about "doing pizza" because it is a meeting point for many of us to yes, "eat pizza and hang out". <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">James is an incredible chef. He has 2 restaurants next to each other and there is a great book store. the whole block is a place where people come together and the language has nothing to do with babies being eaten.</span></strong><br>
<br>
As for taking off where Wikileaks left off - Wiki has been a direct messaging source for Russian intelligence. Their mission was to destroy Hilary by any means necessary. That s not over and no, I am not her fan at all. Their mission of confusing and disseminating information of this kind is not over, clearly. and btw the Russian mob is at the top of human trafficking gangs.</div></blockquote>

Emails are clearly not doctored so aren't the photos. Even the DCLeaks who are directly accused of being Russian agents released legit emails, just take James Alefantis/Tony Podesta/Catherine Chieco/Leslie Dach visit at Venice Biennale where friend of Podesta - Abramovic - cooperates with alleged child trafficker and pedophile Axel Vervoordt. There's proven connection between James Alefantis Instagram pictures locations and those emails.<br>

It's simple. If investigation is too much for someone to handle - it's ok but at least don't dismiss like this, if you are innocent though and attacks on your family were the reason why you dismissed this, that's not ok.

Nora Maccoby and her husband Todd loved to peddle conspiracy theories about illuminati and freemasons and reality being controlled experiment. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">So what about us asking questions about them now</span></strong>.<br>
<br>
Here some user on Avalon where Nora and Todd were active is outing Nora and Todd as being "defensive, by means of over the top counter attacks":<br>
<br>
<a href="https://archive.is/maar3/e908cd8d9011b5a2f70d2fc73022e082721bb264.jpg" class="postlink">https://archive.is/maar3/e908cd8d9011b5 ... 1bb264.jpg</a><br>
<br>
And here Nora &amp; Todd made a post in topic called "Do the illuminati know about the ascension?" as my previous quoted post proves, they deleted many many posts on that forum somewhere in Summer of 2016.<br>
<br>

<br>
Why dont you ask James Alefantis or Podesta brothers about this?<br>
<br>

<br>
Here's Nora indicating JA of WikiLeaks is masonic by releasing emails in 33 parts:<br>

<br>
And if we really want to go towards the rabbit hole, who is this user who called out Nora Maccoby for being luciferian insider, 7 years ago, before Pizzagate, under YT video talk of Nora Maccoby.<br>
<br>

9/11 conspiracy theories? Hm. This YouTube profile sends you towards rabbit hole of controlled opposition alt right channels and Russian state backed channels:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.freedomtown.org/Freedomtown-2017.html" class="postlink">http://www.freedomtown.org/Freedomtown-2017.html</a> [ <a href="https://archive.ph/po2VA" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/po2VA</a> ]<br>
<br>
When you click on the cat however, it will lead you to subreddit about 9/11:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/" class="postlink">https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/</a><br>
<br>
Now isn't Sean Stone a gatekeeper on Pizzagate injecting [reptile poison] who is also pushing that 9/11 was inside job?<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2387654/Sean-Stone-says-9-11-inside-job-Hezbollah-terrorists.html" class="postlink">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/articl ... rists.html</a><br>
<br>
Many patterns of gatekeeping are detected among these people ...<br>
<br>
And finally. What about those networks of shills connected back to your circle and feeding false info or disinfo around certain topics or pretending that they oppose each other?</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong">Anneke Lucas: the memoirs of a child sex slave</strong></span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Anneke Lucas was sold by her mother to a network of elite pedophiles in Belgium. Michiel Nihoul (known from the Dutroux case) played a key role as the organizer of orgies in castles and villas, where she was taken as a young girl in the 1970s. An ambiguous love affair with a pedophile ultimately proved to be her salvation in escaping the network. 48 years later, Anneke Lucas describes in a breathtaking way the memoirs of a child sex slave in her autobiographical novel 'Search for Love'.</strong><br>
<br>
Anneke Lucas begins her story at the age of 10, when in the spring of 1974 she has been abused for four years as a child sex slave by a pedophile network in the 'highest circles' of Belgium. Her narcissistic psychopathic mother had sold her to the network as early as age 6. Her stepfather, an alcoholic, showed little interest in the well-being of his stepdaughter.<br>
<br>
To the outside world, she appears to grow up in a normal family. Anneke goes to school during the week. On weekends, her mother takes her to sex parties in castles, villas and mansions, where she is raped for hours on end. She ends up being abused by the network for five and a half years. Anneke Lucas has calculated that she was raped more than 1,700 times before she reached the age of 12.<br>

<em class="text-italics">Castle domain Kattenhof in 's-Gravenwezel (Belgium) was one of the locations where 10-year-old Anneke was taken to an orgy.</em><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Searching for love</span></strong><br>
<br>
In her desperate search for love in whatever form, Anneke at the age of 10 has a dubious love affair with Patrick Haemers , a rich man's son and top criminal. Initially he seems to be protecting her and she becomes involved in a complex and intense romance with the 22-year-old man. He tells her: “Having a normal relationship (…) is very different from what we have now. Now there's the excitement, because it's illegal. You are the forbidden fruit.” But once he feels rejected, he mistreats her and puts her in life-threatening situations.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Elite pedophilia is the world's best protected secret.”<br>
 - ANNEKE LUCAS</em><br>
<br>
In the network, it was common for children who became a nuisance or were deemed unnecessary to be eliminated. By now Anneke had seen enough murders to realize that now that she had reached the teenage age, the chance of survival was nil. In a desperate attempt to survive, she clings to those who gave her a glimmer of hope in order to escape the network.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Entangled in a network of sex, torture and murder</span></strong><br>
<br>
The description of her last year and a half in the pedo network and the way in which she eventually escapes her death, reads like a true thriller. Despite the gruesome details of its disastrous existence, the book is a real page-turner . Not only because as a reader you want to know how she will get out of the most precarious situations, but also because Anneke Lucas has managed to articulate her dramatic life story in such a beautiful way.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Big names mean great danger.”<br>
 - ANNEKE LUCAS</em><br>
<br>
The story of Anneke Lucas is not separate from the network in the Dutroux case. In both cases it is intertwined with the highest circles of the Belgian establishment. Although Marc Dutroux (who is only seven years older than Anneke Lucas) would not become active in the network until years later, businessman Michel Nihoul played a central role in both cases. She writes: “Nihoul has quickly made himself indispensable as an intermediary between the underage victims, pimps, pedophiles and Polo*. He manages everything at the orgies, tirelessly running around to please the bigwigs.”<br>
<br>
* Polo is the nickname of Paul Vanden Boeynants, former Belgian Prime Minister and Minister of Defence<br>

 - 11-YEAR-OLD ANNEKE TRIES TO EXPLAIN TO HER 14-YEAR-OLD BOYFRIEND WHAT WORLD SHE IS TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM</em><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Michel Nihoul (1941-2019)</span></strong><br>
<br>
On August 15, 1996, Michel Nihoul was arrested as one of the main suspects in the Dutroux case, the largest pedophilia scandal in Belgian history. Marc Dutroux is eventually convicted of the murder of four girls, kidnapping and rape of a total of six girls, two of which survived.<br>
<br>
Several witnesses in the investigation into the network around Dutroux point to Michel Nihoul as the organizer of pedophile sex parties. He would also be involved in satanic ritual abuse and infanticide. The testimony of Regina Louf (X1) is notable for the detailed descriptions of a number of unsolved child murders. She knows how to describe details that have never been brought out before and that match the facts. Her testimony eventually leads to the reopening of the investigation into the unsolved murder of Christine van Hees, in which Michel Nihoul is also said to be involved.<br>
<br>
However, two years later, this case is closed again before it is resolved. No one questioned the fact that the investigating judge on the case had previously been Michel Nihoul's girlfriend's lawyer, nor that the investigating judge's sister was Michel Nihoul's son's godmother. Meanwhile, the Belgian media starts a hysterical hate campaign with the aim of 'exposing' Regina Louf as a fantastic and deranged woman. In the end, Michel Nihoul is only convicted in the Dutroux case for forgery of documents, drug trafficking and trafficking in stolen vehicles. He is only serving two years of the four years for which he was sentenced.<br>
<br>
Years later, he boasted to the media: "Everyone has an incriminating file on everyone to use as leverage when the opportunity arises." He charges 1000 marks for an interview with Spiegel. "Add another 20,000 and I'll give you a minister in office who's involved in a murder." Allegedly all provable: “I know the killer and I will have him call the minister. You're listening, okay?" ( Spiegel – Im Netz der Dossiers, 2001)</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">MK-ultra torture training and survival tactics</span></strong><br>
<br>
Anneke Lucas' book also provides insight into the world of satanic ritual abuse. She references MK-ultra programming, trauma-based torture training, to prepare her for a role as a sex slave and future spy at the highest political level. An international high-profile in Germany promised her a life of fame, glamor and wealth, on the condition that she pay the highest price. She refused to make that sacrifice. Her suicide program that was supposed to be in effect was also not activated. Finally she was sent back to Belgium.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">------------------------------------------</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“He would like to secretly own the French celebrity that I would become under his leadership. I had to exist completely for him, without a thought of my own.”</em><br>
<br>
Against the backdrop of impressive villas and carefully landscaped castle gardens, a dark world of infanticides, hunting parties, perversions, cannibalism, torture and power games played out. Anneke describes how her mind dissociated when the violence was too overwhelming. “During the first rapes of this night, in order not to feel the terror and the physical pain, I automatically break into many different parts, most of which are not even there.”<br>
<br>
<img src="https://www.ellaster.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/VanRevelingen_Sint-Genesius_sepia.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Revelingen Castle, Sint-Genesius-Rode was one of the locations where orgies with children were held.</em><br>
<br>
To survive in this world she had learned to maneuver through the web of trickery and deceit, avoiding the dangerous men, ignoring the indifferent men, and attracting the more or less reliable men. Her survival techniques were based not only on the intuition honed by torture training, but also on the ability to meld with the vulnerability and deepest desires of her abusers.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">From victim to perpetrator, but still a child</span></strong><br>
<br>
Anneke Lucas describes the game between victim and abuser, in which both roles fade. “The Belgians also force us children to do horrific things, to ensure that we will never know that we are their victims, but we are perpetrators, just as bad as they are.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">------------------------------------------</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“You're making a mistake,” Nihoul warns the man leaving the room. "She's going to give us trouble."</em><br>
<br>
Her story thus offers a deep insight into the psyche of her main abuser, who has also been a victim. “Patrick has power over me, but neither of us is free. The powerful fear their love (weakness) as much as the powerless fear their power (wickedness). And fear entangles everyone in their roles.”<br>
<br>
The book thus exposes the vicious circle of victimization and perpetration, as well as the collective inability to see the manipulation and grotesque abuse in all layers of society, "even if the signals and consequences of this abuse are everywhere." .<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Influential people</span></strong><br>
<br>
Despite Anneke Lucas describing her personal life story, her memoirs are controversial, "because extreme events involving well-known political figures can easily fuel one's own unresolved traumas and feelings toward authority figures, and threaten one's core beliefs and philosophy."<br>
<br>
Anneke Lucas mentions some names from the network in the book, at least those who have died. In addition to top criminal Patrick Haemers (1952-1993), who has also been designated by witnesses as a member of the Gang van Nijvel, she mentions Paul (Polo) Vanden Boeynants (1919-2001). Vanden Boeynants (VDB) was Prime Minister of Belgium twice and, as Minister of Defense, played an important role in concluding international arms deals.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Paul Vanden Boeynants and the Dutroux case</span></strong><br>
<br>
VDB was discredited in 1985 for tax evasion, but did not have to go to prison because of his "services to the state". In 1993, his name was cleared and the investigation into his involvement in fraud, counterfeiting and drug trafficking was closed so that he could run for the position of mayor of Brussels.<br>
<br>
His name later appeared in the X-files in the Dutroux case. The investigating judge Jean-Marc Connerotte had offered witnesses the opportunity to testify anonymously, by noting their official report with an X and a number. Vanden Boeynants is mentioned by witnesses X1, X2 and X3 as being involved in serious sexual abuse and murder of children. In total there were more than 60 X witnesses. Many of them mentioned names of high-ranking persons, including members of the Belgian royal family.<br>
<br>
The investigating judge Connerotte who investigated the network around Dutroux was replaced by Jacques Langlois, who started from the 'single perpetrator theory'. After four years of investigation into the Dutroux case, the X-files were separated from the official criminal file and placed in the Dutroux-bis file . This file-bis contained not only the official reports of the X-witnesses, but also the hair samples and other forensic material, which did not belong to one of the six known victims of Dutroux, but which were never further investigated.<br>
<br>
After an eight-year criminal investigation, Marc Dutroux was sentenced to life imprisonment and the Dutroux case was closed for good. He would have mainly acted alone. However, the vast majority of the Belgian people think that Marc Dutroux was indeed part of a larger network. At least 30 witnesses who could have testified in the Dutroux case died under suspicious circumstances.</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">The beginning of the 'healing journey'</span></strong><br>
<br>
After Anneke Lucas finally manages to escape the elite pedo network and frees herself from her family, she ends up in Los Angeles and later New York after many wanderings. There, she is provoked by frightening flashbacks and begins the process of years of therapy and processing to heal her childhood traumas. She refutes the suggestion that therapists messed up her memories. “On the contrary, if there was a problem with therapists, it was that they were not open to all my experiences and put up walls as soon as I ventured into my mother's dark side, or extreme abuse.”<br>
<br>
Many victims of satanic ritual abuse or organized abuse in an elite pedo network are not only confronted with disbelief, but also risk ridicule and counter-attacks that make them insane. For that reason alone, it is brave that she nevertheless comes out with her story. In addition, the book provides insight into the dark side of the current power system, an endless cycle of victims who become perpetrators and force new victims into perpetration, in a world of perverse turns, blackmail, threats and a stifling culture of fear.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">------------------------------------------</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Normalizing pedophilia is part of a larger plan to centralize power and control people, conceived and pushed through by emotionally infantile psychopaths who would rather brainwash the entire population to imitate them than face their own childhood traumas.”</em><br>

<br>
Anneke Lucas has also managed to transcend the horrors of her childhood trauma, partly thanks to the practice of yoga and is therefore an enormous source of inspiration. She founded the organization Liberation Prison Yoga in 2014 , which provides trauma-conscious yoga training to inmates, prison staff and people whose lives are affected by incarceration. She also works for victims of abuse , especially survivors of organized child sexual abuse. She initiated a petition in 2017 to introduce legislation to combat human trafficking in hotels in upstate New York. In the same year she gave a TedTalk 'From Child Sex Slavery to Victory – My Healing Journey'. Her English-language book 'Quest for love – Memoir of a Child Sex Slave' is available to order from Amazon.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong">Anneke Lucas: An insider's testimony on the Belgian pedophile network</strong></span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Among the testimonies to read if you want to understand what is going on in the minds of children who are victims of sexual violence and sadism, those who are victims of networks of crazy people, that of Anneke Lucas is essential. It is a violent book, about an 11-year-old girl who has become an adult despite herself, a piece of the puzzle of the Belgian, European, and certainly global deep state.</strong><br>
<br>
This book is the story of a trauma, of the successive shocks suffered by this little girl that her mother projected into the gloomy evenings of high school, as they say, because she dreamed of having her place there. His daughter was the currency of exchange for a vague consideration, no more and no less than that of a child pimp. <br>
<br>
Silence resounds in any book: that of the adults who were there and participated, that of the adults who surrounded it and saw nothing, that of the complicit adults who asked no questions in front of this bizarre and demonstrative couple, of a child 11-year-old and a 21-year-old hooligan-looking young guy...<br>
<br>
We had already spoken of the story of Anneke Lucas, who was one of the many victims of the Belgian pedophile network, that of Dutroux, that of Nihoul and Vanden Boyenants. But the purpose of this story is first to show the extent of the destruction, and how it all happens without anyone seeing anything, saying anything.<br>
<br>
The book is called " Quest for love- Memoir of a child sex slave ", and it is published now (in English, notice to French publishers!) because people seem more ready to hear and understand the workings of these networks that infiltrate and corrupt our political and economic systems, and ultimately society as a whole. “ <em class="text-italics">Many more stories can never be told because the victims are dead</em> ,” explains the author.<br>
<br>
We understand that this is also why Anneke Lucas had the courage to write, rewrite and publish this book which is also a form of justice for these children whom she saw massacred before her eyes by the psychopaths of the high, those of the network which is supposed not to exist (we will note on this subject the last absolutely inept documentary diffused by Arte in which it is not even a question of the file bis , that of the network which was patiently suppressed).<br>
<br>
Because for those who follow me here, let's not forget the official version: Dutroux, Lelièvre and Martin were isolated predators and Nihoul had nothing to do with the kidnappings of minors. Necessarily: Nihoul was the pivot of the organization of certain orgies, in contact at the same time with Vanden Boyenants and the main consumers of the network, and with the providers of children. It was therefore especially not necessary that he be involved. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">" Elite pedophilia is the world's best kept secret "</em></strong><br>
<br>
<img src="https://p7.storage.canalblog.com/72/61/362748/131520222.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Anneke Lucas explains how this network then attracted pimp mothers, the relays of the network like the cleaning lady who took her there first, and other young mobsters, functioning like a giant lark mirror. So many people are involved on so many levels that to preserve this omerta which lasts again and again requires a real system of corruption. " <em class="text-italics">Those who do what they do to be elite are the most lost, emotionally immature, broken, and demonic among us</em> ," she wrote. <br>
<br>
She describes the behavior of people who on stage displayed themselves as notables beyond suspicion and behind the scenes raped and tortured children often going so far as to kill them, all in the most perfect sadism. Are we surprised that the society we live in is upside down? That the values ​​are reversed? That the masses are perceived and treated more and more like cattle?<br>
<br>
If we want to understand, diving into the functioning of these networks is unfortunately necessary. It is beyond imagination: even in my worst nightmares I could not have invented the scenes described by Anneke Lucas and other victims of nerd networks.<br>
<br>
And these people have a storefront, these people have responsibilities and direct US, and these people live in the most perfect impunity because most citizens do not want to see. It's much easier to consider it rantings, isn't it. <br>
<br>
Anneke Lucas recounts how her mother, more or less behind her stepfather's back, took her to "evenings" for pay but above all to make herself look good to local aristocrats, totally involved in this network and practicing pedocrime and incest for generations, as the author explains. His mother was an absolutely hateful character, superficial, " <em class="text-italics">dead inside</em> " as Anneke Lucas writes.<br>
<br>
As a child, she knew that the more personalities there were at these "evenings", the greater the danger. The insecurity was enormous, haunting, permanent. At every second during these orgies, everything could get out of hand in horror.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://p9.storage.canalblog.com/94/85/362748/131520237_o.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
The boss of the network and the orgies was "Polo": Paul Vanden Boeynants, who had been Prime Minister and was then Defense Minister. The facts take place between 1972 and 1974, when Anneke had already been in the network for 3 or 4 years. The only problems VDB has had as it was called in the media are proceedings for tax evasion. Yet it was Polo who was the conductor of the tortures, who showed himself to be the most sadistic.<br>
<br>
Anneke Lucas explains that he used these "evenings" to invite certain political figures or businessmen with whom he negotiated contracts, and that she herself served as a "gift" during the negotiation of arms contracts, notably. Orgies could also be organized to support or cover various businesses. Nihoul has also been convicted several times for fraud.<br>
<br>
The network was pyramidal and international: Polo himself was the beneficiary of the largesse of an even more powerful type at the international level, who was a real Satanist to him. There were connections with many countries, Anneke was brought to Germany, the United States or Switzerland in particular.<br>
<br>
As for Nihoul, he had therefore been in the network since the beginning of the 1970s and “ <em class="text-italics">quickly made himself indispensable as the intermediary between child victims, pimps, pedophiles and Polo</em> ” specifies Anneke Lucas. And the description she makes of this obsequious individual, the way he expresses himself, correspond perfectly to the Nihoul who we have seen regularly lamenting his fate in the media. Now he is dead, I wish him the return of crank elsewhere since the Belgian "justice" was unable to do anything.<br>
<br>
The children were provided by madam mothers, in the literal sense, like that of Anneke, that of Regina Louf, young crooks who went to look for children in precarious or unstable families, or even aristocrats: " <em class="text-italics">I never I saw busy men bringing their own children to orgies. But aristocrats consider sex with their children part of their culture, and had no qualms about exposing their children to their depraved rites,</em> " Anneke Lucas told The Daily Mail. about the aristocrats she met in this network. In these orgies, the little aristos acted as hosts and sexual prey.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Brainwashing and conditioning</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="https://p8.storage.canalblog.com/85/73/362748/131520247_o.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
A whole part of the book deals with the psychological aspect, difficult to grasp, of this violence. Anneke Lucas speaks of "brainwashing", of training that she was subjected to in Germany with politicians raised in the network. She was thus trained to put aside her hopes, her emotions, to look dead inside. <br>
<br>
It is this, she explains, which gave her this mature side so sought after by predators, because it allowed them to forget that it was a child they were attacking. But this training did not work as well as expected on Anneke, because she still had positive emotions despite the dark delusions of the members of this network. What probably helped save her, however, is that she managed, at 9, 10, 11, to play double game. <br>
<br>
The training also taught him to kill on command, without asking questions. Young Anneke's brain was constantly on standby, almost in turmoil at the most critical moments.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://p6.storage.canalblog.com/62/58/362748/131520250.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
She had to understand what the psychopaths wanted, and not what they said, while not showing that she had her lucidity. The strength she had left that others didn't had was that at one point she thought she had the right to be loved.<br>
<br>
There was a gradation in horror and violence, during her first steps in the network around 6 years old she was sent for weekends to a couple of pedos and they started by showing her the corpse of a young woman who had been tortured. Then her mother took her to the orgies herself, always pretending nothing had happened on the way back, even seeing her 10 or 11-year-old daughter as a rival in terms of sex appeal and relationship network.<br>
<br>
The first acts of violence were intended to make her understand that she was worthless in the network, that she could be killed with or without reason.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://p1.storage.canalblog.com/14/60/362748/131520286_o.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
In her memory, it had become a reflex for her to know how to satisfy men sexually, to know what practices they would like.<br>
<br>
The goal was for her to be able to get them to talk and repeat everything to the one who "possessed" her, a high member of the network who molded her into a show biz star sex slave, able to seduce powerful men and bring in their secrets to its "owner".<br>
<br>
His career was mapped out. A ceremony that began with a "performance" in front of handpicked relatives of the great chef, stars, intellectuals, "the cream of the network", was even organized. “ <em class="text-italics">The next part of the event brought me face to face with the terrible price I will have to pay for this fame, an action to seal my place in the secret cult of the global elites. Even though I was not yet 10 , and even though I had no choice but to carry out this action, I realized that it was too high a price to pay</em> ”, writes Anneke Lucas.<br>
<br>
That weekend, Anneke had to apply her training with political figures.<br>
<br>
The children in the network were "trained" to become true little sadists. During a party, Nihoul showed them how to cut, nick, skin to do the most harm. He also organized a meal where the remains of the victims were served to the children to terrorize them, and also to punish Anneke for having told someone after two days of violence without eating that she was hungry.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://p4.storage.canalblog.com/48/42/362748/131520300_o.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Beyond the constant criticism and belittlement, suicidal impulses had been implanted in her during a special training session abroad, where Anneke recalls being tied to a medical table in a laboratory, with two guys in lab coats. white woman performing sex acts and Polo yelling at her over and over that she didn't deserve to live if a man let her down.<br>
<br>
And that is what happened, in fact automatically, in these circumstances.<br>
<br>
The relationship she had with a 21-year-old, Patrick, also shows the perversity of this environment. Pedophile, violent, he himself had been the victim of his father and mother. Anneke was 11 years old, and this "love story" which could not be one nevertheless allowed Anneke to leave the network.<br>
<br>
It was by threatening her with death at a party that Polo was able to force Patrick to work for him in exchange for Anneke's life. Patrick, who warned her of the dark hours that Belgium was going through and urged her to leave the country as soon as she could, was this robber whose name comes up in the case of the Brabant killings, Patrick Haemers. <br>
<br>
This book is violent because we glimpse the state of helplessness in which Anneke and the other children were. We also understand to what extent a child is capable of adapting to everything, even the unimaginable. Of course the physical and psychological wounds remain, but these children, from the outside, could seem normal although a little sad for some.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://p4.storage.canalblog.com/43/90/362748/131520208_o.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
The path covered by Anneke Lucas, which was complicated, is impressive. For several years she has been denouncing the development of prostitution of minors, bringing what she can to those who need it with yoga in particular, talking about her story... This book is courageous, also for introspection and hindsight that he needed. It took quite a long way to write a book that exposes both the mechanisms of control and conditioning.<br>
<br>
Beyond helping to establish the truth about the "network" aspect of the Dutroux affair, this book is above all a document that sheds light on the functioning of certain elites whose names are not mentioned but who occupy key positions in the society, ogres who devour childhood. Anneke Lucas also makes a call through this book to pay attention to the world these people shape for us, and ultimately to cultivate human values ​​such as freedom and empathy.<br>

Two months later - bizarre story breaks, involved are Podesta brothers, James Alefantis, and yes, Maccoby as well..how strange.<br>

			<div class="content">There's a strange information going on on the internet for some time about Anneke Lucas, that she accused David Rockefeller, a person in Epstein's Black Book. Didn't wrote about it before because I've had no context for it to my previous research. Now I have.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As far as I've heard, her alleged falsification came to light after a group of people (again, from Belgium and the Netherlands) wanted to make a film about her, but started raising suspicions about some shifts, contradictions and extreme bizarre oddness in her story, <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">including stories like being trafficked by David Rockefeller</span></strong> (her "father figure"), and that in 1972 organs were taken out of her body by a Nazi eugenics doctor in Germany. All this led these people to harbor doubts in her. Made up terms such as "eugenics of sex" in her blog (she deleted this later!) led some more people, as I know, to harbor doubts in her some more.</div></blockquote>

Unlike the author I am not going to comment on credibility of these alleged accusations but I will examine connections ...<br>

What I found strange is that David's son, David Rockefeller Jr - is husband of Susan Rockefeller - who is close friends with Nora Maccoby. We know that Lucas and Nora know each other since 1991 - according to Maccoby's own words [ <a href="https://archive.ph/6XjJF/b5ea78643fb0581fe94b98efcb556794669bf2d9.png" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/6XjJF/b5ea78643fb058 ... 9bf2d9.png</a> + <a href="https://archive.ph/ZsqSK" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/ZsqSK</a> + <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5684#p5684" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5684#p5684</a> + <a href="https://washingtonlife.smugmug.com/2012PHOTOS/Resilience-Gala-Pen-Faulkner/i-C2HC7Jn/A" class="postlink">https://washingtonlife.smugmug.com/2012 ... -C2HC7Jn/A</a> ]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The year of 1969 was a very crucial one for what has been called the “Cercle complex”. Several key Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) were established, which involved influential men in their private capacities, who were also often members of, or connected to, Le Cercle. It has been suspected, based on a photo, that <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Baron de Bonvoisin attended Le Cercle as far back as 1968, where he apparently can be seen meeting with David Rockefeller</span></strong> and Antoine Pinay, although de Bonvoisin certainly attended once in 1982. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">It was on April 3, 1969, that the Cercle des Nations was set up by Paul Vankerkhoven, Paul Vanden Boeynants, Baron de Bonvoisin and Florimond Damman, all of whom would appear in an Opus Dei dossier.</span></strong> All four of these men later on became members of the Academie Europeene des Sciences Politique (AESP), which was founded in January 1969. Another organization set up in 1961 was the Mouvement pour l’Union de l’Europe (MAUE), which was the Belgian branch of the Paneuropa Union (PEU). Many of these organizations involved members with links to Opus Dei, an organization that was active in Belgium going back to at the latest 1965. At some point, it is highly suspected that Vanden Boeynants and de Bonvoisin became members of Opus Dei, including others close to them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anneke Lucas<br>
By 1969, a newer victim-witness has come forward claiming she was seemingly targeted by a Countess (living in Antwerp) and then groomed, sexualized, abused and then taken by a couple to a castle, when she was six years old. A large man greeted them, but he was upset that the pimps had only brought three girls and no boys. Other aristocrats were present and horrible, humiliating, things were done to Anneke. At one point, Anneke was led down a cellar where she was shown a dead body of a teenage girl, as a warning that she would end up dead if she spoke out about the Network. Anneke was taken by the couple to orgies where child abuse took place, but, eventually her own mother began taking her to these places. Even though Anneke still went to school, if she was absent there was always a doctor to write a note. According to Anneke it was clear that Vanden Boeynants and his associates were running everything. It appears that around the 1969-1970 period, Anneke was sent in a car with a seven year old boy and driven by two handlers to Switzerland. After arrival, they were led into a long underground tunnel with burning torches on the walls. At the end of the tunnel they met with other handlers. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Then an American that spoke French</span></strong> came out and decided that the boy would be sacrificed. This was described by Anneke, which was extremely traumatic for her, as a Satanic Ritual sacrifice. It took place in a large underground area with symbols on the floor, burning fires, an alter, men dressed in black robes and hoods. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">A Belgian lawyer and eventual Baron was present and had the role of executioner. That Belgian was close to Vanden Boeynants, who had apparently sent Anneke and the boy as a gift to the American. After a precarious event this unnamed American thought Anneke was sophisticated and decided to have her flown to the United States in July. This American took her with him to his properties and showed her off to some of his friends. Eventually he began rejecting her, having her sent back to Switzerland. It appears that it was Vanden Boeynants himself who picked her up in Switzerland and then drove her to Germany.</span></strong> She was taken to a facility, which was sort of mind control, training and eugenics clinic. Anneke was strapped down, tested, injected and brainwashed. At one point, it appears that VDB yelled in her ear that she should commit suicide if the American rejects her. Anneke was trained to pick up on facial features that would indicate certain sexual preferences. The main doctor at the facility was a Nazi, who was funded by the American. Most unnerving is that Anneke was the oldest child there, most were toddlers and babies. Afterwards, Anneke would be taken back to Germany to service VIPs. Eventually, Anneke would meet the American in Germany, where he would reject her for the last time. Despite this, Anneke had a reputation in the Network and was used by Vanden Boeynants to service VIPs.</div></blockquote>

Focus on American who spoke French. It so happens that David Rockefeller spoke fluent French:<br>

All these people were once named as "DC Illuminati" (lol) in article about Transformer DC auction made by their associate Dana Ellyn:<br>

I wonder what connects all these people huh? Especially Russian disinfo Oliver Stone. Why is Sean Stone and Oliver Stone so close with Nora Maccoby? Or maybe they just pretend to be "Russian disinfo" and thus destroying credibility of alternative movements? Such theory would fit narrative of authors like ISGP who is mentioning Oliver Stone under "liberal CIA": <br>

Here's what she says about Pizzagate and James Alefantis on 21st November 2016, according to her he's not running a pedo ring. I'm sorry Ms Nora but everything points to different direction so far.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"the pizza gate" is a witch hunt, specifically targeted along political lines. Comet Ping Pong is not hosting baby eating cabals in tunnels underneath the building. this is total and complete bull**** concocted by Steve Bannon/Paul Manafort trolls. Wake the **** up people. This is increasingly a mob mentality. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">James Alefentis is yes, gay and parties, but he's not running a pedo ring.</span></strong> He's an easy mark. This discredits the alternative news community more than I have ever witnessed. It discredits the work that goes on daily to combat child trafficking.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Here's another one:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I am certainly NOT in denial. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have been assisting, researching, and writing about efforts to stop child trafficking since 2004. It's going on, no question.</span></strong> But making a witch hunt from doctored photos and emails, using the mass public to judge - is appalling. The context of this particular "discovery" is highly political, there are innocent people that I personally know involved and now countless death threats against people who are a seen as "collateral". Using the MOB on the INTERNET to DESTROY people WITHOUT A TRIAL is WRONG. Child trafficking MUST be stopped. This is NOT how you do it.</div></blockquote>

And another one:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I AM NOT A JUDGE OR A JURY. I deeply resent people who live behind screens using unsubstantiated data to destroy lives and commerce at MOB RULE. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I live in Washington DC and I know what I know by first hand experience.

I KNOW that many of the Wikileaks are compromised and constructed. I KNOW that Russian intelligence has used Assange as their message boy and they have agendas. The election is NOT OVER.<br>
<br>
AS FOR THE QUESTIONS BELOW:<br>
I'm not a private investigator. I am overwhelmed by the level of disinformation on the internet. All I know is what I know first hand, as I said. I am not a Clinton fan. I know Epstein is a pimp to the rich in both parties. As for pedophilia as a "thing" in DC....I'm sure it's happening but I have never seen it and I've lived here almost half a century. I do know it has no party affiliation and seems to transcend class, race, ethnicity and gender. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have friends who have survived assassination attempts for their work to stop it</span></strong>. There are many brave people out there working to rescue children. If you want to help, you can contact me.

Another one, here she talks about her friend Aaron Cohen who is underage sex slave retriever. She also mentions Innocents at Risk, organization she and her sister Izette are associated with. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The networks are run by ruthless gangster mobs and the demand continues to grow. The law enforcement teams working on this are risking their lives every day. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I have a friend who is a slave retriever, goes into bordellos and rescues the children, and he has survived over 6 assassination attempts. Not everyone is so lucky.</span></strong> The trafficking spiraled out of control after 911 due largely to the internet. Efforts with protocol of witnessing trafficking in action on buses, trains, planes, has saved thousands of children. There are a lot of organizations out there that are doing actual WORK to face this and deal with it. Innocents at Risk is an awareness organization that has actually done a lot to get different agencies to work collaboratively and more effectively.<br>

btw - it's extremely hard these days to discern real news from fake news. The pizza gate was an alarm bell as it is in my literal backyard and directly in my life and really smart people were convinced of certain "facts" <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">that I know for FACT are FALSE</span></strong>. The war we are in right now is perception, information, and psychological. This article should be mandatory reading for all well intentioned internet users of "news":<br>

What is false for certain? No family connection, no friendship, nothing should make one blind and incapable to investigate this.<br>

Another post of her, on topic of Pizzagate:<br>

And no, this isn't about "pizza" unless we talk "secret pizza" and pedophile sadist 'art taste' ( <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=11796#p11796" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.p ... 796#p11796</a> + <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2687" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2687</a> ) of J'aime les Enfants otherwise known as James Alefantis, also, look how she quoted no police and no FBI investigation, because there's none to quote:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Onawah, "supportive of the public's attempts to get involved and help"....do you get involved in police investigations? <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">does it help to promote conspiracies based on doctored emails and photos that have no relationships</span></strong>? Remember when witches were burned at the stake? That was the "public" doing its job to stop the bad women. This is the same. I have never publicly had to defend anyone against false accusations but in this situation I have been gobsmacked.<br>
<br>
Now you want to call me out? Are you a detective? You want the public to do something? <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">You realize that the Police AND the FBI have investigated and found that this is a manipulated political hate crime directed at James. This is about pizza, not babies. </span></strong> That video clip somebody posted of a young woman "putting it all together" ...if that's your proof, my god, have mercy on your soul. Reality check: people do talk about "doing pizza" because it is a meeting point for many of us to yes, "eat pizza and hang out". <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">James is an incredible chef. He has 2 restaurants next to each other and there is a great book store. the whole block is a place where people come together and the language has nothing to do with babies being eaten.</span></strong><br>

As for taking off where Wikileaks left off - Wiki has been a direct messaging source for Russian intelligence. Their mission was to destroy Hilary by any means necessary.

Emails are clearly not doctored so aren't the photos. Even the DCLeaks who are directly accused of being Russian agents released legit emails, just take James Alefantis/Tony Podesta/Catherine Chieco/Leslie Dach visit at Venice Biennale where friend of Podesta - Abramovic - cooperates with alleged child trafficker and pedophile Axel Vervoordt. There's proven connection between James Alefantis Instagram pictures locations and those emails.<br>

It's simple. If investigation is too much for someone to handle - it's ok but at least don't dismiss like this, if you are innocent though and attacks on your family were the reason why you dismissed this, that's not ok.

Nora Maccoby and her husband Todd loved to peddle conspiracy theories about illuminati and freemasons and reality being controlled experiment. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">So what about us asking questions about them now</span></strong>.<br>
<br>
Here some user on Avalon where Nora and Todd were active is outing Nora and Todd as being "defensive, by means of over the top counter attacks":<br>

			<div class="content">This topic already contains proof that Todd Hathaway was on Facebook (where he once mentioned ominous <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Operation Dionysus</span></strong>) and Gab ( <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=12636#p12636" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.p ... 636#p12636</a> ). This time I will mention some strange interaction I've had on Gab with account named Nora Pandora which btw is a pro Q account which is funny btw because Nora Maccoby claims her friends were discussing creating Q:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>She also claims her friends are into creating Q?<br>

<a href="https://gab.com/NoraPandora" class="postlink">https://gab.com/NoraPandora</a><br>
<br>
This account basically followed me and I've thought it is maybe just a little strange as I write a lot about person named Nora. So I've made a security question and asked that user about Anneke Lucas. Then this account basically disappeared (activity wise) and is not active since then.<br>
<br>
Here there are screenshots, I've asked this question on April 1st 2022 and the last activity of the user ends on the same date. The user obviously did not answer me.<br>

<br>
Also if you look at the user's Gab description there's a quote of Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt. Nora Maccoby Hathaway quoted the same philosopher on her Facebook profile in the past:<br>

Just a strange little interaction I've had. If this is true then it is funny what is happening on those social media platforms and forums.</div>

Sean Stone, you sound like a shill here, not to a point of dismissing Pizzagate but pretty close? Listen to this guys, especially second half. 31:00 and 50:20<br>

As always I will try to not judge but this guys father is too sympathetic to foreign commies as well as defending domestic perverts (Weinstein) and Sean himself sounded pretty troubled when discussing Pizzagate, and he knows Nora Maccoby before this whole thing started.

Sean Stone has a history of almost dismissing initial allegations because of connections to his friend Nora Maccoby, and then promoting paywalled documentaries and talking about reptiles all that while being connected to Sacha Stone who on the other hand is good friends with Orsini who is alleged founder of Nights Of St Francis which is secret society focused on sex parties, orgies and occultism:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A similar club like SNCTM is Nights Of St Francis (NOSF), a secret society that also organizes elite sex parties. They present themselves as the Freemasons and make all kinds of references to the Illuminati, the film Eyes Wide Shut, satanism and rituals on their website and social media. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Nights Of St. Francis was founded by Ciro Orsini, the co-founder of the ITNJ</span></strong> (International Tribunal of Natural Justice). The ITNJ says they stand up for victims of sexual exploitation or ritual abuse.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The same players are involved in both Ciro Orsini’s business activities and Sacha Stone’s organizations. Ciro and Sacha have known each other for decades and have done many things together. The question therefore is, what Sacha Stone knew about Ciro Orsini’s business activities and whether he did not find it inappropriate to involve him (nevertheless) in the founding of ITNJ and Humanitad’s projects.</div></blockquote>

Sadly Liz Croking contradicted herself by saying that Pizzagate is not a Jewish thing but somehow Epstein is Jewish and at the center of Pizzagate (according to her) So which is it… I only hope it is unfortunate tweet because overall I support her efforts.<br>

Pizzagate is however entirely Jewish families involved in highely esoteric and twisted interpretations of their religion.<br>

From Luzzattos to Maccobys to Cafritzes to Bronfmans to Rothschilds to Epstein to Maxwell and even to Freud family (Maddie McCann case) they are all Jewish which needs to be said.<br>

But what is even more rare is connection between Anne Applebaum, wife of Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Radoslaw Sikorski, and Nora Maccoby. They grew up in the same neighborhood, attended same school, socialized together as adults with Nora’s sister Annie Maccoby who is on the other hand married to Swedish banker and economist Erik Berglof. Sikorski and Applebaum attended Bilderberg meeting in Stockholm last few days.<br>
