<br>
<br>
Momentum and Evidence Suggest Surfside Is a Deflection Point Construct<br>
<br>
There is plenty of momentum and accumulating evidence to suggest that the South Tower collapse at the Champlain complex in Surfisde is a constructed event serving as a deflection point away from the truth about the stolen 2020 election ain the full public spectrum and beginning with the forensic audit results in Maricopa County. Initially, the Arizona audit results were incorrectly rumored to start being released this past Monday causing one to ask if perhaps that was deliberate misinformation/disinformation tactic devised to result in a tipped hand.  No matter, the results are now loosely slated for the beginning of August. Until then, the Surfside story will continue to be developed and crafted in the MSM to detract and occupy headlines.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you haven’t seen the Surfside video and the article,  both are necessary for appropriate contextual backdrop  because it is very big picture but with granular details drawing back to China and the CCP.<br>
<br>
Given our established fact set following the first article and video.  This will help frame the direction of this article, which vectors-off in several directions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MOMENTUM<br>
<br>
Let’s begin with political momentum; and for good reason.<br>
<br>
First, remember one of our longstanding principles in all things statecraft – investigations are opened for two primary reasons: 1) to reveal the truth, present the evidence and prosecute the offenders -or- 2) to conceal the truth, seal away the evidence and protect the offenders. This is especially true when questionable events have specific political purpose and value, such as capitalizing on tragedy and death as a deflection point away from a stolen presidential election.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With these givens, is anyone really surprised that Biden is both visiting Surfside and calling for a FEDERAL investigation into the South Tower collapse. Of course not.<br>
<br>
The political momentum here presents as 1) Joe Biden making a personal visit to Surfside and 2) Biden’s call for an official (federal) investigation into the collapse. It’s a simple as saying Biden is going to leverage the construct precisely as we’re alleging; that he will have the evidence enveloped, sealed away and then explained away in the investigative report.<br>
<br>
In short, the political momentum here is a rehash of the following image – just reduce the size and add a column to the right for Surfside. Pro-tip, make it real small and add a bunch of columns to the right to accommodate what is hopefully in the pipe circa August.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Even worse, it doesn’t appear as if Surfisde’s HOA has an interest in arriving at the truth given this from MSN.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With Biden dragging-in the FBI and the NIST for the cover-up, Surfside’s hiring of KCE is troubling for all of the obvious reasons. Is Surfside chipping-in on Joe Biden’s pile? Who is making these decisions for Surfside? Why isn’t Surfside’s full slate of HOA members featured on its home page? Who is the president of the HOA? Who hired KCE and why? How does Becker &amp; Poliakoff factor into decisions made as the co-managing partner? Why is that every time attorneys are involved, the truth is the furthest thing from reach?<br>
<br>
EVIDENCE<br>
<br>
Our discussion here really focuses on two primary components but the waters get real murky very fast: ownership and management. We’re murky already because ownership and management are enmeshed at Surfside and with a homeowner’s association (HOA) and law and accounting firms entangled and situated in between.<br>
<br>
One of the troubling aspects in the initial work here was actually identifying the owner/s of the Champlain complex. Interestingly, generic terms like “the owners” were generally used in the early reporting. Subsequently, we have identified the owner’s as drawing back on a 2014 timeline.<br>
<br>
From Zero Hedge and immediately beginning with controversy (emphasis mine),<br>
<br>
Champlain Towers developer Nathan Reiber, who died in 2014, was once accused of paying off local officials to sidestep a construction moratorium in Surfside in 1979 because of problems with the sewer system, according to WaPo. <br>
<br>
Reiber had “contributed” to the campaigns of local officials that granted him preferential treatment when it came to building Champlain Towers South in 1981. <br>
<br>
WaPo noted all the principals involved in the design and construction of the building are deceased. Former construction companies that played a role in the construction of Champlain Towers were unwilling to talk about the building collapse. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, part of the Department of Commerce, is the federal agency that investigated the collapse of the twin towers, sent one of its engineers, Fahim Sadek, to Champlain Towers North, a couple of blocks away from the southern tower, to examine basement area and try to piece together the complex puzzle of why the building collapsed. <br>
<br>
We noted two reports that were recently completed on Champlain South. The first was a field study conducted by an engineering firm in 2018 that identified structural damage to concrete slabs under the pool deck and cracking and crumbling in the parking garage. However, there was no evidence of imminent collapse. The second was a study from 2020 that outlined the tower was sinking in the 1990s by 2 millimeters a year.  <br>
<br>
The condo building was already conducting its 40-year recertification repair at the time of the collapse on early Thursday morning. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
$15mm? I commented on this notion in the first article by asking, “whether this plagued building with documented structural integrity concerns dating back to the 1990s was hand selected to fall at a precise and needed time; and whether there may be a line of connections and nexuses from one end of our rope to the other and thus supportive such a notion.”<br>
<br>
Surfside was as ripe a piece of fruit as it could be to be selectively plucked for controlled demolition. Did the Deep State (intelligence community) pluck it? My nickel is on the affirmative.<br>
<br>
Adding to the existing and documented financial strain plaguing Surfside’s ownership, the building also maintained 30% vacancy and likely had trouble eliminating it due to economic conditions, COVID-19 and the full scope of Surfside’s structural problems.<br>
<br>
I’m betting the financials for this place are horrendous ergo the portal for fraud. Knowing who manages those financials is critical as will be determining if there any compromising interfaces (intelligence community?).<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, Surfside’s long and well-known history of structural integrity issues had the South Tower facing upwards of $15mm worth of repairs, as reported by MSN. This causes me to feel uncomfortable learning that the building collapsed after its “40-year recertification repair” work had begun, but not before the really, really, really expensive repairs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Notable above is the entanglement and conflicting reports derived from Morabito Consultants, which is our draw back to D.C. from the first article. Also recall and as mentioned above that Champlain is co-managed by the HOA and the law firm Becker &amp; Poliakoff.<br>
<br>
Becker is important because it features the star of the first article – our Chinese-born, CCP cookie-cut-out premier attorney, who serves as the chairwoman of the Asian Financial Society, which is a functionary of China’s One Belt, One Road doctrine and a patented CCP outfit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Surfside HOA president Jean Wodnicki advised residents that the structural integrity concerns call for an expedited timeline and placed the repairs at $15mm. This abuts to the June hiring of Morabito Consultants. Wonicki also passed the buck by saying, “A lot of this work could have been done or planned for in years gone by…But this is where we are now.”<br>
<br>
This is an important distinction. Does it sound like Wonicki was well apprised of the full scope of Surfside’s problems or is she getting news and stomping on the gas? Is she playing coy to save her own ass or is it that there is a need for an expedited timeline based upon information received in close proximity to her April advisement? Did she know all along? Were Becker &amp; Poliakoff representatives fully transparent with the HOA and did Wonicki and the board know everything they knew? What exactly did each know and when did they know it? Overlaying those two timelines could be very revealing if we could build and evidence them both accurately.<br>
