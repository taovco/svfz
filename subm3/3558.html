			<div class="content">The following story is going to blow up and lead to the Bill Gates/ Epstein network.. and we had it here first..<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">Judicial Watch: New HHS Documents Reveal Millions in Federal Funding for University of Pittsburgh Human Fetal Organ Harvesting Project Including Viable and Full-Term Babies </span><a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-releases/hhs-documents-organ-harvesting/" class="postlink">https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-rel ... arvesting/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>(Washington, DC) Judicial Watch and The Center for Medical Progress (CMP) announced today that they received 252 pages of new documents from the US Department of Health and Human Services that reveal nearly $3 million in federal funds were spent on the University of Pittsburgh’s quest to become a “Tissue Hub” for human fetal tissue ranging from 6 to 42 weeks gestation. <br>
<br>
These documents were obtained as part of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit in which Judicial Watch represents CMP and is suing HHS after it failed to respond to an April 28, 2020, FOIA request seeking among other things, the grant applications for a University of Pittsburgh “tissue hub and collection site.” (Center for Medical Progress v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (No. 1:21-cv-00642)).<br>
<br>
The documents reveal the following:<br>
<br>
    The aims of the project listed in the original 2015 proposal were to “develop a pipeline to the acquisition, quality control and distribution of human genitourinary [urinary and genital organs and functions] samples obtained throughout development (6-42 weeks gestation). … [and] generate an ongoing resource to distribute fresh developmental human genitourinary samples from various stages (6-42 weeks) to the GUDMAP [GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project] Atlas projects.”<br>
<br>
    In the proposal, Pitt notes that is has been “collecting fetal tissue for over 10 years … include[ing] liver, heart, gonads, legs, brain, genitourinary tissues including kidneys, ureters and bladders.”<br>
<br>
    Pitt noted in 2015 “we have disbursed over 300 fresh samples collected from 77 cases. The collections can be significantly ramped up as material could have been accrued from as many as 725 cases last year.”<br>
<br>
    The Health Sciences Tissue Bank at Pitt is “embedded within the Department of Pathology … thus providing rapid access to very high quality tissue and biological specimens.”<br>
<br>
    Pitt boasts it has a number of internal connections as well as a “strong working relationship with UPMC [University of Pittsburgh Medical Center] and the Department of Pathology” as well as three “laboratories in the flagship UPMC hospitals.” This includes a lab boasting a “ButcherBoy band saw for sectioning bone,” and a “frozen section room has digital video feed to and from the operating rooms. This also allows for instantaneous discussions with the surgeons as well [as] immediate ‘show and tell’ for them.” The proposal ironically also boasts about the laboratories at the “Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.” <br>
<br>
    Later in the proposal, Pitt states that it records the “warm ischemic time on our samples and take steps to keep it at a minimum to ensure the highest quality biological specimens.” [The “warm ischemic time” refers to the amount of time an organ remains at body temperature after blood supply has been cut off.  Warm ischemic time differs from cold ischemic time which refers to amount of time the organ is chilled.  Pitt’s statement suggests the time between the abortion and collection is minimal.]<br>
    The Pitt scientists note that, “All fetal tissue is collected through a collaborative process including Family Planning, Obstetrics and Pathology.” And that, “the numbers of consents and collections has been steadily increasing… and we are in an excellent position to expand our services to include the needs of the GUDMAP Atlas projects.”<br>
<br>
    Pitt anticipated “being able to harvest and distribute quality tissue and cells … [and] do not anticipate any major problems related to the acquisition and distribution of the tissues.”<br>
<br>
    Pitt’s target goal “is to have available a minimum of 5 cases (tissues and if possible other biologicals) per week of gestational age for ages 6-42 weeks.”<br>
<br>
    Pitt’s proposal also included a racial target for harvesting of human fetal parts. Of its planned aborted “subjects” Pitt desired 50% to be minority fetuses. The proposal suggests that the “subjects” be diverse because Pittsburgh is diverse, the U.S. Census Bureau shows the city of Pittsburgh is close to 70% white. <br>
    Pitt’s proposal requested more than $3.2 million over a five-year period. The documents show NIH has funded at least $2.7 million so far for Pitt’s human fetal tissue harvesting and hub.<br>
<br>
In March 2021, a federal court ordered HHS to release additional information about its purchases of organs harvested from aborted human fetuses. The court also found “there is reason to question” whether the transactions violate federal law barring the sale of fetal organs.<br>
<br>
In May 2021, Judicial Watch announced it had uncovered records from the FDA showing the agency spent tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars to buy human fetal tissue from California-based Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR). The tissue was used in creating “humanized mice” to test “biologic drug products.” The records show the agency ordered shipments to be “fresh; shipped on wet ice.”<br>
<br>
In June 2020, Judicial Watch released records showing the FDA between 2012 and 2018 entered into eight contracts worth $96,370 with Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) to acquire “fresh and never frozen” tissue from 1st and 2nd trimester aborted fetuses for use in creating humanized mice for ongoing research. In February 2020, Judicial Watch made public additional humanized mice records.<br>
<br>
“These documents show taxpayer money is being used to turn the University of Pittsburgh is a one-stop human fetal tissue shop – from procuring the tissue from elective abortions, ‘subdividing’ the human remains, to distributing and shipping the harvested tissue,” stated Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. <br>
<br>

Chain of Hope links experts together around the world to bring life-saving heart treatments to children in developing and war-torn countries... Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub - President and Founder Chain of Hope..<br>
<br>
Hmm.. Magdi Yacoub worked with Hasnat Khan, the heart surgeon that Diana was in love with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/articl" class="postlink">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/articl</a> ... itain.html<br>

For some weird reason, Princess Diana was allowed into the operating room during heart surgery. <a href="http://archive.is/wip/XJQOJ" class="postlink">http://archive.is/wip/XJQOJ</a></div></blockquote>

Regarding Princess Diana and Hasnat Khan, according to a tip that Enty received, Hasnat turned out to be much more than Diana's lover.<br>

Considering the reveal, I found it curious that he more recently lived with someone who lost their brother in a terrorist bombing.  Hasnat was seen with her at the Chain of Hope Ball.  He had also taken Diana there one year I think.  It's a big celebrity event, Naomi Campbell attended in 2016.<br>

I just found this in my notes regarding Phillip Bonhoeffer (someone you've mentioned in a post <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3809794" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3809794</a> )<br>
butlincat's blog...a seeker of the truth: "BRITAIN'S DIRTY ORGAN SCANDAL" - thecolemanexperience 17 March 2016 (butlincatsblog.com)<br>
<br>
butlincatsblog.com/2016/03/britains-dirty-organ-scandal.html  (the site includes info on Chain of Hope, Princess Diana, Hasnat Khan, Magdi Yacoub and more)<br>
<br>
"The charity operates in the following countries:&nbsp;Egypt&nbsp;Ethiopia&nbsp;Gambia&nbsp;Grenada&nbsp;Iraq&nbsp;Jamaica&nbsp;Kenya&nbsp;Mozambique&nbsp;Pakistan&nbsp;Uganda&nbsp;Zimbabwe&nbsp;The charity employs Tom Narducci from the NSPCC, to act as a “children’s issues” advisor ( the NSPCC is a front organisation run by paedophiles.)&nbsp;One of the trustees of the charity was top Great Ormond Street heart specialist Professor Philipp Bonhoeffer.&nbsp;Philipp Bonhoeffer was struck off the medical register after he was found guilty of abusing boys.&nbsp;Phillip Bonhoeffer abused boys when he was working for the Chain of Hope charity in Mozambique.&nbsp;According to the Independent:&nbsp;” The former Great Ormond Street heart specialist facing allegations of sexually abusing young boys in Kenya told one of his victims that his behaviour was “normal and acceptable in Europe”, according to the charges levelled against him at a medical tribunal.&nbsp;Philipp Bonhoeffer, who was head of cardiology at the children’s hospital until 2009 and is internationally renowned as a pioneer of new treatments, is alleged to have earlier admitted to the parents of another victim that he had paedophile tendencies which he could do nothing about and he hoped the children in Kenya “would never speak of what had happened to them”.<br>
<br>
The allegations are contained in the list of charges published by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service…<br>
They include details of six children and young adults with whom he is said to have had sexual contact, shared a bed or touched inappropriately, when they were under-age or without their consent..&nbsp;The charges relate to the period from 1995 to 2008, during which Professor Bonhoeffer, now aged 50, made frequent trips to Kenya doing charitable work.&nbsp;From 2005 he travelled with the medical charity Chain of Hope, founded by heart transplant pioneer Sir Magdi Yacoub, which provides treatment to children with heart problems in the developing world.&nbsp;Professor Bonhoeffer chaired its medical board and sponsored a number of boys and youths in Kenya and paid for their education.<br>
<br>
At 3pm on 31 August 2008, Professor Bonhoeffer was found in a flat at the Mater Hospital in Nairobi by Witness Z, a representative of the Chain of Hope due to give evidence at the hearing, who was making an unannounced visit accompanied by a nurse.&nbsp;According to the charges, Professor Bonhoeffer was “in a bedroom with Kenyan male children and young male adults” to whom he had provided sponsorship and gifts.&nbsp;Photographs taken on the same day are alleged to have been found on his camera showing him next to a boy “bare chested and lying on a bed” which were “inappropriate” and “sexually motivated”.&nbsp;When the allegations first emerged, the Metropolitan Police travelled to Kenya in 2008 to investigate and interviewed witness A among other witnesses but no prosecution was brought.&nbsp;UK residents can be prosecuted for crimes against children abroad but only for those committed after May 2004.”<br>
<br>
The BBC reported:<br>
<br>
"A former Great Ormond Street Hospital cardiologist has been struck off the medical register after he was found guilty of molesting boys.<br>
Professor Philipp Bonhoeffer was ruled guilty of sexually motivated conduct by a panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service on Friday.&nbsp;Prof Bonhoeffer was found to have behaved inappropriately towards children in Kenya and a boy in France.&nbsp;The tribunal panel in Manchester decided it was proven that Prof Bonhoeffer had committed inappropriate conduct while in Kenya to undertake charitable medical work between 1993 and 2008.&nbsp;The panel heard that in 1995 during an overnight stay at a camp in Kenya, he behaved in a sexually motivated way towards a boy of 13.&nbsp;Prof Bonhoeffer was also found to have touched a 16-year-old Kenyan boy sexually, telling him such conduct was normal and acceptable in Europe.”&nbsp;<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/revealed-sex-abuse-charges-for-top-child-doctor-8118206.html" class="postlink">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/cr ... 18206.html</a></div>

Convicted ‘lord’, who mastermind Gresham Ltd scam, is thought to have raised £25m from sale of London property featured in The King’s Speech<br>
<br>
Edward “Fast Eddie” Davenport, the self-styled lord convicted in 2011 for masterminding a £4m fraud, has sold his London mansion to settle £13m of confiscation and compensation orders.<br>
<br>
Davenport’s former 24-bedroom Marylebone home, 33 Portland Place, was the house where Colin Firth’s character had speech therapy in the film The King’s Speech. It was once the Sierra Leonean high commission until Davenport controversially acquired it for a below-market sum in 1999, while the west African country was in the middle of a civil war. The latest sale is thought to have fetched around £25m.<br>
<br>
Under Davenport’s ownership, <span style="color:#FF0040">the house hosted celebrity parties and “upmarket” swingers events called <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Killing Kittens.</span></span> It has also been used as the venue for music videos including<span style="color:#FF0040"> Amy Winehouse’s Rehab, and for Kate Moss’s Agent Provocateur fashion shoot.</span><br>
<br>
Davenport was convicted along with eight others for his role in Gresham Ltd, a company that purported to offer commercial loans, for which it sought “advance fee” payments from borrowers. The firm was falsely promoted as a long-established, wealthy and prestigious financial organisation capable of lending hundreds of millions of pounds as venture capital.<br>
<br>
He was sentenced to seven years and eight months in prison in October 2011. Last year, the Serious Fraud Office’s proceeds of crime division applied for confiscation and compensation orders relating to the total benefit Davenport is believed to have derived from his schemes, rather than the £4m relating to his trial.<br>
<br>
Davenport was released last year from Wandsworth prison after having a plea for clemency granted on the grounds of ill health.</div></blockquote>

Eddie pulls a fast one! Two years after he's released from jail over ill health, 'Lord' Davenport is back hosting lucrative sex parties (and is living in a mansion across from his old one) <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3794578/Eddie-pulls-fast-one-Two-years-s-released-jail-ill-health-Lord-Davenport-hosting-lucrative-sex-parties-living-mansion-old-one.html" class="postlink">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/articl ... d-one.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He was shamed for running high society sex parties and jailed for his part in a multi-million-pound fraud.<br>
<br>
But self-styled ‘Lord’ Edward Davenport is still hosting lucrative orgies, staging them just across the road from the Central London mansion he was forced to sell.<br>
<br>
Davenport, described by the trial judge as a ‘very, very dishonest man’, was sentenced to eight years and seven months in prison in 2011 for being the ‘ringmaster’ in a £4.5 million deception...<br>
<br>
Despite his poor health, Davenport, also known as ‘Fast Eddie’, staged a sex party on Friday.<br>
<br>
The event, where women were encouraged to dress as ‘school girls’ and men as ‘headmasters’, took place at 32 Portland Place, the £30 million mansion where he lives, and was organised by Killing Kittens, the sex-party firm set up by Emma Sayle, a schoolfriend of the Duchess of Cambridge.<br>
