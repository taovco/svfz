St John Ambulance Ireland <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Ambulance_Ireland" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Ambulance_Ireland</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>St John Ambulance Ireland (SJAI), previously known as the St John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland, is a charitable voluntary organisation in Ireland. For constitutional reasons it is not a full member association of the Venerable Order of Saint John and the international St. John Ambulance movement, but rather is classed as an "associated body"...<br>
<br>
The St John Ambulance Association was established in the United Kingdom in 1877 as<span style="color:#FF0040"> a foundation of the Order of St John</span>, tasked with training the police, workers and members of the public in first aid. A centre for this purpose was established in Dublin around 1881, with a further centre being opened in Belfast in 1886...<br>
<br>
The first division founded in what was to later become the Irish Free State was the Dublin (St James's Gate) Ambulance Division, formed in 1903 at the <span style="color:#FF0040">Guinness Brewery at St. James's Gate in Dublin</span>, under the guidance of Dr (later Sir) John Lumsden. ..<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The organisation has been the subject of complaints of child sexual abuse since the 1990s.</span> In 2019, an investigation by Tusla concluded that allegations of abuse made against a former senior member were founded.[10] The judgement was upheld by an independent appeals panel in 2020, following an appeal lodged by lawyers for the abuser..</span>.<br>
<br>
Commissioners of the Brigade include: Derek L. Robinson, 1974 – June 2008<br>

DEREK ROBINSON obit <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/one-of-the-last-truly-general-surgeons-and-archetypal-sportsman-1.947003" class="postlink">https://www.irishtimes.com/news/one-of- ... n-1.947003</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Following qualification in 1946, he was a house surgeon in the Meath Hospital and joined the St John Ambulance Brigade, being appointed divisional surgeon... On his return he studied for the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, to which he was admitted in 1950. Further training followed at hospitals in England before returning to the Meath, under the tutelage of Henry Stokes, Douglas W Montgomery and Brandon Stephens...<br>
<br>
His mentor, Douglas W Montgomery, was commissioner of the St John Ambulance Brigade until his death in 1974, at which stage Derek was appointed to lead the organisation, a role he played up to his death... He was in charge of the brigade's contribution to the first aid services during the Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II in the Phoenix Park in 1979. He was close to the Papal Cross, in full uniform, during the Mass and afterwards claimed that he had probably been nearer to the pope than any other <span style="color:#FF0040">Irish freemason</span>.<br>
<br>
A member of the Masonic Order for more than 50 years, he had been admitted to the 32nd degree, at the pinnacle of the order. <span style="color:#FF0040">His mother lodge was Trinity College Dublin Lodge No 357</span>, which he attended assiduously, even in the month before his death...With the agreement of the Government, he was admitted as a Knight to the Venerable Order of the Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem and was delighted to wear the mantle of the order.<br>
<br>
..He was much engaged in societies and clubs outside medicine and golf. He was a member of the Kildare Street and University Club and of the Royal Irish Yacht Club. He was also a former president of the Hibernian Catch Club, said to be the oldest musical society in Europe.</div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Trinity’s ties to Freemasonry forge a strong heritage</span> <a href="http://trinitynews.ie/2019/11/trinitys-ties-to-freemasonry-forge-a-strong-heritage/" class="postlink">http://trinitynews.ie/2019/11/trinitys- ... -heritage/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The role played by the Freemasons in Trinity College is much more than just a matter of historical trivia, but is something that is very present and indeed essential as part of some students’ daily lives...<br>
<br>
It has often been pointed out, generally with a wary suspicion, that the Grand Lodge of Ireland (the island’s HQ for Freemasonry) is situated just footsteps away from Leinster House. Whether this location is indeed a conspiratorial hint towards the real seat of power, or just a geographical coincidence in a notoriously cramped city, the distrust held by people surrounding the Masons is a significant problem for them. Last year in response to an article highlighting the presence of two Freemason’s Lodges within Westminster, the English Freemasons took out full page advertisements defending themselves in the Daily Telegraph, the London Times, and the Guardian. Tired of the “stigma” and “discrimination” its members have faced, the Freemasons are looking to move past old associations with secret and mystery, and towards an approach that is much more open and friendly.<br>
<br>
If we are to mention noteworthy neighbours, however, we could not forget <span style="color:#FF0040">Trinity is also just a stone’s throw from the Grand Lodge</span>. No matter what may be said about any links between the Freemasons and the goings on within the Dáil or Westminster, the links between The Freemasons and Trinity are undoubtedly significant and historic. There are two Irish Lodges connected with College: University Lodge No 33 which was established in 1871, and Trinity College Lodge No 357 established shortly afterwards in 1874, apparently due to large numbers in the first. The two Lodges have “a long history of interconnectedness,” says  Eoin Pluincéid, the Worshipful Master of the Trinity College Lodge. They do not hold their meetings on campus, but hold them in the Grand Lodge like all but one of the other 30 odd Dublin based Lodges, the exception being the Dalkey Lodge. <br>
<br>
..The Trinity College Dublin Lodge London is another Lodge which was initially set up in 1906 for “alumni of Trinity College Dublin who lived or worked in London”...</div></blockquote>

I reckon we need to take a closer look at the Irish doctor Michael Ryan at the WHO: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Ryan_%28doctor%29" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Ryan_(doctor)</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Michael Joseph Ryan[1] (born 1965) is an Irish epidemiologist and former trauma surgeon, specialising in infectious disease and public health. He is executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, leading the team responsible for the international containment and treatment of COVID-19...<br>
<br>
Ryan is from the townland of Curry, near Tubbercurry, in County Sligo, Ireland.[6] He grew up in the town of Charlestown in County Mayo.[4] His father worked as a merchant sailor.[1]<br>
<br>
Ryan trained in medicine at the National University of Ireland in Galway.[1] He received training in orthopaedics in Scotland.[1] Ryan has a<span style="color:#FF0040"> Masters of Public Health from University College Dublin</span>. He later completed specialist training in communicable disease control, public health and infectious disease at the Health Protection Agency in London. Ryan also completed the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET)..<br>
