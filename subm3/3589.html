<blockquote class="uncited"><div>NEW YORK (AP) — After months of holding on to power amid sexual harassment allegations and defying calls to resign, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo abruptly did just that Tuesday. With Cuomo on his way out, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul is ascendant.<br>
<br>
We take you through the major players, what’s happened this week and what’s next for Cuomo, Hochul and the state of New York:<br>
<br>
REMIND ME — WHAT WAS CUOMO ACCUSED OF?<br>
<br>
Cuomo was under investigation for several things, but the prevailing issue leading to his resignation concerned sexual harassment allegations that ranged from inappropriate comments to groping. An investigative report released last week said he sexually harassed 11 women, many of whom had worked for him or the state. Other issues in play in a state Assembly impeachment probe: how his administration handled data on COVID-19-related deaths in nursing homes, his $5 million pandemic leadership book deal and whether friends and relatives were given special access to COVID-19 tests early in the pandemic.</div></blockquote>

Let's remember that Andrew Cuomo is in Jeffrey Epstein black book:<br>

Ghislaine Maxwell was invited to Andrew Cuomo wedding, according to this article from year 1992, found through searchvoat:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I did not recognize in Ghislaine Maxwell the young woman her friends had described to me—the racy, glamorous social flibbertigibbet whom George Hamilton had escorted to the Ever Ready Derby in England and skied with in Aspen, <strong class="text-strong">who had attended the Kerry Kennedy-Andrew Cuomo wedding</strong>, and who had once instructed her father's pilot to put his helicopter into a free-fall to scare her fellow passenger.</div></blockquote>

Brother of Andrew Cuomo is Chris Cuomo, a CNN journalist:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cuomo" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cuomo</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Christopher Charles Cuomo (/ˈkwoʊmoʊ/ KWOH-moh; born August 9, 1970)[1][2] is an American television journalist, best known as the presenter of Cuomo Prime Time, a weeknight news analysis show on CNN.[3][4] <strong class="text-strong">Cuomo is the brother of outgoing New York Governor Andrew Cuomo</strong> and son of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo.<br>
<br>
Cuomo has previously been the ABC News chief law and justice correspondent and the co-anchor for ABC's 20/20,[3][4] and before his current show, he was one of two co-anchors of the weekday edition of New Day, a three-hour morning news show, until May 2018.[5]</div></blockquote>

Wife of Chris Cuomo was found in 1997 Jeffrey Epstein black book, this is relatively "new" news:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cristina-greeven-chris-coumo-epstein-1997-address-book-2021-7?IR=T" class="postlink">https://www.businessinsider.com/cristin ... 021-7?IR=T</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong">Cristina Greeven Cuomo, who is married to Chris Cuomo, is in Jeffrey Epstein's 1997 address book</strong></span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">* Last week, Insider published an address book from 1997 that belonged to Jeffrey Epstein.<br>
<br>
* The book has entries for 349 people and predates Epstein's other "little black book" by seven years.<br>
<br>
* One entry is for Cristina Greeven Cuomo, the editor in chief of The Purist and wife of Chris Cuomo.</strong><br>
<br>
Jeffrey Epstein's newly discovered 1997 address book, published by Insider on Tuesday, connects dozens of new names to Epstein and traces previously known relationships back to the 1990s. One of the new names belongs to Cristina Greeven Cuomo, a New York editor and entrepreneur. She married Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor and brother of Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, in 2001.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://i.insider.com/60ec793661b8600019f16a2f?width=1600&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp" class="postlink">https://i.insider.com/60ec793661b860001 ... &amp;auto=webp</a><br>
<strong class="text-strong">Greeven Cuomo's entry (misspelled as "Christina") in Epstein's address book from 1997.</strong><br>
<br>
The book lists Greeven Cuomo under a minor misspelling of her birth name, Cristina Greeven. Her entry refers to Manhattan File, a New York society magazine she published after her father purchased it in 1994. The same entry includes an office address in the New York City neighborhood of SoHo, an office phone number, and a home phone number. <strong class="text-strong">In the '90s, Greeven Cuomo was known for hanging out with socialites like Alex von Furstenberg</strong> and the former CNN producer Pamela Gross. The latter appears in both "little black books" and is now a close friend of Melania Trump.<br>
<br>
It's unclear why Greeven Cuomo is listed in the 1997 address book. She serves as the editor in chief of The Purist, a wellness website she founded in 2017. A message left with The Purist seeking comment from Greeven Cuomo was returned almost immediately by Chris Cuomo, who declined to comment for the record or make his spouse available.<br>
<br>
Greeven Cuomo is one of 221 people who appear in Epstein's 1997 address book but not his previously published address book, which dates to 2004.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Connection to circle of Furstenbergs is interesting because they are tied to Epstein/Maxwell circle and potentially even to original Pizzagate circle of James Alefantis, how? Let me send you through another rabbit hole with friend of James Alefantis and Tony Podesta - Michael Louis Giacalone who is very likely somehow connected to Italian Princess Virginia von Furstenberg, the post about it is here:<br>
