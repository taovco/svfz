<br>
<br>
The world’s richest medical research foundation, the Wellcome Trust, has teamed up with a pair of former DARPA ( evil) directors who built Silicon Valley’s skunkworks to usher in an age of  surveillance, including for babies as young as three months old. Their agenda can only advance if we allow it.<br>
<br>
A UK nonprofit (founder, Sir Henry Wellcome, was a pharmaceutical entrepreneur)  with ties to global corruption <br>
and ties to the eugenics movement launched a global health-focused DARPA equivalent last year. The move went largely unnoticed by both mainstream and independent media as if it would even be on the news. <br>
<br>
The Wellcome Trust, launched its own global equivalent of the Pentagon’s secretive research agency last year, officially to combat the “most pressing health challenges of our time.” Though first conceived of in 2018, this particular Wellcome Trust initiative was spun off from the Trust last May with $300 million in initial funding. It quickly attracted two former DARPA executives, who had previously served in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley, to manage and plan its portfolio of projects. <br>
<br>
This global health DARPA, known as Wellcome Leap, seeks to achieve “breakthrough scientific and technological solutions” by or before 2030, with a focus on “complex global health challenges.” The Wellcome Trust is open about how Wellcome Leap will apply the approaches of Silicon Valley and venture capital firms to the health and life science sector. Unsurprisingly, their three current programs are poised to develop incredibly invasive tech-focused, and in some cases overtly transhumanist, medical technologies, including a program exclusively focused on using artificial intelligence (AI), mobile sensors, and wearable brain-mapping tech for children three years old and younger. Sounds like Elon Musks program <br>
<br>
This Unlimited Hangout investigation explores not only the four current programs of Wellcome Leap but also the people behind it. The resulting picture is of an incredibly sinister project that poses not only a great threat to current society but to the future of humanity itself. An upcoming Unlimited Hangout investigation will examine the history of the Wellcome Trust along with its role in recent and current events.<br>
<br>
<br>
Disgusting. Another org fighting against us.  Another org. to keep an eye on. <br>
Their board has ties to Aus., Zuckerberg and China, Prince of Wales etc <br>

			<div class="content">Catholic priest at Davos on AI and the soul - The Tablet   <a href="https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/12405/catholic-priest-at-davos-on-ai-and-the-soul" class="postlink">https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/12405/ ... d-the-soul</a>  <br>
Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum.  <br>
<br>
New technologies in society raise important questions about the soul, according to a Catholic delegate attending the World Economic Forum in Davos.   <br>
Fr Philip Larrey, Chair of Logic and Epistemology at the Pontifical Lateran University, who has been in discussions with tech companies about the ethical questions around Artificial Intelligence and robots, took part in a discussion “Faith in the Fourth Industrial Revolution", sponsored by the United Arab Emirates.   <br>
<br>
Fr Larrey told The Tablet that how emerging technologies raise questions about immortality and the soul. Among Silicon Valley billionaires, he explained, heavy investment was going into technologies about how to vastly extend life expectancy and the “transhumanist” movement looking at ways to transfer human consciousness into a digital format.   <br>
“The smartest ones [tech companies] want to dialogue with the Catholic Church because we have a 2,000 year tradition about what it means to be human,” he said. “The richness of the Catholic tradition gives us the framework to speak out the technologies we have. How we were created and what is our purpose.”     <br>
Fr Larrey, from Mountain View, California, where Google has its HQ, and who helped arrange the 2016 meeting between the Pope and Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google holding company Alphabet, pointed out that “the question of whether we can we really become immortal goes back to the Book of Genesis.”     <br>
<br>
He said some of the tech gurus have made it clear they are not interested in having a dialogue with the Vatican.      <br>
“They want to do their own thing, and are pushing ahead with a lot of money with projects to try and keep them immortal, or solve health issues,” said Fr Larrey, who has written two books, Connected World and Artificial Humanity.      <br>
Last September, Silicon Valley big hitters went to the Vatican to discuss ethics amid talk of a potential papal document on artificial intelligence. Archbishop Vincenzio Paglia, the Pope’s point man on family and pro-life issues, has met Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft. The next assembly of his Pontifical Academy of Life department will focus on AI.     <br>
Fr Larrey stressed that whatever the technological developments, it was important to put people before platforms  “The Church is not against the use of machines, but what the Pope is saying is put the human being at the centre of technology,” he explained .     <br>
The priest-philosopher pointed out that parishes, while using digital technology, are places of human contact. He said claims about robots taking over the world are overblown, and that governments will not allow machines to take over peoples’ jobs right away. The same is true for pastoral ministry.   <br>
“I don’t see robot priests in the future,” he added.   <br>
<br>
Fr Larrey is also Chairman of Humanity 2.0 which provides a dialogue platform between the public, private and faith sectors. He has been to Davos before and while he enjoys the opportunities to meet people, is not uncritical. “It’s freezing cold, and everyone you meet is a VIP who thinks they have been endowed with a right to rule the world,” he joked.   <br>
Pope Francis in his message reminded those at the gathering for the World Economic Forum that their overriding concern must be for “the one human family,” and warned against the “isolationism, individualism and ideological colonisation” of contemporary debate.   <br>
<br>
Digital and technological changes, he said, had benefited humanity, but also left people behind. The Pope’s message was delivered by Cardinal Peter Turkson, of the integral human development dicastery, who was in Davos, and who was joined by Fr Augusto Zampini-Davies, an official at the dicastery.</div>
