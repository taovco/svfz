<br>
So, I've recently seen videos about Elon Musk's Neuro Lace (for the brain) project and did a search for that..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Graphene-based neural probe detects brain activity at high resolution and signal quality<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">KurzweilAINetwork</span><br>
733 Turnpike St, North Andover, MA 01845, USA <a href="https://trends.medicalexpo.com/project-419752.html" class="postlink">https://trends.medicalexpo.com/project-419752.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Researchers from the <span style="color:#FF0040">European Graphene Flagship*</span> have developed a new microelectrode array neural probe based on graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) for recording brain activity at high resolution while maintaining excellent signal-to-noise ratio (quality).<br>
<br>
The new neural probe could lay the foundation for a future generation of in vivo neural recording implants, for patients with epilepsy, for example, and for disorders that affect brain function and motor control, the researchers suggest. It could possibly play a role in Elon Musk’s just-announced Neuralink “neural lace” research project....<br>
<br>
In an experiment with rats, the researchers used the new devices to record brain activity during sleep and in response to visual light stimulation.<br>
<br>
The graphene transistor probes showed good spatial discrimination (identifying specific locations) of the brain activity and outperformed state-of-the-art platinum electrode arrays, with higher signal amplification and a better signal-to-noise performance when scaled down to very small sizes.<br>
<br>
That means the graphene transistor probes can be more densely packed and at higher resolution, features that are vital for precision mapping of brain activity. And since the probes have transistor amplifiers built in, they remove the need for the separate pre-amplification required with metal electrodes.<br>
<br>
Neural probes are placed directly on the surface of the brain, so safety is important. The researchers determined that the flexible graphene-based probes are non-toxic, did not induce any significant inflammation, and are long-lasting....<br>
<br>
“Once we have demonstrated the proof of concept in animal studies, the next goal will be to work towards the first human clinical trial with graphene devices during intraoperative mapping of the brain. This means addressing all regulatory issues associated to medical devices such as safety, biocompatibility, etc.”...<br>
<br>
* With a budget of €1 billion, the Graphene Flagship consortium consists of more than 150 academic and industrial research groups in 23 countries. <span style="color:#FF0040">Launched in 2013, the goal is to take graphene from the realm of academic laboratories into European society within 10 years</span>. The research was a collaborative effort involving Flagship partners Technical University of Munich (TU Munich. Germany), Institut d’Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS, Spain), Spanish National Research Council (CSIC, Spain), The Biomedical Research Networking Center in Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN, Spain) and the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2, Spain)...

An integrated brain-machine interface platform with thousands of channels<br>
Elon Musk, Neuralink <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703801v2" class="postlink">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703801v2</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Abstract<br>
Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold promise for the restoration of sensory and motor function and the treatment of neurological disorders, but clinical BMIs have not yet been widely adopted, in part because modest channel counts have limited their potential. In this white paper, we describe Neuralink’s first steps toward a scalable high-bandwidth BMI system.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Graphene Flagship is a European Union’ scientific research initiative.[1][citation needed] With a budget of €1 billion, it represents a new form of joint, coordinated research initiative on an unprecedented scale.[2] Through a combined academic-industrial consortium,[3] the research effort covers the entire value chain, from materials production to components and system integration, and targets a number of specific goals that exploit the unique properties of graphene.[4] There are some critics of this and similar initiatives, arguing that excessive funding of graphene-related research and innovation is disproportional to estimates of <span style="color:#FF0040">industrial potential</span>.<br>
<br>
History<br>
In 2009, the European Commission identified the need for Europe to address the big scientific and technological challenges of the age through long-term, multidisciplinary R&amp;D efforts. One of the first European Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) Flagships, the Graphene Flagship was founded in October 2013. The Graphene Flagship was initially implemented as a Seventh Framework Programme under the auspices of the European Commission's Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect). Now the consortium will fall under FP7's successor research and innovation framework, <span style="color:#FF0040">Horizon 2020</span>. The second FET Flagship, <span style="color:#FF0040">The Human Brain Project</span>, is charged with revolutionizing the future of neuroscience. In May 2016 the EC has announced the third FET Flagship, <span style="color:#FF0040">Quantum Technologies Flagship</span>, which will become a key part of the data and computing Infrastructure which underpins the <span style="color:#FF0040">European Cloud Initiative</span>, as part of the Commission's strategy to digitize European industry..<br>
<br>
Organisation<br>
The Graphene Flagship is coordinated by Chalmers University of Technology based in Gothenburg, Sweden. Director of the Graphene Flagship is Professor Jari Kinaret, leader of the Condensed Matter Theory group at Chalmers’ Department of Applied Physics.[8] Vice-Director of the Graphene Flagship is Professor Patrik Johansson,[9] research professor at Chalmers University of Technology.[10] The operative management is handled by the Director and a Management Panel which is chaired by the Science and Technology Officer, Prof. Andrea C. Ferrari[8] from the University of Cambridge, and includes the Flagship Director, the Head of Innovation and the five Division Heads. Strategic decisions are taken by the Executive Board which includes the members of the management panel and ten members elected by the General Assembly of all 150 partners.<br>
<br>
The Strategic Advisory Council (SAC) consists of world-renowned scientific and industrial experts, including four Nobel laureates. Its key tasks are to advise on strategic research decisions and issues pertaining to handling and protection of intellectual property whilst also facilitating contacts to related national and international research programs and acting as ambassadors for the Graphene Flagship. The Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Council is Professor Sir Andre Geim, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. The Graphene Flagship is divided into 20 work packages, 15 focusing on specific science and technology topics, and five dedicated to innovation and operational/management functions.[11] The work packages are grouped into six divisions to enhance collaboration and communication. One of the Divisions is housing the partnering projects.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Soothing the symptoms of anxiety with graphene oxide. Graphene oxide inhibits post-traumatic stress disorder.<br>
<br>
Researchers from Graphene Flagship partners SISSA in Italy, ICN2 in Spain and the University of Manchester in the UK, in collaboration with the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the University of São Paulo, have discovered that graphene oxide inhibits anxiety-related behaviours in a model study. They found that injecting graphene oxide into a specific region of the brain silences the neurons responsible for anxious behaviour.

<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">Burzum</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burzum" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burzum</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Burzum (/ˈbɜːrzəm/; Norwegian: [ˈbʉ̀rtsʉm]) was a Norwegian music project founded by Varg Vikernes in 1991. Although Burzum never played live performances, it became a part of the early Norwegian black metal scene and is considered one of the most influential acts in black metal's history.[4][5][6][7] He has also released four dark ambient and neofolk albums. The word "burzum" means "darkness" in the black speech, a fictional language crafted by Lord of the Rings writer J. R. R. Tolkien..<br>
<br>
Vikernes founded Burzum in 1991 and recorded the first four Burzum albums between January 1992 and March 1993.<span style="color:#FF0040"> From 1994 to 2009, Vikernes was imprisoned for the murder of Mayhem guitarist Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth and the arson of three churches.</span> While imprisoned, he recorded two dark ambient albums using only synthesizers, as he had no access to drums, guitar, or bass. Since his release from prison in 2009, he has recorded several more albums. Vikernes announced the end of Burzum in 2018, but released the project's final album Thulêan Mysteries in 2020.</div></blockquote>

Varg Vikernes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varg_Vikernes" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varg_Vikernes</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Described as "the most notorious metal musician of all time",[11] Vikernes remains controversial for his crimes as well as his political and religious views. He promoted views which combined Odinism and Esoteric Nazism, and openly embraced Nazism during the mid-late 1990s. He has since disavowed the ideology and its associated movements, although commentators continue to label his views as far-right. Vikernes calls his beliefs "Odalism" and advocates a "pre-industrial European pagan society", opposing Christianity, Islam, Judaism, capitalism, socialism and materialism...<br>
<br>
Arson of churches<br>
<br>
On 6 June 1992, the Fantoft Stave Church, dating from the 12th century and considered architecturally significant, was burned to the ground by arson. The cover of Burzum's EP Aske ("ashes") is a photograph of the destroyed church.[30] By January 1993, arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major stave churches, including one on Christmas Eve of 1992.[7] Vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases: the arson and attempted arson of Åsane Church and Storetveit Church in Bergen, the arson of Skjold Church in Vindafjord, and the arson of Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo. He was also charged with the arson of Fantoft Stave Church, although the jurors found him not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case.[31]<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">At the time, media outlets reported that Vikernes was associated with theistic Satanism</span>.[32] In later interviews Vikernes, while not accepting responsibility for the arsons, said that they were not Satanic, but instead "revenge" for the Christian desecration of Viking graves and temples. According to Vikernes, the arsons were on the anniversary of the Lindisfarne Viking raid.[33][34] Vikernes claimed that all the burnings, except for the one at Stavanger, were done by one person..<br>
<br>
In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, Bergens Tidende, brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.. According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal, and get more customers for <span style="color:#FF0000">Helvete</span>..</div></blockquote>

Helvete, ideology and the "Black Circle" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Norwegian_black_metal_scene#Helvete,_ideology_and_the_%22Black_Circle%22" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Nor ... _Circle%22</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mayhem guitarist Euronymous was "the central figure involved in the formation of the Norwegian black metal scene",[25] which he "almost single-handedly founded".[26] During May–June 1991,[27] he opened a record shop called Helvete[28] (Norwegian for "Hell").[29] The shop was at Schweigaards gate 56 in Oslo. Norwegian black metal musicians often met at the shop and in its basement. They included the members of Mayhem, the members of Emperor, Varg "Count Grishnackh" Vikernes of Burzum, and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch of Thorns. Euronymous also founded an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. ...<br>
<br>
Those who gathered at Helvete have been referred to as the "Black Circle" or "Black Metal Inner Circle", a name allegedly invented by Euronymous.[6] Euronymous presented the "Black Circle" as an organized, cult-like group of militant Satanists whose activities were funded by his record shop, and a 1993 Kerrang! article referred to them as "Satanic terrorists".[34] Faust later said that it was "just a name that was invented for the people who hung around the shop ... there wasn't anything like members and membership cards and official meetings".[35] Likewise, in his review of Lucifer Rising, Varg Vikernes said, "The so-called 'Black Circle' was something Euronymous made up because he wanted to make people believe there was such a thing, but it was nonsense and never existed. The media on the other hand believed it existed for a while, but quickly stopped talking about it when they understood it was a fake rumor".[...<br>
<br>
The Norwegian black metal scene was bitterly opposed to Christianity and organized religion as a whole. In interviews during the early 1990s, Euronymous and other members of the scene presented themselves as militant misanthropic Devil worshippers[40] who wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. They attacked the Church of Satan for being too "humane".[41] The theistic Satanism they espoused was an inversion of Christianity.[42] Euronymous was the key figure behind this ideology.[32][25] He professed to be in favor of totalitarianism and against compassion, peace, happiness and fun.[43] When asked why such statements were made to the press, Ihsahn of Emperor said, "I think that was very much to create fear among people".[44] He added that the scene "wanted to be in opposition to society" and "tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy".[45] Vikernes said that the reason they claimed to advocate "evil" was to provoke...</div></blockquote>

PARISIANS LOVE THEIR MEAT. Starting with the sliders and champagne served during last Sunday’s lunchtime preview of “Sterling Ruby: Paris,” in the Gagosian Gallery hangar at Le Bourget, some form of animal fat was on the menu at every meal related to the forty-second edition of FIAC (Foire Internationale d’Art Contemporain)...<br>
<br>
The French love fashion as much as they do art. At Le Bourget, where high-net-worth clients can pull up their private jets to Gagosian’s back door, the Ruby opening was only one sign of how seamlessly the two worlds mesh in Paris. ..<br>
<br>
Raf Simons has incorporated paintings by Ruby in fabrics for his eponymous menswear line, examples of which both artist and designer were wearing at the opening. “We’ll do it again,” said Ruby, clad head-to-toe in bleached Simons/Ruby denim. Huge Ruby tapestries hung on the walls. Instead of his signature sculptural ooze, big and black abstract hulks reminiscent of Matthew Barney’s smashed cars sat on the polished concrete floor. These were actually cut up and rearranged parts of a 1972 submarine that Ruby discovered going to rust in Long Beach, California. As art, it’s just as lethal...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Excerpts:<br>
<br>
..According to Gilad Atzmon, Weinstein’s actions should be seen as an extension of the antinomianism of the Sabbateans. In support of his assertion, Atzmon references a source who told Page Six that Weinstein has been telling confidantes “that he was born to take the fall for his behavior in order to ‘change the world.’ He is resigned to his punishment—as a martyr for social change.”[3] According to Atzmon, “Weinstein’s regard for himself as a ‘martyr for social change’ is consistent with Tikun Olam—the misguided Jewish belief that it is down to the Jews to repair the world.”

..When the Baker Street robbery of the safe deposit boxes at London branch of Lloyds Bank took place on the night of September 11, 1971, despite wide interest in the crime, details about the loot and the criminals responsible were immediately suppressed by MI5 and senior government officials. Speculation quickly arose that compromising sexual photographs of Princess Margaret, had been uncovered in the bank vault. It was rumoured they had been stashed away by Michael X, the Black Power leader who was connected to the Profumo Affair.Michael X associated with the radical arts scene in Notting Hill, which comprised the leading personalities of the LSD scene of Swinging London, including Alexander Trocchi, Bob Guccione (founder of Penthouse Magazine), Timothy Leary, Tavistock psychiatrist and Esalen personality R.D. Laing, Eric Clapton and William S. Burroughs, Stephen Abrams the founder of SOMA and celebrity photographer John “Hoppy” Hopkins.[48] In February 1971, Michael X fled back to Trinidad where he started an agricultural commune devoted to Black empowerment. But in 1972, he was convicted of murder for burying alive commune member Gale Ann Benson, a British model, socialite and daughter of Conservative MP Leonard Plugge. She had met Michael X through her relationship with Malcolm X’s cousin Hakim Jamal. Michael X was executed by hanging in 1975.<br>
<br>
..Prince Andrew and his then girlfriend Koo Stark would vacation there, as do now Prince William and Kate Middleton. Island visitors have included Hugh Grant, Elizabeth Hurley, Jemima Khan, and Liam Gallagher, Posh Spice, Amy Winehouse, Kate Moss, Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman, Quincy Jones, Richard Gere, Tom Hanks, Courtney Love, Lou Reed and Oasis’ Noel and Liam Gallagher, Denzel Washington.[52] Several high net-worth individuals have acquired land in Mustique, including Roman Abromovich’s ex-wife and <span style="color:#FF0040">Ivanka’s friend Dasha Zhukova</span>; Dylan Jones, editor of the UK version of men’s fashion and lifestyle magazine GQ; Israeli comedian and satirist Nimrod Kamer; and Academy Award nominated filmmaker Julian Schnabel.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2002:<br>
<br>
This morning, in a former brothel at 233 Fifth Avenue in New York City, a Museum of Sex opens its doors for the first time. Who wants a museum of sex in a reputedly wicked city where a lot of real sex is supposedly available? We know who doesn't want it. Well before the opening, William Donohue, the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, issued a statement calling its scholarly advisers "pornographers" and suggesting that it should contain "a death chamber that would acknowledge all the wretched diseases that promiscuity has caused"...<br>
<br>
..This last claim on behalf of New York seems designed to encourage the city's idea of itself as pre-eminent over all other cities in all fields, especially in wickedness. Where else could the museum have been sited, asks Daniel Gluck, its executive director, but in New York, "a city bold enough, big enough, bad enough, bizarre enough and brazen enough to have a sexual history unlike that of any other"?<br>
<br>
Really? I hate to say it, but I think the picture of New York as a big, bad, brazen city is a bit of a myth. Of course, New York has a bawdy past. What great city hasn't? The museum shows how there were already gay resorts in the Bowery in the late 19th century. It explains how the murder in 1836 of Helen Jewett, a 23-year-old prostitute, exposed the city's commercial sex industry. It tells how Julius Schmid, a German immigrant, turned sausage casings into condoms in 1883...<br>
<br>
..New York, alas, is not especially wicked. I suspect London of being more so. Certainly, London has much more crime, if you exclude murders. Certainly, New Yorkers are much more polite. I was told by a friend in New York last week that he hadn't even witnessed so much as a scuffle, let alone a mugging, during the past year. Perhaps September 11 has made New Yorkers more public-spirited than they used to be, but the city has always exuded courtesy...</div></blockquote>

Location One Suspends Operation <a href="http://www.location1.org/farewell/" class="postlink">http://www.location1.org/farewell/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It is time to close Location One. We have had 15 glorious years, and we are extremely proud that we were able to offer this oasis to artists in which to dream and experiment. Our own lives and those of the community were enriched by all the thoughtful questioning and collaboration of so many artists and thinkers. The world in which we find ourselves has changed radically from those early days when the internet was new and computers a mystery and residencies were a rare gift, but the creativity that gave birth to so many extraordinary events and exhibitions will live on in the lives of the wonderful artists and thinkers with whom we were privileged to work.<br>
<br>
We have closed our international residency program. We will suspend our exhibition, performance and discussion programs as of June 30, 2013. Heather Wagner and Kristofer Widholm have created a beautiful archive, “The Annals of Location One” to honor the artists and thinkers who graced our galleries: location1.org. Please have a look! We will maintain this for as long as possible....<br>

ICN2 group leader ICREA Prof. Jose Antonio Garrido and fellow Graphene Flagship programme coordinator, Prof. Kostas Kostarelos of the University of Manchester, were invited by Advanced Materials to present their vision of the role of graphene in the design of advanced brain-computer interfaces. Published earlier this month, the work entitled “Graphene in the design and engineering of next-generation neural interfaces” outlines the current state-of-the-art in this field, along with the ways graphene is allowing us to overcome some of the obstacles to fully realising the next generation of neural interfaces. ..<br>
<br>
..Having recently embarked on a biomedical research programme within the European Commission’s Graphene Flagship project, Prof. Kostas Kostarelos of the University of Manchester and ICREA Prof. Jose Antonio Garrido, leader of the ICN2 Advanced Electronic Materials and Devices Group are well-qualified to bring us up to speed with the current state-of-the-art in neural interfaces. Looking through the lens of graphene as a key enabling material taking these technologies to the next level, they present the different challenges and applications currently being addressed in this field. Together with co-authors Dr. Clement Hebert (ICN2) and Dr. Melissa Vincent (Uni. Manchester), the review was invited for publication in Advanced Materials.<br>
<br>
..Graphene is known to be biocompatible with neural cells and its capacity to effectively interface with neuronal tissue allows for both recording and electrical stimulation functionalities at the desired levels. In fact, where current neural interfaces are designed to perform a single function, either recording or electrically stimulating brain tissue, graphene-based alternatives can combine both functions in a single device, even adding a few more into the mix.</div></blockquote>

Do Vaccines Deliver Graphene Oxide Nanoparticles for 5G Mind Control? <a href="https://int.artloft.co/do-vaccines-deliver-graphene-oxide-nanoparticles-for-5g-mind-control/" class="postlink">https://int.artloft.co/do-vaccines-deli ... d-control/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Spanish researchers say that graphene oxide nanoparticles found in covid vaccines are compatible with neurons and other brain cells. Nanotubes of grapheneoxide search and become attached to synapses. ..<br>
<br>
Building on last week’s findings, two Spanish researchers believe that the “secret nanoparticles” found in covid vaccines are nanotubes of graphene oxide. The Andalusian biostatistician Ricardo Delgado who hosts an online program called La Quinta Columna. (the fifth row) and his partner Dr. Jose Luis Sevillano (a family doctor) analyzed the undeniable magnetic phenomenon present in most vaccinated people. They found that graphene oxide nano particles are actually compatible with neurons and other brain cells. Nanotubes of grapheneoxide search the synapses and attach to them.<br>
<br>
Graphene nanoparticles were excitable through frequencies-generating behavioral changes in the subjects. To be more exact: graphene nanoparticles find resonance in the frequency of 41,6 GHz microwaves of the 5G technology.<br>
<br>
Subjects inoculated with graphene oxide nanoparticles can be manipulated mentally by tuning into different frequencies inside the 5G ranges. They can feel, think and see feelings, thoughts or things that don’t actually exist. They could develop fake memories or delete real existing memories. Even without a fully-enabled 5G net, people have reported they feel strange after taking the jab. Other studies say graphene nanoparticles are responsible for covid associated symptoms and blood clots....</div></blockquote></div>
