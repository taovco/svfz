Ex host Chris Hansen Turns Himself In Over Sex Trafficking Video Issue<br>
<br>
<br>
The 61-Year-Old TV Personality Reportedly Is Briefly Detained In Corunna, Michigan After He Failed To Show Up At A Court Hearing In Relation Of Him Not Handing Over Of A Video Evidence.<br>
<br>
<br>
Former host of "To Catch a Predator", Chris Hansen, was arrested on July 2. The TV personality turned himself into authorities after a warrant was out for his arrest as he skipped a court date in Michigan.<br>
<br>
Hansen was subpoenaed to be in court Thursday in Shiawassee County in connection to a sting operation he assisted authorities with.<br>
<br>
<br>
He was required to explain why he didn't present video evidence for a sex-trafficking case.  It was said that the video will be used against three men charged with attempting to solicit underage girls for sex.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After being briefly arrested, Hansen was eventually released and has 14 days to deliver the uncut video. He took to his Instagram account to explain his current situation, writing, "The court matter in Shiawasse Co, Mi today resulted from a predator investigation there. Defense lawyers for accused predator Michael Lott had requested video from the investigation. There was miscommunication about a hearing today on the issue. The matter is currently being resolved!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
His lawyer claimed that his client didn't appear at the court hearing because of a misunderstanding concerning a subpoena. "He wasn't intending to not appear or to be somebody that was trying to circumvent the process. It was just an unfortunate set of circumstances that resulted in a failure to appear," attorney Clint Perryman told AP.<br>
<br>
Prior to this, reporter claimed that he interviewed one of the suspects arrested, a 32-year-old corrections officer. "While I think nothing will ever shock me, here again is somebody who is a lawman, who is sworn to protect, whose job it is to monitor inmates in a state prison," Hansen said. "It goes to show that these guys come from all walks of life."<br>
<br>
<br>
I just don’t except this “miscommunication “ bit. Read on <br>

To Catch a Predator" host Chris Hansen was arrested after he allegedly wrote bad checks to a vendor he owed money to, according to police.<br>
<br>
Hansen turned himself in to the Stamford Police Department in Connecticut after a warrant was issued on a felony charge of issuing a bad check, Stamford Sgt. Sean Scanlan said.<br>
<br>
Chris Hansen, former host of the television program "To Catch a Predator," was arrested Monday in his hometown of Stamford, on charges he wrote bad checks for $13,000 worth of marketing materials.Stamford Police Department / via AP<br>
In summer 2017, Hansen bought about $13,000 worth of promotional items, like hats, shirts and mugs from a local company, and paid for them with a check that bounced.<br>
<br>
"The owner and Hansen go back and forth for a period of time," and in April of 2018, Hansen gave the business owner another check, Scanlan said. That one bounced, too.<br>
<br>
Police issued a warrant for Hansen's arrest after he refused to speak with them, Scanlan said.<br>
<br>
Hansen hosted NBC's "Dateline" series "To Catch a Predator" until it was canceled in 2008. He also hosted spinoffs "To Catch an I.D. Thief" and "To Catch a Con Man."<br>
<br>
In 2015, Hansen launched a kickstarter to fund a new show, "Hansen vs. Predator." Mugs and T-shirts are listed as incentives for donating.<br>
<br>
Hansen has been released without bond and a written promise to appear in court. It's not clear if Hansen has an attorney, and a phone number listed for him in Connecticut has been disconnected.</div>
