In protest of the Gov's pizza party mishap, upwards of about 20 democrats attended the "State of the State" in NM wearing pizza socks. However, what caught my eye was the blatant boy lover symbol on the socks. <a href="http://archive.is/NCI3k" class="postlink">http://archive.is/NCI3k</a><br>

This article talks about how Senate Majority Leader Michael Sanchez had been confronted by the media to see if he would show his pizza socks, but according to the article "He first refused to acknowledge the question, but then changed his mind." <a href="https://archive.is/G7di9" class="postlink">https://archive.is/G7di9</a> Why the hesitation Senator Sanchez?

Behind the Gates of Silo Ridge—the Country’s Most Exclusive New Residential Enclave <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/silo-ridge-field-club" class="postlink">https://www.architecturaldigest.com/sto ... field-club</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Most members of the Silo Ridge Field Club community come by car. Some have drivers. A few chopper in. I arrived on a bus.<br>

There is a train to the private club and gated community—the latest addition to liquor tycoon and developer Mike Meldman’s <span style="color:#FF0040">19 Discovery Land properties</span>—which sits on 800 pristine acres smack in the midst of the Hudson Valley, near Amenia, New York..<br>
<br>
If you have not heard of Discovery Land, here’s the deal: Centered on members-only golf clubs, they are also turnkey real-estate developments. (One must be a homeowner to join the club.) They are golf-centric spots in Maui; Big Sky, Montana; the Hamptons; Austin; and the Bahamas; where affluent individuals can come with their families and be completely taken care of—like they would be at a five-star hotel—but also have their own home. Discovery’s clients are the kind of wealthy people who are turned on by having a vacation home near Tom Brady (the staff at Silo mentioned his membership multiple times)...<br>
<br>
On my train back to New York, I thought about why alcohol branding would feature so prominently in a zone that emphasized such seemingly disparate elements of nature and luxury. The things most people know about Casamigos is that George Clooney and Rande Gerber (the husband of Cindy Crawford) are the owners, and that it was sold last year for nearly a billion dollars. These are markers, not necessarily for Meldman, but certainly for the kind of clients Silo wants to attract.</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">EDIT:  I'm adding info relating to reported Pegasus related spying in the Khashoggi case.<br>
<br>
Seems like a crude timeline should be put together with some other info besides what is covered in the CDAN post.  No assumptions are being made by listing some people and events, but it may give food for thought on potential rabbit holes.  I'm in the middle of compiling the various links so I'll be editing in more.  <br>
BTW Bezos just stepped down as Amazon CEO on July 4th, 2021. <br>
*************************************<br>
 <br>
<br>
Bezos attended at least two dinners with Epstein, in 2004 and 2011 <a href="https://www.insider.com/epstein-riyadh-saudi-arabia-private-jet-2019-9" class="postlink">https://www.insider.com/epstein-riyadh- ... jet-2019-9</a><br>

Jan 28, 2016 Jeff Bezos delivered remarks during the opening ceremony of the media company's new location in Washington.<br>
<br>
Nov 7, 2016: (on the eve of the election) Jeffrey Epstein's private jet flew from Paris to somewhere over the Arabian Peninsula <a href="https://archive.is/Tlzyh" class="postlink">https://archive.is/Tlzyh</a><br>
Epstein's Gulfstream GV-SP landed in Riyadh at King Khalid International, the main airport of the Saudi Arabian capital.<br>
<br>
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with whom Epstein has claimed to be close friends, was in Riyadh at the same time, holding meetings with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.<br>
<br>
Epstein told a New York Times reporter that he personally knew and routinely played host to MBS.<br>

May 2017 President Trump visited Saudi Arabia<br>
 <br>
EDIT May 17, 2017 Bodyguards belonging to the Turkish president's security detail were involved in Tuesday's mass brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence here, senior U.S. officials confirmed to NBC News.  Embassy properties, he added, also aren't technically under the jurisdiction of the United States. It's unclear how much of the altercation outside of the Turkish ambassador's residence took place on embassy property.<br>
"Americans need to understand that these guys are used to dealing with radicals in their own countries and getting away with it," Giacalone said. "They don't play." ...President Donald Trump had met with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the White House just hours earlier.<br>
<br>
On June 9th 2017 Kacy Grine (advisor to Prince Al Waleed and several wealthy Europeans) attended a Rothschild sponsored fashion dinner that included 90 investors, Chelsea Clinton was also in attendence <a href="http://www.shangliutatler.com/fashion-beauty/fashion/wendy-yu-wearing-Mary-Katrantzou-20170614" class="postlink">http://www.shangliutatler.com/fashion-b ... u-20170614</a><br>
<br>
In July 2017, David J. Pecker visited long-time friend President Trump at the White House.  He brought along special guest Kacy Grine. (a French businessman who advises one of Saudi Arabia’s richest men, [namely Prince Al Waleed bin Talal] and sometimes acts as an intermediary between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Western businesses.  <a href="https://archive.is/PBTew#selection-2001.87-2001.145" class="postlink">https://archive.is/PBTew#selection-2001.87-2001.145</a>  Grine has been pictured traveling with Al Waleed [Grine was reportedly added to Pres.

<br>
Two months later, Sept 2017, Pecker was in Saudi Arabia, meeting with Mr. Grine and the crown prince about business opportunities there, according to A.M.I.<br>

**EDIT: Based on analysis of phones, it was found that Khashoggi’s wife, Hanan Elatr, an Egyptian flight attendant, was targeted with NSO’s spyware, Pegasus, before his murder. There were text messages containing malicious links that were disguised as coming from her sister. These were sent in November 2017 and again in 2018  <a href="https://thewire.in/world/pegasus-hacking-jamal-khashoggi-wife" class="postlink">https://thewire.in/world/pegasus-hackin ... hoggi-wife</a> (keep in mind  that "Amnesty’s technology lab were unable to conclusively determine whether the phone was successfully infected.."  The two were not romantically linked until March 2018.. curious.  "While they had met first in 2009, Elatr became romantically involved with Khashoggi only in March 2018 and got married in an Islamic ceremony four months later in northern Virginia, where Khashoggi was living in self-exile."<br>

 Considering the info in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/ari-emanuel-takes-on-the-world" class="postlink">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021 ... -the-world</a> regarding the middle east it seems there's a lot more to the story as it relates not only to the Bezos case but Epstein and sex trafficking for the elites.  One CDAN statement (don't have it handy) claims that due to the DOJ involvement in the same activities of procuring honey trap bait, no more high level arrests will be made in respect to the Epstein network.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Miss Venezuela beauty pageant, one of the most successful in the world, announced yesterday that it has closed down the casting for its contests to investigate a "break with the values and ethics of the event," after former beauty queens and employees were accussed of having ties to prostitution.<br>
<br>
During its 50-plus-year history, the Miss Venezuela Organization has produced seven Miss Universe and six Miss World title winner... However, if the prostitution claims are true, life as a beauty queen in this organization has a very dark side that goes well beyond excessive dieting. We are talking about corruption at the highest level. You won't believe the allegations.....<br>
<br>
Nuestra Belleza Latina's Osmel Sousa has been in the middle of it all...<br>
<br>
Trump owned the rights to Miss Universe until September 2015 when he sold them to the WME / IMG company. Only in this way did the participating countries, including Venezuela, agree to attend the event. ..<br>

I'm not discounting anyone, and the Miss Universe angle is intriguing (is it connected to Epstein?) <br>

Blind Items Revealed #1<br>
June 26, 2020<br>
<br>
Far from being stopped or shying away from illegal activity, this foreign born former A+ list model finder/agency head is taking advantage of his notoriety and is shipping tweens and early teens by the dozens from South America to the rest of the world for "modeling" assignments. The vast majority of these girls have not been heard from again.<br>

I have yet to find the actual reveal to the Blind reveal on the CDAN to confirm that it was Ari Emanuel, but the PG post showed it looked like a cut and paste. That reveal can't be confirmed.  No link provided, unfortunately.</div>

			<div class="content">Just have to say that I'm getting sick to my stomach, and as we know from years of contributing or reading PG research, such a feeling isn't unusual, as it happens all the time given the nature of the topic.  But what I'm getting is the kind of sick that comes from glimpsing the emerging overview of the components of what we've really been dealing with, how it's shaped our world and social culture and international relations. When seen  together, the predatory nature is revealed to be so all encompassing of our current global social and political culture, that it's to the point that it's nearly impossible to grasp the scope and scale of the infestation. But some stories and figures, taken in context together, suddenly stand out as aggregators and key in the all too often confusing or seemingly unrelated series of nexus points, and glimpses of the sheer scale of the festering hellscape begins to bleed through. Maybe the fact that it IS emerging is a good sign that what was hidden is being exposed. Still, it remains no end in sight.  I'll post some info later to try to convey what I mean, though if anyone does relate, you do.</div>

This is probably not what you mean but...<br>
<br>
The Black Ops Aviation logo<br>
<br>
<a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/57fa0a2f-aca2-4aec-a79e-c0fe7bccc7dc/logo/4bfffff3-8ee9-4d63-a767-2128b2c859a2.png/:/rs=h:160/qt=q:95" class="postlink">https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/57fa0a ... 60/qt=q:95</a><br>
<br>
looks like a reiteration of Open Society Foundations logo (not the font or style of letters clearly).<br>
<br>

<br>
As if you flew a helicopter over it like a landscape, and a piece lifted up (and reversed the black to white and white to black).</div>
