			<div class="content">So, I've been concerned about this network for some time.  Pedo elites, corrupt doctors and third world orphans makes for a worrying cocktail...<br>
<br>
Just to summarize the Nyumbani Orphanage posts so far:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pilot <span style="color:#FF0040">Simon Wood </span>was first arrested in 2000 for child sexual assault, before he and his mother had known involvement with politician Jeremy Hunt:.. Wood first came to the attention of police when he was accused of an indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl. He met the girl while volunteering for Diabetes UK,.. Wood was arrested over the sex attack, but – in an echo of the Jimmy Savile scandal – the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge him. He was allowed to keep his job at BA and, in an indictment of the vetting system, continued his charity work with children.<br>
<br>
Nyumbani appointed previously arrested for a child sexual offense BA pilot Simon Wood to its UK board of directors in 2003.<br>

<br>
I came across this:<br>
<br>
Pilot Simon Wood of Barnet, London, changes his flight instruments for a musical one as he entertains an HIV positive orphan during an Easter party at an orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya. Simon, who works as a Senior First Officer for British Airways, was one of 20 staff from the airline who hosted an Easter Day party for 79 young children at Nyumbani orphanage. The Nairobi based orphanage only cares for HIV positive orphans who have either lost their parents to AIDS or have been abandoned to look after themselves and fight the disease alone.
