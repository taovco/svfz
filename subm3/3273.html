			<div class="content">I knew Ruqqus was filled to the brim with bluepilled redditors, and they were sick of being censored. I knew they were ripe for redpilling. The ones that fought me the hardest turned out to be Jewish. I was implementing Hitler, Goebbels, George Lincoln Rockwell, and Yuri Bezmenov teachings. I studied it beyond what most would do, and decided to practice it to see if it worked. My findings: <br>
<br>
Holy shit they were right! Beyond what I ever could have imagined. With how far civilization has changed from the 1920's, literary <strong class="text-strong">nothing</strong> had changed as far as how this plays out. All the commies are the same, all the useful idiots act the same, and every fucking time you find the jew manipulating it all. <br>
<br>
My overall goal was to flip that site from claiming to be "free speech" to showing its hand as another controlled opposition website. Much to my utter shock and amazement, the admins are Jewish. So I figured I would return the favor of subversion right back at them. I used Yuri Bezmenov's model only instead of communist subversion, it was National Socialism. I "snow plowed them with propaganda" only instead of lies they were facts. I used Goebbels' philosophy on propaganda that "true propaganda doesn't need to lie". Here's a few snippets of my journey...<br>
<br>
They were mad at Rittenhaus being charged with Murder and all his "victims" were criminals. So I pounced. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/hijw7x.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Admin didn't appreciate my efforts, which I knew meant they weren't free speech. Puttitout, like him or hate him, only meddled once or twice in the community and paid dearly for it. He recanted, apologized, and promised to never let that happen again, (if you remember the builder/destroyer drama). <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/secjnw.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
That comment disappeared from the front page of the comments, unless you have the direct link, you can't find it. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusAdmin/post/2pws/jailbait-banned-for-sexualizing-minors/9frv" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusAdmin/post/2p ... inors/9frv</a><br>
<br>
Right there is where he revealed to me that he was full of shit. That motivated me further in my quest. I used the Jewish subversion method of goading your enemy into reacting the way you want. George Lincoln Rockwell taught it in his book White Power. They essentially poke the bear to get a reaction then play victim. So, he revealed to me that Nazis trigger him. That's mistake #1. <br>
<br>
Trolls never bothered him, he could just ban them. I saw it happen. So I didn't want to give him that opportunity to pass me off as just a troll trying to shit up the place, I wanted to present myself as peaceful and well meaning as any social justice warrior. I acted like the Jewish professors responsible for indoctrination, only in the opposite direction. In short, I was playing victim but actually had good evidence it was legit. The psychology of it is, the masses can be duped into fighting for the underdog, no matter how guilty that underdog. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/vuyek8.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
So I figured, why not see how far that tactic can go? I presented well meaning but very naughty-thought facts. I illustrated who was behind their every social grievance. I took a whooping in downvotes, (oy vey anuddah shoah!) and in the process illustrated they practiced the very persecution they claimed to be dead set against! This crashed the NPC programming. <br>

<br>
They were being deplatformed, and the host continued to bill them for it. Nothing reeked of jewery worse. Sure enough lol. They didn't appreciate badspeak about jews. This was the first major boat rocking I did. No one could debunk my facts, admin couldn't call them lies, and he couldn't ban me because I never even so much as used slurs. That time bomb was ticking though, and I continued my goading.<br>
<br>
Then I started to develop a following. This is really what triggered a response. My first ban came when I posted a pic of Gaddafi and JFK to illustrate what happens when you try to start your own bank. Ironically they were deplatformed for allowing Nazi content, to which I felt a tad bit responsible. So trying to be a good sport: <br>
<br>

<br>
That was my last comment before a 7 day ban for "untagged NSFW". The co-admin was Kek (how original) and he was the one that banned me without warning. Mistake #2. We had seen their butt Buddy Carpathianflorist spam NSFW gay gifs numerous times to troll the right, not once was he banned. So now I know I'm targeted. (Oy vey, why do they persecute me so??) <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/m4nvfr.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
The bias became more &amp; more obvious, gee whiz I wonder what group seizes power at the cost of all the others? The picture was forming, and I was careful not to accuse them of it. I wanted it to come out naturally, by their own actions they'd hang themselves. <br>
<br>
So I pressed on having theological discussion after discussion. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+AskRuqqus/post/2ihb/is-anybody-else-tired-of-all/8wrl?context=3" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+AskRuqqus/post/2ihb ... ?context=3</a><br>
<br>
I wasn't just arguing my point, like in poker, I was studying his tells. Read between the lines, how does he react? What counter points does he offer? Are they in line with my own? Or are they trying to stifle one agenda in order to push another? <br>
<br>
The pattern never changes. HitlerWasRight! <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/6ahcar.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
The best part is, they didn't even know they were agreeing with Nazis when I'd quote them. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/w1gd8p.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br>
<br>
This one is my real indicator of Hitler being right. This is Jewish Pilpul 101. Literally every Jewish doctrine is represented within one person. This is a guy (don't let the name fool you) that is very well versed in Pilpul. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/97e3jw.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br>
<br>
He takes both sides, tries deflecting, projecting, agrees but disagree, the very icon of controlled opposition. You'll see more of it later as the months progress. This is the closest example to Hitler's comment on debating jews. Read through it if you have the time. <br>

<br>
I've seen this IRL, it's very useful to recognize these signs.<br>
<br>
This one here, well... How could you not jump all over his shit? <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/8inl2g.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>

<br>
I really did enjoy this project. It was inspiring to know we can rise again. Watching the admins scramble to stop our momentum was comical. The kikes outed themselves. I even hosted a debate on the Holocaust. Guess who won? <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+HitlerWasRight/post/4znr/holocaust-debate-thread-do-your-worst" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+HitlerWasRight/post ... your-worst</a><br>
<br>
Then the pushback started. There were REEEEEs from the same people praising the admins for their free speech platform that were calling for censorship. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+general/post/5vzz/take-back-your-life-block-toxic" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+general/post/5vzz/t ... lock-toxic</a><br>
<br>

<br>
They were complaining that the front page was looking "like another Voat". So it's this push for self censorship that was the first domino for restricting free speech. The admins responded, Mistake #3. Now I know it's been coordinated, and the mask begins to slip. This was approaching Christmas and V1 was announced it was closing. I upped my scare tactic that "if you think the front page is bad now, just wait till my friends get here!" Once again, I goaded them into acting the way I knew they wanted to act. They just needed a reason. <br>
<br>
And sure enough... <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/0sno6x.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+changelog/post/5ywz/ruqqus-227-improved-content-filtering-guildmaster/ksep?context=3" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+changelog/post/5ywz ... ?context=3</a><br>
<br>
I had them. The admins just acted on behalf of a political minority. The admins that claim to be libertarian just acted like liberals wielding power. So a recap: <br>
<br>
- Admins created a site advertising free speech. They even had an MSM article report on it. <br>
<br>
- I come make thy debut, and start making waves. <br>
<br>
- My hate facts sparked censorship measures and frivolous banning. <br>
<br>
- A coordinated effort to stifle free expression was implemented to stop National Socialist friendly content from reaching the front page via sub categories that would make political content opt-in only, thus blinding it from new users.<br>
<br>
This brings about the snowball effect. More &amp; more users were becoming more hostile towards Nazis. They would break ToS to troll us, and never would get banned. If a NatSoc responded in kind, HE would get banned. Once again, goading for a reaction looking for an excuse to ban. Carpathianflorist was notorious for it, and I actually got him to admit he &amp; the admins were Jewish. When I cited it, he deleted his comment. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+DumpsterFire/post/5uh3/new-users-see-the-following-screen/kib3?context=3" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+DumpsterFire/post/5 ... ?context=3</a><br>
<br>
Note: They made it so people can hide on different usernames, for shekels of course. He went from Carpathianflorist, to Tranny, to Cap. <br>
<br>
He then let it slip what they were about to do when Voat shut down. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/thwjvb.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
This is a non-admin/mod mind you... I knew they took the bait so I predicted their censorship that was coming. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+general/post/5wvf/i-believe-ruqqus-is-dying/kh5i?context=3" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+general/post/5wvf/i ... ?context=3</a><br>
<br>
So then the big unveiling. Voat closes on Christmas Day, Ruqqus closed registration for new users "to prevent overloading servers" despite the fact they handled several reddit exoduses which never affected the performance. Then they falsely accused me of using alts to mod more than 10 subs and permabanned me. They gave all of my subs away to their Jewish cabal, who were quick to vandalize my beautiful National Socialist subs. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/rzz4qa.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+HijackedGuilds/post/6370/current-hijack-situation-update-in-hitlerwasright" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+HijackedGuilds/post ... erwasright</a><br>
<br>
Then an unexpected twist: I had a defense criticizing the admins from the last person on Ruqqus I ever expected: <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/635k/josephgoebbels-banned-for-using-alts-to/l4hv" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/ ... ts-to/l4hv</a><br>
<br>
Remember what I said about Pilpul? This is how real it gets. Literally question everything. Why would a staunch anti-Nazi defend me and criticize the Jewish admins? As it turns out, despite the commendable efforts and collecting of facts that exposed admin bias and dishonesty, that argument pattern didn't match when he argued in defending jews. Suddenly there was a shitload of facts and zero cognitive dissonance. I thought that a bit odd - crystal went from defending jews to being warned by admins he was about to get banned for a "harassment campaign". <br>
<br>
Odd indeed... <a href="https://ruqqus.com/+The_Cabal/post/66ia/the-admins-literally-discuss-site-bans" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+The_Cabal/post/66ia ... -site-bans</a><br>
<br>
Then it leaked, the admins were coordinating my persecution from the beginning. Just like in every communist uprising, it starts from corruption at the top. They leaked that my ban was coming before it happened on a separate site, discord. As it turns out, my downvotes were all from their brigading me &amp; using alts. The admin himself was busted using alts and would ban anyone calling him on it, citing "harassment". <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/69toep.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/7d3f58.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
The backlash was bad enough that the admins changed my permaban to a temporary 7 day ban, again on fraudulent charges. They never proved I was guilty, their "good word" was enough. I got my subs back, but had to fix and undo what they did. The mask slipped, they wanted war. It turns out, the kike cabal formed a group called RCP, Ruqqus Cleanup Project. It was designed to eliminate wrongthink. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/b6mb0w.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
So the admins had been thoroughly discredited, to which zero fucks were given. Even when their own devs left in protest they didn't apologize nor change their ways. Their arrogance is what gave them away. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://ruqqus.com/+RuqES/post/6c5g/ruqes-update-0280-new-ruqqie-reaction" class="postlink">https://ruqqus.com/+RuqES/post/6c5g/ruq ... e-reaction</a><br>
<br>
That lead me to question why they ran a site they could give two fucks about. It obviously wasn't free speech, nor did they care about public perception. Well, what motivates a jew if they already have power? I did some research and found out it was actually an LLC. As a former business owner, I knew a thing or two about it. <br>
<br>
They were using it as a money laundering site, they implemented gold coins (so much for being the anti-reddit) to cook the books for taxes, meanwhile... They can write off vehicles, gas, rent/mortgage, food purchase, and whatever toys they want to buy. It's a money making scheme, nothing more. <br>
<br>
Any business owner knows that your brand is you, you are your brand, and PR is everything. Your success depends on your demeanor, and you can risk all by going political. (Get woke, go broke). Yet there was zero concern here. If they don't rely on image to make the business go, then it's gotta be money laundering front company. <br>
<br>
Exposing this lead to my final ban lol. <br>

<br>
Now mind you, I never attacked their person or followed them around. They followed <strong class="text-strong">me</strong> around though, stalking my every post. I wasn't even on their post, in their sub, or addressing them when I got banned. All I did was expose their hypocrisy, dishonesty, and the fact they were jews running a money laundering scheme. Take a look at his reasoning for it. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/08ufl3.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
He flat out admitted to persecuting me all the while citing the Holocaust lol. Can you <strong class="text-strong">get</strong> any more Jewish than that? <br>
<br>
As far as the Pilpul expert, Crystalvulpine, it turns out he's also Jewish and modding their site for them, contributing coding work. The ban warning was just theater, no one else got a warning. Controlled opposition at its finest. They take all sides as to sway the narrative and the outcome. Stick to facts and the root of the problem, though... Then you got trouble.<br>
<br>
This is essentially history repeated, when all things are considered. They really were right. I set out to prove it to myself and they were more right than I could have imagined. <br>
<br>
This is why I preach to take your knowledge to bluepilled sites and scenarios. Teach the sheep. There is a silent majority lurking, desperately wanting to wake from their comas. The reward is most satisfying. The best way to learn is to teach.<br>

It's a real shame you don't post so much on NuVoat anymore. You should come back, fuck the pedos.

I had enough of the admin bullshit, I told TheVenerable he was acting just like Ruqqus admins. He's not mature enough to host a free speech site.</div>

So someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201128044137/https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusAdmin/post/2pws/jailbait-banned-for-sexualizing-minors" class="postlink">archived</a> that post back in 2020. The comment counter said 14 comments; yet, only 2 were shown. Does it mean that the other 12 were hidden?
</div></blockquote>

I'm not sure how, but he somehow hid several root comments along with the children, so there are 14 comments but unless you have the direct link, you won't be able to see them. When I click "context" I get a 404 Internet Gremlins lead you to a page that is not there message. So he did something to hide it.</div>

			<div class="content">Excellent post! I will nit pick and point out JFK was a staunch supporter of Israel and supported Jews running our banks (EO 11110 was to make getting rid of the gold standard for US citizens easier). The guy arguing "muh Brits were good guys" was retarded enough to annoy me. It's a fact accepted by even Jewish sources today Britain began bombing civilians for the purpose of sowing terror, not the Germans who tried to get the Brits to comply with the Geneva convention. Also Britain's only real allies were France and Portugal. The former decided to join Germany instead of Britain. I find it funny when people say Europe was liberated from Germany when only like the Dutch and the Soviets didn't willingly ally with Germany.<br>
As for your call to action at the end, I had a YouTube account I would comment with, as based as I could get it. I would waste time trying to expose the truth to sheep. I occasionally succeeded, the Jews I dealt with were usually Mossad, their tell is never shutting up. Other Jews tells were telling bold lies, than acting as described here when called out, and being generally nasty. I don't think you can educate 99% of their useful idiots. Nearly everyone believes in muh Hololocaust to the point where even if you prove it didn't happen (even though you shouldn't have to, it's their job to prove it did happen) to them, they'll reset the next day. One day without warning my account got terminated, I didn't know YouTube did for comments alone, but evidently they do. Hundreds of sources and excellent points, for nothing. Fun fact, the YouTube channel "Emperor Tigerstar" is run by a colossal faggot who believes neutering literal prepubescent children is okay and hates free speech, but people still watch him.</div>

Well,T-Bitty,the simple fact is that JFK may have lied about supporting the jews to get into office. I mean,they killed him for some reason. This is along the lines of the argument that simply because Churchill worked for the jews,he also loved them. Churchill probably hated those bastards more than Hitler ever did. Most people who know about the true nature of the jews do. If he could've taken them down without being dragged down with them,he'd have jumped at the chance. Stalin did. Of course,they got him back,but still.<br>

He didn't, his whole family staunchly supported them. I think this may be a rare case where the feds where being honest and he actually was killed by a communist, either that or it was so Johnson could pass a hundred civil rights acts since Kennedy failed/was less enthusiastic to do so without opposition. Churchill also openly supported the Jews, even if he didn't he was still a bad man who played into their hands. Frankly he was too drunk to have credible positions attributed to him though and he must be judged by his actions. Actions&gt;words&gt;possible thoughts. I covered JFK pretty thoroughly here: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2461" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2461</a></div>

And yet we have so many quotes that could only be about them. And Churchill was very clear he hated the jews. Working for someone doesn't mean you love them. And JFK being killed by a commie? Commies work for the jews. And Oswald was shot by a jew. Look at that grin as he's going into the court house. Does that look like a man who's going to swing for shooting a president? Or does that look like a man who's going to blow the whole thing wide open and walk away free? No matter how you slice it,it keeps coming back to jews.
</div></blockquote>
We have zero quotes of them naming anyone close to them. JFK's secret societies speech I talked about in my post, he asked Jews to further propagandize to people. Meanwhile in his campaign song he sucks Israel's dick. Churchill talked about Jews being oppressed by Germans. Let's compare that to Nixon and Patton who said Jews could not be trusted and were anti American. According to the Feds Oswald was a narcissist, fitting for a communist and a man who just shot the president. Granted I understand why one wouldn't trust the FBI's official account, but it is a very neatly crafted story if it's untrue. Oswald was then allegedly shot by an egotistical Jewish pimp who loved Kennedy. He very clearly wasn't killed for not supporting Jews though, because all his words and actions showed he supported them. The idea he might have secretly been against them without it being recorded is going to be hard to prove, especially since it contradicts what we know he said and did.</div>

			<div class="content">Do we know what he said and did? You're twisting his words to mean something when he was clearly talking about the jews. If Oswald killed JFK,why not let the courts PROVE it? Why leave it to speculation? You could've had a nice trial,you could have let Oswald hang,and you wouldn't have had to get Jack Ruby out of trouble,leading to more evidence of jewish conspiracy. There's no way to slice this that doesn't go back to jews.</div>

Well,T-Bitty,the simple fact is that JFK may have lied about supporting the jews to get into office. I mean,they killed him for some reason. This is along the lines of the argument that simply because Churchill worked for the jews,he also loved them. Churchill probably hated those bastards more than Hitler ever did. Most people who know about the true nature of the jews do. If he could've taken them down without being dragged down with them,he'd have jumped at the chance. Stalin did. Of course,they got him back,but still.<br>
<br>
I am,however,curious about ALS's statements on NuVoat. What's Venerable done there that's bullshit. I see nazi posts there all the time.
</div></blockquote>

The entire Kennedy family hated jews, hence the "Kennedy Curse". <br>
<br>
As far as .xyz it's his tolerance of pedoposting, and restrictions on votes preventing you from downvoting them. That and he doesn't act like a business owner, he acts like a reddit power mod when criticized. It's nothing to do with Nazi content, it's the way he restricts voting and calls names when criticized. He will retract your downvotes because he doesn't like that you downvoted someone, and you'll be restricted from downvoting them in the future. He has a very "I'll do WTF I want, it's MY site!" mentality. Putt never pulled that shit.</div>

Do we know what he said and did? You're twisting his words to mean something when he was clearly talking about the jews. If Oswald killed JFK,why not let the courts PROVE it? Why leave it to speculation? You could've had a nice trial,you could have let Oswald hang,and you wouldn't have had to get Jack Ruby out of trouble,leading to more evidence of jewish conspiracy. There's no way to slice this that doesn't go back to jews.
</div></blockquote>
Yes, we know for absolute certain. I'm not twisting anything, I have a whole post with links to his speeches that I sent you. You have to twist his words and actions to say he was against Jews. You can read them for yourself if you don't believe me. Because, again according to the flimsy word of the FBI, Jack Ruby killed Oswald because he loved Kennedy. Jack Ruby died before facing trial, so there was no getting him out of trouble. It's a pretty sound story, even if it's untrue. What evidence do you have he was against Jews? Besides him dying. Something that can actually be proven that he said or did. Besides that, if Jews were actually against him and he was against them why would they make him a martyr? Why not slander him and illegitimately overthrow him like Nixon who was actually against their crimes?</div>

Well,T-Bitty,the simple fact is that JFK may have lied about supporting the jews to get into office. I mean,they killed him for some reason. This is along the lines of the argument that simply because Churchill worked for the jews,he also loved them. Churchill probably hated those bastards more than Hitler ever did. Most people who know about the true nature of the jews do. If he could've taken them down without being dragged down with them,he'd have jumped at the chance. Stalin did. Of course,they got him back,but still.<br>
<br>
I am,however,curious about ALS's statements on NuVoat. What's Venerable done there that's bullshit. I see nazi posts there all the time.
</div></blockquote>

The entire Kennedy family hated jews, hence the "Kennedy Curse". <br>
<br>
As far as .xyz it's his tolerance of pedoposting, and restrictions on votes preventing you from downvoting them. That and he doesn't act like a business owner, he acts like a reddit power mod when criticized. It's nothing to do with Nazi content, it's the way he restricts voting and calls names when criticized. He will retract your downvotes because he doesn't like that you downvoted someone, and you'll be restricted from downvoting them in the future. He has a very "I'll do WTF I want, it's MY site!" mentality. Putt never pulled that shit.
</div></blockquote>
Which is why both JFK and Bobby Kennedy's campaigns were openly pro Israel? The latter was killed by Palestinian Lutheran Sirhan Sirhan for how pro Israel Bobby was. The former put support for Israel in his campaign song and received the vast majority of the Jewish vote. The curse is God himself was fed up with how sinful the Kennedy's were.</div>

No,he didn't. He died before his SECOND trial. He was found guilty in the first one. And we all know what happens to jews who "die" in prison. They retire to Israel. And a jew loving a gentile enough to risk throwing his life away to avenge him? You're insane. The only reason jews had to kill Oswald was because he knew something they couldn't let out. Something important enough they sent one of their own to deal with him.<br>

</div></blockquote>
Okay, second trial, same idea. A Jew acting as though he's above the law? Incredibly believable.<br>
I mean I've been trying to be nice and set you right, but it's clear you're a delusional retard. I sent you a thorough post about how much he loved Jews, you can't give a single example of him speaking out against Jews (because there aren't any). Either do some research or take your meds.<br>
I'll ask again, what evidence do you have besides possibly his death, which makes less since than smearing him, that JFK had a poor relationship with Jews and was actually lying all the times he spoke in favor of them?</div>

Well,T-Bitty,the simple fact is that JFK may have lied about supporting the jews to get into office. I mean,they killed him for some reason. This is along the lines of the argument that simply because Churchill worked for the jews,he also loved them. Churchill probably hated those bastards more than Hitler ever did. Most people who know about the true nature of the jews do. If he could've taken them down without being dragged down with them,he'd have jumped at the chance. Stalin did. Of course,they got him back,but still.<br>
<br>
I am,however,curious about ALS's statements on NuVoat. What's Venerable done there that's bullshit. I see nazi posts there all the time.
</div></blockquote>

The entire Kennedy family hated jews, hence the "Kennedy Curse". <br>
<br>
As far as .xyz it's his tolerance of pedoposting, and restrictions on votes preventing you from downvoting them. That and he doesn't act like a business owner, he acts like a reddit power mod when criticized. It's nothing to do with Nazi content, it's the way he restricts voting and calls names when criticized. He will retract your downvotes because he doesn't like that you downvoted someone, and you'll be restricted from downvoting them in the future. He has a very "I'll do WTF I want, it's MY site!" mentality. Putt never pulled that shit.
</div></blockquote>
Which is why both JFK and Bobby Kennedy's campaigns were openly pro Israel? The latter was killed by Palestinian Lutheran Sirhan Sirhan for how pro Israel Bobby was. The former put support for Israel in his campaign song and received the vast majority of the Jewish vote. The curse is God himself was fed up with how sinful the Kennedy's were.
</div></blockquote>

FDR hated jews, he was the most antisemitic president up until that time. Yet he appointed more jews to his cabinet than any president before him, and they called his economic plan "The Jew Deal" even insisting his real name was Rosenfeld. <br>
<br>
Acting a certain way to get into power is not unheard of. Kennedy wanted to end the Fed and admitted that he admired Hitler.</div>

The entire Kennedy family hated jews, hence the "Kennedy Curse". <br>
<br>
As far as .xyz it's his tolerance of pedoposting, and restrictions on votes preventing you from downvoting them. That and he doesn't act like a business owner, he acts like a reddit power mod when criticized. It's nothing to do with Nazi content, it's the way he restricts voting and calls names when criticized. He will retract your downvotes because he doesn't like that you downvoted someone, and you'll be restricted from downvoting them in the future. He has a very "I'll do WTF I want, it's MY site!" mentality. Putt never pulled that shit.
</div></blockquote>
Which is why both JFK and Bobby Kennedy's campaigns were openly pro Israel? The latter was killed by Palestinian Lutheran Sirhan Sirhan for how pro Israel Bobby was. The former put support for Israel in his campaign song and received the vast majority of the Jewish vote. The curse is God himself was fed up with how sinful the Kennedy's were.
</div></blockquote>

FDR hated jews, he was the most antisemitic president up until that time. Yet he appointed more jews to his cabinet than any president before him, and they called his economic plan "The Jew Deal" even insisting his real name was Rosenfeld. <br>
<br>
Acting a certain way to get into power is not unheard of. Kennedy wanted to end the Fed and admitted that he admired Hitler.
</div></blockquote>
FDR said he might be part Jewish himself and married his cousin who spoke Yiddish I believe, and I believe we discussed that before, though I won't give you a garuntee on all that. I will garuntee you Kennedy did not want to end the Fed because he took actions that directly supported it, EO 11110 (this is what I've seen people use to say Kennedy was against the fed: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110" class="postlink">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110</a>) was implemented specifically to make getting rid of the gold and silver standard for American citizens easier. Plus he gave Israel our weapons. Churchill also said he admired Hitler, but he clearly supported Jews more. While lying for political power is common, we would need an instance of Kennedy doing or saying something to prove this idea, not that he might have thought about it, especially when his words and actions we do know of suggest he deeply supported Jews.</div>

See,I don't have to offer proof when the proof you offer already proves my point for me. There is nothing in the executive order from your own link. FYI,it's better to link to the official record rather than FUCKING WIKIPEDIA,YOU COLLOSSAL FAGGOT!!!! Because the wiki page can be changed by anyone and official records are a little harder to change.<br>
<br>
But the point is,according to your own source,Kennedy was trying to transfer power AWAY from the federal reserve by allowing the minting of silver coins and issuing silver certs. Thus taking the power to print money away from the jews. Read the damn memo. Allow for more than your own retarded interpretation. THINK! IT!! THROUGH!!!
</div></blockquote>
Lmao you're retarded. I linked both the Wikipedia, which contains the order for you to read as well as background knowledge, AS WELL ANOTHER LINK WITH JUST THE OFFICIAL RECORD IN CASE YOU WERE TO BITCH ABOUT WIKIPEDIA WHEN THERE IS NO REASON FOR SOMEONE TO CHANGE SOMETHING SO MUNDANE ON IT EXCLAMATION POINT. He was stream lining the process of making it so money used by American citizens wouldn't be backed by silver or gold, he gave his authority to the secretary of the treasury for the sake of convenience. The dollar was exchangeable for silver before the order, the purpose of the order was to get rid of the silver standard and have Americans use FED NOTES instead. Do you lack all reading comprehension skills? That is the background of the order, the order itself was to make getting rid of silver easier because it was being used more in industry to fix the price according to Kennedy, silver was in circulation before the order. I have no idea how you got "Kennedy was trying to put silver in circulation" out of that. Kennedy explicitly said he wanted a baseless fed based currency, this order was for administration purposes and helped increase the Fed's power. For posterity: <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documen" class="postlink">https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documen</a> ... erformance<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110</a><br>
<br>
I'd ask you what evidence you have Kennedy was against the Jews again, but you can't read and since you haven't provided any yet I see that you aren't going to provide any. The burden of proof has been on you this entire time btw, you are yet to prove Kennedy said or did anything in secret that contradicted what he said and did publicly (everything the Jews wanted). I shouldn't have to prove a negative. Now I will ask why you liked him. Was it his sinful lifestyle? His corrupt family? His support of the anti white civil rights movement? His support of the 1965 immigration act? His support of the Vietnam war? Nearly ending the world because Kruschev thought he was a beta faggot? His loyalty to Israel? Stealing his election? There is simply nothing good about him as a president if not as a man.</div>

See,I don't have to offer proof when the proof you offer already proves my point for me. There is nothing in the executive order from your own link. FYI,it's better to link to the official record rather than FUCKING WIKIPEDIA,YOU COLLOSSAL FAGGOT!!!! Because the wiki page can be changed by anyone and official records are a little harder to change.<br>
<br>
But the point is,according to your own source,Kennedy was trying to transfer power AWAY from the federal reserve by allowing the minting of silver coins and issuing silver certs. Thus taking the power to print money away from the jews. Read the damn memo. Allow for more than your own retarded interpretation. THINK! IT!! THROUGH!!!
</div></blockquote>
Tl;Dr you are lying about what my sources and the order say. Kennedy said he wanted people to use baseless fed notes because silver was in high demand and the order was just to stream line that process. He and you are fags.</div>

Ok,I looked at your massive dump of a thread.<br>
<br>
No he didn't. I listened to the whole song and not one mention of Israel. You're linking to Politico articles,which is just fucking stupid. And your link to the official version was broken and I had to use the one in the thread and it says the same thing as the wiki. Which has no mention of the secretary of the treasury at all and simply says Kennedy wanted the right to issue silver coins and certs. There is no indication there he wanted to prevent people getting them.<br>
<br>
So you've lied about all this and stink of kosher.
</div></blockquote>
Damn, Mossad at it again. You have eyes retard? For anyone curious what a liar you are, it's fittingly at 1:09 where the song says (not word for word but it's what it means with the Israeli flag and lyrics) Jews have a right to Israel: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DoUiNxh6_0" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/7DoUiNxh6_0</a><br>
<br>
Ok where's your link Moshe? Right you don't have any because everything you've said is a lie. Hell I should have known from the start since you said Churchill wasn't a monstrous Jew puppet. I used one politico article that said the ON TAPE BASED ON JEWISH CRIMES Nixon may have been robbed (because he was), for a source like politico to say it lends greater credence to it than if a more right wing source had done it as politico will not have any bias for Nixon. Here it is again: <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story" class="postlink">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story</a> ... 960-214395<br>
<br>
The link is not broken: <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-11110-amendment-executive-order-no-10289-amended-relating-the-performance" class="postlink">https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documen ... erformance</a><br>
<img alt="😒" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f612.svg"><img alt="😒" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f612.svg"><img alt="😒" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f612.svg"><img alt="😒" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f612.svg"> shut the fuck up you inbred Jewish retard, that's literally what the amendment did, it's what it says too in not very retard friendly language. Of course it says the same thing as the Wiki, why would Wikipedia lie about something this mundane?<br>
Kennedy literally said in his economic report to Congress he wanted to prevent people from getting silver: <a href="https://archive.org/details/EconomicReportOfThePresidentJanuary1963/page/n21/mode/1up?view=theater" class="postlink">https://archive.org/details/EconomicRep ... ew=theater</a><br>
"Outside of coinage, silver has no monetary value."<br>
<br>
Because I cannot fathom anyone being as retarded as you, to deny the truth with zero evidence and lie about looking at sources, I can only assume you're a Jew. Actually maybe you are this retarded, you haven't quoted my posts once so I know you're responding. Either way everything you think you know about Kennedy has been proven (unnecessarily on my part) to be untrue, he was a fiend and a villain. If you could accept being wrong for once you could learn something.</div>

The entire Kennedy family hated jews, hence the "Kennedy Curse". <br>
<br>
As far as .xyz it's his tolerance of pedoposting, and restrictions on votes preventing you from downvoting them. That and he doesn't act like a business owner, he acts like a reddit power mod when criticized. It's nothing to do with Nazi content, it's the way he restricts voting and calls names when criticized. He will retract your downvotes because he doesn't like that you downvoted someone, and you'll be restricted from downvoting them in the future. He has a very "I'll do WTF I want, it's MY site!" mentality. Putt never pulled that shit.
</div></blockquote>
Which is why both JFK and Bobby Kennedy's campaigns were openly pro Israel? The latter was killed by Palestinian Lutheran Sirhan Sirhan for how pro Israel Bobby was. The former put support for Israel in his campaign song and received the vast majority of the Jewish vote. The curse is God himself was fed up with how sinful the Kennedy's were.
</div></blockquote>

FDR hated jews, he was the most antisemitic president up until that time. Yet he appointed more jews to his cabinet than any president before him, and they called his economic plan "The Jew Deal" even insisting his real name was Rosenfeld. <br>
<br>
Acting a certain way to get into power is not unheard of. Kennedy wanted to end the Fed and admitted that he admired Hitler.
</div></blockquote>
I'm still waiting for your examples and sources of when Kennedy contradicted his documented pro Jew persona, as the Fed example is not accurate.</div>

			<div class="content">It's an Israeli flag that's on screen for a few seconds. That's hardly the brown tonging you were screaming about. It's nothing more than a token gesture pretty much anyone who wants to keep his job does. This doesn't show JFK loved the jews. It shows he bent the knee because that's what it takes to get high office. We're not talking about token gestures,we're talking about loving the jews. It doesn't help you said it was in the SONG not the PICTURES. Be more clear. If this is the best proof you got,you're a fucking moron.<br>
<br>
I never said he wasn't. I just said he hated the jews. Once again,working for someone doesn't mean you like them. You need to grasp this concept or you're never going to move forward. Most people who work for the jews hate them. Once again,Stalin had the chance to go after them and he took it. He'd lived and worked with jews his whole life. Why would he turn on them if he loved them? He wouldn't have. There's a reason jews are paranoid about gentiles. And while Politico might not have a bias in favor of Nixon,they do have a bias against the truth. Which means they'll twist the story one way or another. Trying to set themselves up as controlled opposition,for example.<br>
<br>
Yes it was. I clicky and it no worky. Check it yourself,faggot. As for Wikipedia lying,they have a letter in German they claim is proof Hitler ordered the killing of jews. You run it through a translator and it's a general order to allow medical euthanasia on terminally ill people who'd prefer to die sooner rather than later. So yes,they would lie about something that mundane. Considering the double speak in that statement,it's hard to nail down what he meant. Was he trying to take silver off the market? If so,he did a shit job cause you can still buy silver. Or was he looking to horde government silver to make coins? It can go either way. And neither one shows he was for the federal reserve.<br>
<br>
Well,A) you haven't proven any such thing and B) that's not the point of the discussion. The point of the discussion was whether he loved the jews or not. All you've proven is he sucked up to jews just like every other politician. Not as much as Obama,so he's not the worst president. But you have to expect some ass kissing after the jews got the unlimited money cheat that is the Federal Reserve.</div>

I'm tired of your retarded Mossad ass.<br>
The song says "would you deny a man his right to land" with the Israeli flag. Retard.<br>
You said he hated Jews without any evidence, the evidence we do have, him working for them, unnecessarily proves your baseless claim wrong. It's your job to prove your claim. Retard.<br>
Stalin is the only real exception because he believed they were traitors (plus he would occasionally work against them before the doctors plot, like when he relegalized Christianity), Kennedy NEVER said anything like that. Retard.<br>
Okay where's the lie in that specific politico article? That Kennedy(s) and LBJ, both known for stealing elections, stole the 1960 election? Retard.<br>
I've clicked it 100 times, it must be your computer because I know for certain it works. Plus you said it said the same thing as the Wikipedia before so you are lying, you know it works. Retard.<br>
That's not mundane, the wording of EO 11110 is mundane. That point is moot because I provided you another working source that says the same thing. Retard.<br>
I literally linked you his economic address to Congress now where he says he wants to make it so the dollar is not exchangeable for silver because industries needed it, it was the opposite of hoarding silver and you can no longer trade your dollars for silver, buying it at a pawn shop is not the same. He stated he wanted to use fed notes instead of silver notes. Retard.<br>
I've proven it when I didn't have to ten times now. You have to PROVE your point. He sold Israel weapons, increased the Fed's power, support the civil rights movement and 1965 immigration act, was corrupt as fuck and was a man whore. He sucked up to Jews far more than Obama and is undeniably one of America's worst presidents. Nixon, Ford and Carter didn't suck up to Jews to get elected (though Carter arguably did as President), no one besides maybe FDR did before him. Kennedy had to steal his election and then sucked up to Jews as president. Retard.<br>
I honestly can't imagine anyone being as dumb as you, I've proven beyond any doubt JFK was an honorary kike. I can only assume you are Mossad. You argue the same points I've disproven without proving any of your own points. Fuck you for wasting my time.</div>

			<div class="content">Well,here's a buttload of quotes from Joe Kennedy and John F. As well as Jack Ruby explaining he killed Oswald to protect the jews. <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/UbJO1Wpwg2Kt/" class="postlink">https://www.bitchute.com/video/UbJO1Wpwg2Kt/</a><br>
<br>
Hitler supported Israel because he was hoping to dump all the jews in there and asked them many time to leave and go there. Support for Israel is not love for jews. In some cases,it's the exact opposite. And,once again,Joe knew he'd have to work with jews to get into the preisdency. And if he knew it,John knew it.<br>
<br>
I put forward JFK was killed by the jews. I've shown jewish hands in the crime via Jack Ruby. As stated,Ruby killed Oswald to protect jews,not out of love of a goyim. Do you know anything about jews? They hate non-jews. That's why most of the people working for them also hate them.<br>
<br>
Kennedy said lots of things like that. You're just ignoring them. They're all over this site. I don't know how you missed it.<br>
<br>
I don't know where the line is because I don't read Politico articles for the stated reasons. Were you not listening again? Seems to be a real problem with you. Must be the massive kike inbreeding acting up. But yeah "lying media outlet agrees with me" doesn't make that outlet suddenly good. It just means you're easily fooled.<br>
<br>
I told you I used the link in the megathread of bullshit you posted. THAT ONE worked. The one in the post before that didn't. You colossal faggaloon. Do you even know what's being said at this point? You argue like a jew.<br>
<br>
No,you cited a poorly worded second source that's also unclear. Kennedy says silver's only good for making coins and then the other part is vague in that it isn't clear if he's discontinuing making silver coins or not. If you were capable of thinking,you'd realize this is a valid concern. Instead,you double down and add the exact same insult over and over. Which stinks of kosher. Additionally,silver is traded on the stock market and in bulk,the only difference is you get the actual silver,not certs. So where's that whole "can't buy silver" thing going? No where? How shocking.<br>
<br>
Would you feel better if the jews simply stole them like they did the nukes? Everyone buys and sells to Israel. They're basically a nation of happy merchants. Are you sure it wasn't Johnson who did that? It seems like someone scared off his ass would. Lots of people supported Civil Rights. It was a popular movement. Just the kind of thing a politician would latch on to to get more popular. How could Kennedy support the 65 immigration act when he died in 63? Paying lip service is not the same thing as pushing it into law. As well,was that act even up for debate 2 years before it was ratified? Do your research,nigger. He got a chance to fuck Marilyn Monroe. Lots of people would've.<br>
<br>
You are a very one note faggot. But this whole time you've proven to me one thing. You're far more interested in demonizing Kennedy than realizing the core of the problem was and always will be the jews. You whip the slave but not his master. Which is a very pilpul thing to do and proves you're probably a jew plant. Bet you think Hitler was half jewish too. But thanks for exposing yourself,kike.</div>

Well,here's a buttload of quotes from Joe Kennedy and John F. As well as Jack Ruby explaining he killed Oswald to protect the jews. <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/UbJO1Wpwg2Kt/" class="postlink">https://www.bitchute.com/video/UbJO1Wpwg2Kt/</a><br>
<br>
Hitler supported Israel because he was hoping to dump all the jews in there and asked them many time to leave and go there. Support for Israel is not love for jews. In some cases,it's the exact opposite. And,once again,Joe knew he'd have to work with jews to get into the preisdency. And if he knew it,John knew it.<br>
<br>
I put forward JFK was killed by the jews. I've shown jewish hands in the crime via Jack Ruby. As stated,Ruby killed Oswald to protect jews,not out of love of a goyim. Do you know anything about jews? They hate non-jews. That's why most of the people working for them also hate them.<br>
<br>
Kennedy said lots of things like that. You're just ignoring them. They're all over this site. I don't know how you missed it.<br>
<br>
I don't know where the line is because I don't read Politico articles for the stated reasons. Were you not listening again? Seems to be a real problem with you. Must be the massive kike inbreeding acting up. But yeah "lying media outlet agrees with me" doesn't make that outlet suddenly good. It just means you're easily fooled.<br>
<br>
I told you I used the link in the megathread of bullshit you posted. THAT ONE worked. The one in the post before that didn't. You colossal faggaloon. Do you even know what's being said at this point? You argue like a jew.<br>
<br>
No,you cited a poorly worded second source that's also unclear. Kennedy says silver's only good for making coins and then the other part is vague in that it isn't clear if he's discontinuing making silver coins or not. If you were capable of thinking,you'd realize this is a valid concern. Instead,you double down and add the exact same insult over and over. Which stinks of kosher. Additionally,silver is traded on the stock market and in bulk,the only difference is you get the actual silver,not certs. So where's that whole "can't buy silver" thing going? No where? How shocking.<br>
<br>
Would you feel better if the jews simply stole them like they did the nukes? Everyone buys and sells to Israel. They're basically a nation of happy merchants. Are you sure it wasn't Johnson who did that? It seems like someone scared off his ass would. Lots of people supported Civil Rights. It was a popular movement. Just the kind of thing a politician would latch on to to get more popular. How could Kennedy support the 65 immigration act when he died in 63? Paying lip service is not the same thing as pushing it into law. As well,was that act even up for debate 2 years before it was ratified? Do your research,nigger. He got a chance to fuck Marilyn Monroe. Lots of people would've.<br>
<br>
You are a very one note faggot. But this whole time you've proven to me one thing. You're far more interested in demonizing Kennedy than realizing the core of the problem was and always will be the jews. You whip the slave but not his master. Which is a very pilpul thing to do and proves you're probably a jew plant. Bet you think Hitler was half jewish too. But thanks for exposing yourself,kike.
</div></blockquote>
How much they pay you Mossad?<br>
<br>
After all this time the only source you give is one of JFK's face on screen for two minutes with shitty music playing? While complaining about my sources that are official documents of what Kennedy said? Your source is clearly bullshit which anyone with half a brain could see. Ruby told witnesses he killed Oswald on JFK's behalf, while in jail he started acting schizophrenic and claimed the government was killing 22 million Jews, he never said he killed Oswald for the Jews (at least not on record). If JFK was anti Jewish he'd be slandered today, but he isn't, he's treated as one of America's greatest presidents in academia.<br>
<br>
Hitler proved supporting Israel was foolish, everyone who's done it after is a kike, especially you. No, for the millionth time in 1960 supporting Jews to get elected was unnecessary. Nixon did it three times just fine. Plus even if it was necessary JFK should have stopped doing it as president.<br>
<br>
It is your job in this argument to prove Kennedy said things against the Jews, and not with shitty Bitchute videos. Not mine to look around the website. And besides that where? The Great Awakening schlomo?<br>
<br>
"I didn't read the article to know if it's true" "you have trouble listening." Kill yourself.<br>
<br>
Lmao it's been the same link everytime. You are undeniably a Jew.<br>
<br>
Poorly wording being the official transcripts. For a Jew I'd think you'd understand economics. Your dollar is no longer backed by silver because Kennedy got rid of it. You're really claiming your dollar is backed by silver now? When it's not. Or are trying to pivot what is being said Juden?<br>
<br>
Ah yes, Kennedy giving away our state of the art missiles is okay because Israel didn't steal them... Without permission. Wow I just hit the Jewish bingo! Kosher! We got "claims the unpopular anti white Civil rights movement was popular," "claims speaking in favor of something isn't a sign of support (also JFK only paid lip service for everything as president because he was too incompetent to accomplish ANYTHING as president, LBJ carried out everything JFK wanted)," and "claims being unfaithful is normal, bonus for it being an ugly kikette." What do I win?<br>
<br>
It's clear I dislike you Jews. Meanwhile you support Israel, the civil rights movement, degeneracy, and lying. This is for the benefit of any non Jews reading that they know Kennedy was nothing but a kike puppet and that they may see how Jews debate.</div>

I was looking through some of your other posts, you do the same shit here else where. I'm positive you must be a fed, my favorites are "Trump suspended the Patriot Act, I won't prove it though you have to prove a negative lol," and "I'm thinking of assassinating politicians." Clear fed confirmed, more proof JFK was a puppet that this was worth your tax payer funded time.</div>

			<div class="content">Oh,you're one of Tallest Shill's alts. That explains a lot. I'm still waiting for proof they've reinstated the Patriot Act. That's not a "negative". That's simply showing it has. They have to make a public statement if they reinstate a law. Find it. If they haven't done it by now,I doubt they're going to. It's a pretty unpopular piece so they'll probably just slip in a new "patriot act plus" in some pork bill Biden will gladly sign. Even at that,the Patriot Act is still not in effect.<br>
<br>
Oh,what happened to Nixon? Resigned in disgrace,his political career destroyed? Guess you do need jewish support,huh. And expressing anger is not a death threat. But I can't expect a brainlet jew to understand that. And what's that saying? "Only Nixon can go to China"? I wonder what that means. Nixon did just as much for the jews as the rest of 'em. They all bend the knee. That doesn't imply love.<br>
<br>
Well,now that I know you're TS,I'd say you're just lying now. You've been around too long not to have noticed them. And we both know you don't work on proof.<br>
<br>
I don't know why the link didn't work on that post but it didn't. You figure it out,your post.<br>
<br>
I don't bother reading posts from bad sources. Certainly not as proof of anything being true. Your shilling for bad news sites speaks volumes.<br>
<br>
I'm saying my dollars can buy silver. And they can. Pay attention,kike or you'll keep making a fool of yourself.<br>
<br>
Israel gets our shit regardless of legality. It's part and parcel to living with jews. How do you not know that?<br>
<br>
Civil rights was a popular movement. At least as far as the media was concerned. And that's all it takes to fool people.<br>
<br>
I said speaking in favor of something isn't a sign of love. Get it right,dipshit.<br>
<br>
So you're saying you wouldn't have banged the hell out of Marilyn Monroe? Well,I always suspected you're gay. Now I have proof.<br>
<br>
Slander doesn't work here. I'd think you're have figured that out by now.<br>
<br>
So,got any other bullshit,shill?</div>

Oh,you're one of Tallest Shill's alts. That explains a lot. I'm still waiting for proof they've reinstated the Patriot Act. That's not a "negative". That's simply showing it has. They have to make a public statement if they reinstate a law. Find it. If they haven't done it by now,I doubt they're going to. It's a pretty unpopular piece so they'll probably just slip in a new "patriot act plus" in some pork bill Biden will gladly sign. Even at that,the Patriot Act is still not in effect.<br>
<br>
Oh,what happened to Nixon? Resigned in disgrace,his political career destroyed? Guess you do need jewish support,huh. And expressing anger is not a death threat. But I can't expect a brainlet jew to understand that. And what's that saying? "Only Nixon can go to China"? I wonder what that means. Nixon did just as much for the jews as the rest of 'em. They all bend the knee. That doesn't imply love.<br>
<br>
Well,now that I know you're TS,I'd say you're just lying now. You've been around too long not to have noticed them. And we both know you don't work on proof.<br>
<br>
I don't know why the link didn't work on that post but it didn't. You figure it out,your post.<br>
<br>
I don't bother reading posts from bad sources. Certainly not as proof of anything being true. Your shilling for bad news sites speaks volumes.<br>
<br>
I'm saying my dollars can buy silver. And they can. Pay attention,kike or you'll keep making a fool of yourself.<br>
<br>
Israel gets our shit regardless of legality. It's part and parcel to living with jews. How do you not know that?<br>
<br>
Civil rights was a popular movement. At least as far as the media was concerned. And that's all it takes to fool people.<br>
<br>
I said speaking in favor of something isn't a sign of love. Get it right,dipshit.<br>
<br>
So you're saying you wouldn't have banged the hell out of Marilyn Monroe? Well,I always suspected you're gay. Now I have proof.<br>
<br>
Slander doesn't work here. I'd think you're have figured that out by now.<br>
<br>
So,got any other bullshit,shill?
</div></blockquote>
There are many ropes to hang oneself fed boy.<br>
<br>
Loses argument, accuses me of being an alt. Lmao. Smart ignoring me bringing up your literal fed posting though. It's your job to prove America's third biggest kike president, Donald Trump, got rid of the Patriot Act, not mine to prove he didn't. Surely you learned that in law school.<br>
<br>
What happened to Nixon? He won over 60% of the popular vote, resigned because Kennedy's Jewish friends (muh secret societies speech) lied about Watergate. Kennedy NEVER criticized Jews, Nixon did, he called them traitors. Nixon went to China to turn them against the bigger threat, at the time, the Soviet Union, and succeeded. Not all of them try to do everything Jews want though, unlike Kennedy.<br>
<br>
I don't browse fed operations like the Great Awakening, and since he has no quotes against the Jews I'm not going to see him elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Because you're lying? Again.<br>
<br>
You don't read, you provided no sources to prove your claim Kennedy hated Jews when in a debate you HAVE to. Pretending sources like that existed, but I unnecessarily proved they don't.<br>
<br>
<img alt="😒" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f612.svg"> on the 2% chance you're not a fed actually kill yourself, you're too stupid to be considered a person. Your dollar is not backed by silver. You can buy a car, your dollar is not backed by cars either. The audacity you have to try and insult me when you say stupid shit like that.<br>
<br>
I wonder who ramped up that issue. Could it be John "Jews have a right to endless power" Kennedy?<br>
<br>
No one was fooled until God himself killed Kennedy.<br>
<br>
You gonna pivot again schlomo? Kennedy saying he supported the 1965 immigration act is a sign he supported it. Quit your weaseling.<br>
<br>
You're a degenerate, you gave your mind and soul to Satan. Also I find all you Jews ugly. No one on the right would agree with your support of promiscuity, you're a shitty agent.<br>
<br>
Thanks for proving Jews loved Kennedy MIGA boy.</div>

The Fed spergs out when caught. Everything I said was an officially sourced fact while you provided no sources. So when are you assassinating politicians for Rabbi Trump? And can I get your local police department's phone number? I'd ask for yours too but I know they're the same. Don't worry I'm Q anon you can trust me lol. Who's everyone?

I'm not Tallest Skill. Will you accuse everyone who whoops your ass in a debate of being his alt? And try harder fed, I literally wrote a whole ass book to address your points, you went into schizo mode instead of addressing them. After I pointed out you were a terrible FBI agent that is, being unfaithful for one of your inbred whores is unacceptable among the right.</div>

As you should because it's insane to think otherwise. You're schizophrenic for a fed, you can go re-read the thread, it's clear I addressed everything while you sucked Zionist dick.</div>

Of course that's what happened,you poor deluded jew. It's obvious to anyone who reads the thread you're totally not a straw manning faggot jew who's slandering JFK to black pill people. Your rabbi's going to be very angry with you,TS.
</div></blockquote>
You're stuck on repeat. You neither used straw manning or slandering right, the former because I only addressed the things you said and the latter because everything I said about JFK was undeniably true, because he said it himself which I let you see. Dispelling your delusions/lies is not black pilling. Remember when you said you'd be unfaithful for an ugly Jew? Still not Tallest Skill and you still haven't proven Rabbi Trump removed the Patriot Act. Schizo.</div>

Also basic knowledge of debating shows you lost. You never used a source to prove what you were saying. You instead relied on a hypothetical that wasn't even good. Then you denied facts. Now you're determined to get the last word to feel a little better.</div>

			<div class="content">Always accuse your opponent of what you're doing,eh? You jews and your projections. Ok,let's compare what I said to what you believe I said. I said "JFK hated the jews." You then started screaming like a deranged faggot that "he totally worked for the jews". Which is not the same thing. As stated,several times now,working with someone doesn't mean you love them. It means you put up with them to get what you want. Or are you going to tell me you've loved every coworker,business partner,and boss you ever had? Go ahead,lie to me more. We all know that's what jews do.<br>
<br>
You made wild ass claims that Jack Ruby killed Oswald "out of love for JFK". Which goes against everything we know about jews and makes no sense. Oswald was already in custody and about to be tried. Why not let the justice system,WHICH THE JEWS ALREADY OWNED BY THEN,do it's job and convict him? Why shoot him and make the hand of the jews in the whole affair obvious? You've never answered this question other than to repeat Jack had a massive man crush on JFK. Which you haven't proven. I at least had quotes from a guy who talked to him and claimed he admitted he did it to protect the jews. Protect them from what? Take a wild fucking guess,moron.<br>
<br>
Your "proof" he was working to empower the fed didn't prove anything. It is,once again,very vague and JFK could've been planning to issue silver coins. He did say that's all it was good for. Yet,you ignore this and keep screaming like a howler monkey that he was totally down with the fed. Again,with no proof other than vague wording and nothing solid. It's just how you interpreted it. Once again,you can still buy silver with fed money. So if that was his plan,it failed massively. And even if you did prove he was trying to empower the fed,what difference does it make in the original discussion,how he felt about the jews? And you still haven't answered as to why the jews killed him if he wasn't fucking with their means of power. If he was such a good goy,why'd they murder him?<br>
<br>
And you won't answer these questions because you refuse to look at the root of the problem. The jews. JFK is dead. He's a moot point. The jews are alive and still fucking up our shit. But for some reason,it's vital to you to slander JFK like the media hasn't been doing that for a long time.<br>

You are a bad jew,TS. You always were. Give it up.</div>

I'm still waiting for your examples and sources of when Kennedy contradicted his documented pro Jew persona, as the Fed example is not accurate.
</div></blockquote>

When I'm back from vacation and have less spotty internet service, I'll get back to you. For now, rest assured he was a marked man by jew communists. The day before he was assassinated, 2 jews from New York drove all the way down to Texas and took out a full page ad bashing JFK. This after Castro held a "Hate America" parade, depicting JFK in a coffin. <br>
<br>
Oswald was a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a group of communist loving Castroites.

Okay, I will wait for your response when you get back from vacation.

Re: EO 11110<br>
<br>
JFK was clearly opposed to the secret society of international bankers. They have controlled the government long since before Kennedy. On June 4th, 1963 President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110 which gave the right to print currency for gold and silver bullion. With all the silver the US Treasury, the government would be able to introduce millions if independent, interest free currency into circulation essentially cutting the Banking Cartels completely out of the game. 5 months later, he was assassinated and no more bills were printed. <br>
<br>
Two months later when LBJ gave gave his state of the union address he enacted the "Economic Opportunity Act of 1964" which was sold to us as the solution to economic despair and poverty. However all it did was give the Federal Government more control over the currency. Face it, the elite society of bankers at the top of the pyramid control it all. Only one other President in US history sought to establish and independent, interest/debt free currency through the government (a power originally given solely to the government in the Constitution). Abraham Lincoln established exactly this with the famous "Green Back" currency which also would have cut the bankers out of their monopoly, and thus the empire. A short while afterwards, John Wilkes Booth, alleged K.G.C. member murders Lincoln and shouts "sic semper tyrannis," translated: "Long live the tyranny" or "thus always to tyrants". Booth was Jewish. <br>
<br>
That's just part of it, the real reason was he wanted to inspect Israel's nuclear weapons program. <br>

<br>
You are a bad jew,TS. You always were. Give it up.
</div></blockquote>
You're literally retarded, anyone can go back and see that you're lying. You HAVE TO PROVE JFK HATED JEWS you HAVEN'T. I unnecessarily pointed out all his words, actions, friends, and family supported them, despite the fact you never proved your original claim which in a debate you have to do first. I believe you first said "well the fact is he MIGHT have..." which only proved you were a dumbass from the start. Then what did JFK get out of it? Besides slamming through his official corrupt anti white agenda.<br>
<br>
That is the official reason according to the FBI, the courts, and first hand witness testimony. It makes sense that a Jew would defend a degenerate and believe he'd be above the law. No, you have no quotes from anyone. You want to know what Ruby actually said in jail? I told you already, "muh chosen people are being oppressed!" A very believable response.<br>
<br>
JFK's official speech to Congress where he said we needed to stop using silver notes because silver was needed by industries and that we should use fed notes instead is vague? No, you're just illiterate. Oh my fucking God, if you aren't a fed you really are the dumbest mother fucker on the planet. We HAD silver coins before Kennedy. Buying silver is not the same as having a currency backed by silver. You haven't PROVEN that the Jews killed JFK, I have proven through JFK's own words and actions he was their bitch, like you.<br>
<br>
I've answered these questions a million times now. You haven't answered what good thing Kennedy said or did, why you fed post, where you hear your nonsense, why you think being unfaithful for a JEW is okay, and haven't provided one good source (you did provide one shitty one though). "Slander," every single word I have said is true and sources. JFK was an anti white degenerate with a criminal family who deserves no respect. I clearly hate Jews but you support Israel and violating the sanctity of marriage for ugly Jews. The media talks shit about JFK? Actually laughing my fucking ass off now, the media gives him NOTHING but praise. Try and send me three good links that prove me wrong. You know who the media does talk shit about and is on tape recording saying Jews couldn't be trusted? I'll give you a hint, he whooped John Faggot Kennedy in 1960. And no I'm not @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=557" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">Tallest_Skil</a> for pointing out you still haven't provided any evidence Rabbi Trump removed the Patriot Act because shocker, the third biggest Jew puppet never did that.<br>
<br>
And one more thing, making it so I get a notification, it's super simple.</div>

When I'm back from vacation and have less spotty internet service, I'll get back to you. For now, rest assured he was a marked man by jew communists. The day before he was assassinated, 2 jews from New York drove all the way down to Texas and took out a full page ad bashing JFK. This after Castro held a "Hate America" parade, depicting JFK in a coffin. <br>
<br>
Oswald was a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a group of communist loving Castroites.

Okay, I will wait for your response when you get back from vacation.

Re: EO 11110<br>
<br>
JFK was clearly opposed to the secret society of international bankers. They have controlled the government long since before Kennedy. On June 4th, 1963 President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110 which gave the right to print currency for gold and silver bullion. With all the silver the US Treasury, the government would be able to introduce millions if independent, interest free currency into circulation essentially cutting the Banking Cartels completely out of the game. 5 months later, he was assassinated and no more bills were printed. <br>
<br>
Two months later when LBJ gave gave his state of the union address he enacted the "Economic Opportunity Act of 1964" which was sold to us as the solution to economic despair and poverty. However all it did was give the Federal Government more control over the currency. Face it, the elite society of bankers at the top of the pyramid control it all. Only one other President in US history sought to establish and independent, interest/debt free currency through the government (a power originally given solely to the government in the Constitution). Abraham Lincoln established exactly this with the famous "Green Back" currency which also would have cut the bankers out of their monopoly, and thus the empire. A short while afterwards, John Wilkes Booth, alleged K.G.C. member murders Lincoln and shouts "sic semper tyrannis," translated: "Long live the tyranny" or "thus always to tyrants". Booth was Jewish. <br>
<br>
That's just part of it, the real reason was he wanted to inspect Israel's nuclear weapons program. <br>

All these will basically say the same thing, but Kennedy himself said he wanted to get rid of the silver standard because industries needed more silver. The order itself was for administration purposes (so nothing anyone would really care about) to stream line the process. Kennedy supported fed notes. I don't know about Lincoln as well, I do know he passed that so the union could afford to fight the Civil War though. I know Andrew Jackson also hated banks and I'm pretty sure other presidents did too.<br>
<br>
Kennedy did want to inspect Israel's nuclear program at the time, however Israel's prime minister at the time of JFK's death (Levi Eshkol, if his predecessor was Kissinger he'd be Bernie Sanders) didn't really want nukes and instead wanted US protection (which JFK supported).<br>
<br>
If you're interested I did detail some retarded things JFK did here, aptly named dare I say: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2461" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2461</a></div>

How the fuck do you use link embedding here. I thought this was just a vBulletin derivative that would use the same formatting, but nope. Apparently I can’t put a link behind text. Whatever.<br>
<br>
To speak to the topic of the conversation, I could have sworn that the Kennedy family (before JFK) did in fact know, name, and hate the jews. Indeed, there’s strong evidence that he was assassinated specifically because he was going to force Israel to destroy its nuclear facilities to keep it from getting bombs. Whether this was out of a personal hatred for jews (having been raised in that environment) is, of course, without evidence to this day. Though the report on his assassination has explicit testimony that jews paid for the operation…</div>

I wonder how stupid someone would have to be to accuse me of having multiple accounts when I have <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/%5Burl%5D%5Burl%5D%5Burl%5D%5Burl%5D%5Burl%5D%5Burl%5D%5Burl%5Da%20history%20of%20hating%20that%20shit" class="postlink">[url][url][url][url][url][url][url]a hi ...  that shit</a>[/url][/url][/url][/url][/url][/url][/url]. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/ProtectVoat/3744862" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/ProtectVoat/3744862</a> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/ProtectVoat/3797681" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/ProtectVoat/3797681</a><br>

How the fuck do you use link embedding here. I thought this was just a vBulletin derivative that would use the same formatting, but nope. Apparently I can’t put a link behind text. Whatever.<br>
<br>
To speak to the topic of the conversation, I could have sworn that the Kennedy family (before JFK) did in fact know, name, and hate the jews. Indeed, there’s strong evidence that he was assassinated specifically because he was going to force Israel to destroy its nuclear facilities to keep it from getting bombs. Whether this was out of a personal hatred for jews (having been raised in that environment) is, of course, without evidence to this day. Though the report on his assassination has explicit testimony that jews paid for the operation…
</div></blockquote>
Because I brought up the fact merlynn132 has a history of not proving his outlandish claims, like when he made the claim Zion Don repelled the Patriot Act. At most Kennedy's father didn't want war with Germany, because why would he? Germany hadn't done anything wrong. Otherwise his family was notoriously corrupt. Ted Kennedy got away with drowning his mistress and Bobby Kennedy was killed by Palestinian Lutheran Sirhan Sirhan because Bobby wanted to give Israel bombers.<br>
<br>
Kennedy wanted to investigate Israel's nuclear piles while Levi Eshkol was prime minister, if his predecessor was Kissinger he was Bernie Sanders. He was okay with giving up nukes for American protection, which Kennedy supported. He in fact supported Israel during his campaign. The official narrative is that Jack Ruby, a Jewish Pimp, loved the anti white degenerate Kennedy and believed he could get away with avenging him after the egotistical communist Oswald killed him. The FBI claims this so I can understand someone not trusting it because of that. However first hand witnesses also claimed this so I'm a bit more at ease. My theory is since Kennedy wasn't a competent president the Jews wanted to martyr him so LBJ could pass the bills JFK failed to or was less enthusiastic to. Or the FBI is actually telling the truth for once.<br>

Re: EO 11110<br>
<br>
JFK was clearly opposed to the secret society of international bankers. They have controlled the government long since before Kennedy. On June 4th, 1963 President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110 which gave the right to print currency for gold and silver bullion. With all the silver the US Treasury, the government would be able to introduce millions if independent, interest free currency into circulation essentially cutting the Banking Cartels completely out of the game. 5 months later, he was assassinated and no more bills were printed. <br>
<br>
Two months later when LBJ gave gave his state of the union address he enacted the "Economic Opportunity Act of 1964" which was sold to us as the solution to economic despair and poverty. However all it did was give the Federal Government more control over the currency. Face it, the elite society of bankers at the top of the pyramid control it all. Only one other President in US history sought to establish and independent, interest/debt free currency through the government (a power originally given solely to the government in the Constitution). Abraham Lincoln established exactly this with the famous "Green Back" currency which also would have cut the bankers out of their monopoly, and thus the empire. A short while afterwards, John Wilkes Booth, alleged K.G.C. member murders Lincoln and shouts "sic semper tyrannis," translated: "Long live the tyranny" or "thus always to tyrants". Booth was Jewish. <br>
<br>
That's just part of it, the real reason was he wanted to inspect Israel's nuclear weapons program. <br>

All these will basically say the same thing, but Kennedy himself said he wanted to get rid of the silver standard because industries needed more silver. The order itself was for administration purposes (so nothing anyone would really care about) to stream line the process. Kennedy supported fed notes. I don't know about Lincoln as well, I do know he passed that so the union could afford to fight the Civil War though. I know Andrew Jackson also hated banks and I'm pretty sure other presidents did too.<br>
<br>
Kennedy did want to inspect Israel's nuclear program at the time, however Israel's prime minister at the time of JFK's death (Levi Eshkol, if his predecessor was Kissinger he'd be Bernie Sanders) didn't really want nukes and instead wanted US protection (which JFK supported).<br>
<br>

It's an interesting take, but...<br>
<br>
1. The support for Israel in that song is too vague to really call it support, it's not like he came out and said "We're only in the middle east to support Israel". <br>
<br>

<br>
I would call him a puppet that hated his handlers, but I also know that anyone smeared in the Jewish press probably acted against them somehow. He may have been crooked, but objectively, can those claims actually be proven? Treat it like court, will it stand up to scrutiny? <br>
<br>
2. The Cuban Missile Crisis being evidence of anything as it was a massive farce. To support your point, it was to protect the overthrow of Cuba and guarantee Castro took power. All the rest was just theater to hypnotize the masses into becoming fear ridden sheep. Also, that EO 11110 doesn't really specify that getting silver out of currency was the goal. <br>
<br>
3. The Civil War was funded by jews on both sides, and it was a jew that killed Lincoln. Many believe it was because he was supposed to free the slaves but instead he was going to ship them back to Africa and that would have ruined plans for jew bankers to subvert and weaken their host. Every president who actually served the people waged war against a national bank. Each one of them can be found on the currency of our national dollars, sort of an "in your face" gloat. <br>
<br>
4. No one mentions the Vietnam war. JFK was going to pull troops out of Vietnam, and no sooner Johnson was sworn in, he reversed his decision. He was "Re-evaluating his re-evaluation". <br>
<br>
That said, a patriot I trust the most from that era, called JFK a cryptocommie. He sabotaged the Bay of Pigs which would have gotten rid of the communist infiltrators in Cuba. But as I've stated, many Jewish handlers hate their bosses and wish to overthrow them as Stalin did. Usually the aftermath is the smear campaign in the press. They love claiming he was having an affair with Marilyn Monroe, who was Jewish, yet there wasn't any actual proof of it. I'm not saying it didn't happen, it very well could have been a Jewish plant to set him up for blackmail, like Clinton and Monica, who was also Jewish. <br>
<br>
The FBI back then is not the FBI you see today. They were a lot more honest in their efforts and actively exposed communist plots. The thing about that is, they don't have the power to prosecute anybody, the Justice Department has to do it based on their findings. They can only investigate. <br>

Re: EO 11110<br>
<br>
JFK was clearly opposed to the secret society of international bankers. They have controlled the government long since before Kennedy. On June 4th, 1963 President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110 which gave the right to print currency for gold and silver bullion. With all the silver the US Treasury, the government would be able to introduce millions if independent, interest free currency into circulation essentially cutting the Banking Cartels completely out of the game. 5 months later, he was assassinated and no more bills were printed. <br>
<br>
Two months later when LBJ gave gave his state of the union address he enacted the "Economic Opportunity Act of 1964" which was sold to us as the solution to economic despair and poverty. However all it did was give the Federal Government more control over the currency. Face it, the elite society of bankers at the top of the pyramid control it all. Only one other President in US history sought to establish and independent, interest/debt free currency through the government (a power originally given solely to the government in the Constitution). Abraham Lincoln established exactly this with the famous "Green Back" currency which also would have cut the bankers out of their monopoly, and thus the empire. A short while afterwards, John Wilkes Booth, alleged K.G.C. member murders Lincoln and shouts "sic semper tyrannis," translated: "Long live the tyranny" or "thus always to tyrants". Booth was Jewish. <br>
<br>
That's just part of it, the real reason was he wanted to inspect Israel's nuclear weapons program. <br>

All these will basically say the same thing, but Kennedy himself said he wanted to get rid of the silver standard because industries needed more silver. The order itself was for administration purposes (so nothing anyone would really care about) to stream line the process. Kennedy supported fed notes. I don't know about Lincoln as well, I do know he passed that so the union could afford to fight the Civil War though. I know Andrew Jackson also hated banks and I'm pretty sure other presidents did too.<br>
<br>
Kennedy did want to inspect Israel's nuclear program at the time, however Israel's prime minister at the time of JFK's death (Levi Eshkol, if his predecessor was Kissinger he'd be Bernie Sanders) didn't really want nukes and instead wanted US protection (which JFK supported).<br>
<br>
If you're interested I did detail some retarded things JFK did here, aptly named dare I say: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2461" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2461</a>

It's an interesting take, but...<br>
<br>
1. The support for Israel in that song is too vague to really call it support, it's not like he came out and said "We're only in the middle east to support Israel". <br>
<br>

<br>
I would call him a puppet that hated his handlers, but I also know that anyone smeared in the Jewish press probably acted against them somehow. He may have been crooked, but objectively, can those claims actually be proven? Treat it like court, will it stand up to scrutiny? <br>
<br>
2. The Cuban Missile Crisis being evidence of anything as it was a massive farce. To support your point, it was to protect the overthrow of Cuba and guarantee Castro took power. All the rest was just theater to hypnotize the masses into becoming fear ridden sheep. Also, that EO 11110 doesn't really specify that getting silver out of currency was the goal. <br>
<br>
3. The Civil War was funded by jews on both sides, and it was a jew that killed Lincoln. Many believe it was because he was supposed to free the slaves but instead he was going to ship them back to Africa and that would have ruined plans for jew bankers to subvert and weaken their host. Every president who actually served the people waged war against a national bank. Each one of them can be found on the currency of our national dollars, sort of an "in your face" gloat. <br>
<br>
4. No one mentions the Vietnam war. JFK was going to pull troops out of Vietnam, and no sooner Johnson was sworn in, he reversed his decision. He was "Re-evaluating his re-evaluation". <br>
<br>
That said, a patriot I trust the most from that era, called JFK a cryptocommie. He sabotaged the Bay of Pigs which would have gotten rid of the communist infiltrators in Cuba. But as I've stated, many Jewish handlers hate their bosses and wish to overthrow them as Stalin did. Usually the aftermath is the smear campaign in the press. They love claiming he was having an affair with Marilyn Monroe, who was Jewish, yet there wasn't any actual proof of it. I'm not saying it didn't happen, it very well could have been a Jewish plant to set him up for blackmail, like Clinton and Monica, who was also Jewish. <br>
<br>
The FBI back then is not the FBI you see today. They were a lot more honest in their efforts and actively exposed communist plots. The thing about that is, they don't have the power to prosecute anybody, the Justice Department has to do it based on their findings. They can only investigate. <br>
<br>

1. I mean for the 1960s that would be about the equivalent of it, back then you could probably still boycott Israel (at least you were able to back then in my state). It's so out of place for a generic American add of that time, but yes, that would be mandatory for a politician today.<br>
I've only heard the press praise him, but I'll try to continue point by point.<br>
<br>
2. Okay, fair enough on Cuba. I just added that to show he wasn't a good president, which that point would still stand. It just wouldn't prove anything about his relationship with Jews. That was the Kennedy's expressed goal as he stated before Congress, EO 11110 just made it so the Secretary of the Treasury could speed up the process.<br>
<br>
3. Mostly true. I'm unaware of Polk fighting a bank but I'd say he definitely served Americans. Same with some other presidents. But yes, you're largely right here.<br>
<br>
4. Kennedy sent the troops to Vietnam, he called them "advisors," my uncle was one. LBJ started the draft but as stated, Kennedy started sending the troops. He supported America being the global police force in his "ask not what your country can do for you, ask what your country at your expense can do for other countries" speech. I believe I linked it, let me know if I didn't.<br>
<br>
5. If we assume Marilyn Monroe was a smear we still have to acknowledge Kennedy was still a man whore, which we have proof of. All the big media companies praise him, unlike say Nixon. I hear the New York Times was saying back in 2013 that Kennedy was killed by right wing extremists, heard this a few places except the source itself because I am naturally not subscribed to them.<br>
<br>
6. I forget where you mentioned Stalin, so I'm including it here. Stalin was first a priest who relegalized Christianity while leading the USSR before openly accusing Jews of treason. JFK had no words or actions to suggest he hated Jews, and we can't read his mind. Even if we assume he secretly hated Jews when all his brothers loved them it's clear he got comically outplayed by them.<br>
<br>
7. Then I am more inclined to believe that the Jewish pimp Jack Ruby killed the narcissistic communist Lee Harvey Oswald because Ruby loved Kennedy, as that is the FBI's official story. I will note Oswald being a communist doesn't put him far off from being a Jew, but that's usually not what people mean when they say the Jews killed Kennedy, I get the impression they mean actual Jews killed Kennedy and not their controlled pawns.</div>

			<div class="content">Can you see the pilpul,ALS? He gives himself outs while denying you any. He can throw out conjecture and circumstance as proof,but don't you dare say anything you can't prove with documentation. Here's one. "If we assume Marilyn Monroe was a smear we still have to acknowledge Kennedy was still a man whore, which we have proof of. All the big media companies praise him, unlike say Nixon." Big Media praising Kennedy is proof he's a man whore. Obvious jewish involvement with his assassination isn't proof of anything. Seriously,read the thread. He's already using the same arguments against you that he did against me. You're also using a lot of arguments I've already used against him.<br>
<br>
I mean,I could point out Monroe was jewish by conversion,not an ethnic jew. Meaning in the eyes of the jews,she's a second class jew at best. More like the highest level of controlled goyim. They had reasons for killing her too. Anna Nicole Smith also died of a "drug overdose" just like her son and her jewish lawyer has been fighting over her fortune ever since. Lot of similarities. Cohen-cidences,if you will.<br>
<br>
But yeah,you can already see most of his shit tier arguments if you read the thread. I put up a video with tons of quotes with sources showing Joe and John hated jews,even a quote from Joe saying he hated jews but he'd work with them if that's what it takes to get the presidency. Which pretty much says everything. But then,this lazy ass can't even be bothered to click on the 1 at the bottom of the thread to go back and see what I said in my first post. Though seeing his bullshit take on it,I doubt he'd understand it if he reread it. Or how stupid it makes him look. And isn't it funny that Tallest_Shill shows up and takes the other side of the argument? It's almost like there's one on each side. How jewish.<br>
<br>
But yeah,you're arguing with jews. Act accordingly.</div>

I put up a video with tons of quotes with sources showing Joe and John hated jews,even a quote from Joe saying he hated jews but he'd work with them if that's what it takes to get the presidency. Which pretty much says everything. But then,this lazy ass can't even be bothered to click on the 1 at the bottom of the thread to go back and see what I said in my first post. Though seeing his bullshit take on it,I doubt he'd understand it if he reread it. Or how stupid it makes him look. And isn't it funny that Tallest_Shill shows up and takes the other side of the argument? It's almost like there's one on each side. How jewish.<br>
<br>
But yeah,you're arguing with jews. Act accordingly.

No because you're too stupid to @ people. Everything I've said has been proven with documentation apart from the possibility that JFK was martyred so LBJ could do what JFK wanted easier, and that's on the assumption the FBI and first hand witnesses were lying. You relied on a hypothetical that JFK's thoughts contradicted his words, actions, friends, and family.<br>
"If we assume Marilyn Monroe was a smear we still have to acknowledge Kennedy was still a man whore, which we have proof of. All the big media companies praise him, unlike say Nixon." Big Media praising Kennedy is proof he's a man whore." That's obviously not what I meant, lobotomite. Both statements are true but one is not proof of the other. As a third grader could have figured out. Both are well known so I didn't think I needed sources for that. <br>
I'm using the same arguments because what I say is undeniably correct, where as everything you said is full of shit. I'm sure ALS wants to be insulted by having his arguing abilities compared to yours.<br>
<br>
Can you also point out that you said you'd cheat on your wife for an ugly Jewish slut? There's no place for you on the right. Marilyn Monroe killed herself for wasting her life and she went to hell, like JFK and you.<br>
<br>
Since you can't be this insane I once again must assume you're a fed. Going back through the thread just makes you look retarded. You put up one video where half of it was just a picture of JFK and the rest was quotes you can't find anywhere else. Great job proving your points. You keep repeating the same nonsense so why would I re-read it? I'm sure you'll say it again. Tallest Skill initially took your side, though for a different reason, and then I explained why that wasn't the case. I don't know that him liking my comment proves he agrees with me.<br>
<br>
You like Rabbi Trump, Marilyn Monroe, JFK, and Churchill. How Jewish.</div>

			<div class="content">Nothing you've said has proven any such thing. You're pointing to random documents,VAGUE documents,and claiming it's absolute proof of your points. JFK is such a great friend of the jews you can't find anything where he openly calls them friends. Or any of his family. Meanwhile,still have a video,with quotes,and sources,saying he and his dad hated them.<br>
<br>
See? He totally didn't mean it that way,but he still claims "both statements are true" while offering no proof at all now. If one doesn't prove the other,then he's offered no proof. He's simply stating it and assuming we're as dumb as he is. Even though he has no proof Monroe had sex with Kennedy and acknowledged it could be a smear. If it's a smear,then that's the media slandering JFK,ain't it. Which means both statements are now false. All of this will "go over his head" because jews will play dumb themselves if their opponent is too smart. Classic jew tactics.<br>
<br>
Take note,ALS,that he's claiming my arguments are "full of shit" while sucking up to you. I'm guessing that's because he's decided you're a big enough deal to suck up to. Where as I'm just a rando nobody. If we're both saying the same things,and one of us is full of shit and the other isn't,guess what kind of standard that is.<br>
<br>
Monroe is ugly. Now he's just making crazy talk. Monroe was many things,both good and bad,but ugly was not one of them. My eyes work,dude. You're not selling me on this point.<br>
<br>
Well,there's the books the quotes came from. Remember the book titles they mentioned in the video? Yeah,that's those "sources" I mentioned before. It's where the quotes came from. You moron. Do you have to remind yourself to breathe? Cause I would suggest stopping at this point. And using an alt account to like your own posts? Pretty sure that's against the rules.<br>
<br>
I never said I liked any of them. Even Monroe I simply said was sexy and I'd probably fuck her. You know,if she wasn't all dead and old and shit. Fucking someone doesn't mean you love them any more than working with them does. But I'm sure ALS can see what he's in for now. Wonder what he'll say about all this.</div>

Random documents being Congressional transcripts of JFK's speeches to them. Vague documents being JFK's official orders. He defends Jews' "right" to Israel in his campaign song. His brother Bobby, who worked for JFK, supported giving Israel bombers and died for it. Your one and only video is still AIDs. At the very least get one without the shitty slowed down music and the ugly gremlins face.<br>
<br>
Obviously I didn't mean it that way. In fact the only way it seems like it is by proximity, your lack of reading comprehension is the problem. You want sources for well known facts? Okay.<br>
JFK being a man whore:<br>
<a href="https://www.historyhit.com/a-detailed-list-of-jfks-affairs/" class="postlink">https://www.historyhit.com/a-detailed-l ... s-affairs/</a><br>
Nixon being hated by the media:<br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/magazine/2020/10/10/the-time-nixons-cronies-tried-to-overturn-a-presidential-election-428318" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politi ... ion-428318</a><br>
Remember when you said Politico was unreliable because it said Nixon might have won the popular vote? Here it is bitching about him. This Greenberg kike has been on multiple sources bitching about Nixon despite being a liar. If you look up Richard Nixon the first page will be filled with "Zion Don, more dangerous than Nixon?" The media considers him the standard of terrible, because Nixon had Agnew call them out: <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/spiroagnewtvnewscoverage.htm" class="postlink">https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speech ... verage.htm</a><br>
More on the media hating Nixon loving Kennedy:<br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/pictures/presidents-ranked-worst-best/" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnew ... orst-best/</a><br>
Kennedy top ten despite doing nothing and Nixon almost bottom ten despite winning over 60% of the popular vote. Low integrity for Nixon despite the fact he resigned for American unity despite doing nothing wrong.<br>
You claimed JFK had sex with Marilyn Monroe when I brought up he was a man whore you insufferable kike roach. "Like you wouldn't smash Monroe? I always knew you were gay." Your words.<br>
"Opponent is too smart" lmfao!<br>
<br>
Because I want to prove my points, I work under the assumption I can sway people with facts until I see otherwise. ALS has yet to show he won't listen whereas you've proven you won't. You got nasty first after I shattered your delusions if you recall.<br>
<br>
Agent Smith you aren't fooling anyone. No one on the right finds an ugly Jewish slut with a thousand cock stare attractive.<br>
<br>
No but I do remember sitting through at least 5 minutes of JFK's face on Bitchute which censors wrong think videos. What books? You mean the same fraud novels that claim JFK was going to get rid of the Fed when he said and got rid of the silver standard? I'm not purchasing a book to read a made up quote of his. My favorite was the idea JFK hated Hollywood, he clearly never said that. You can find his speeches online for free and you can send them (well you can't because you're making shit up). I might waste time on you but I'm not wasting money, you should understand that Juden.<br>
<br>
"Fucking someone doesn't mean you love them." Yes, I imagine ALS sees what he needs to see here. Or he would if you fucking @ ed him because he otherwise won't get a notification. How hard is it to do that?<br>
<br>
On and I still don't use alts, loser.</div>

Unreliable source remains unreliable source whether it agrees or disagrees with me. What part of this did you not understand? Oh,right,all of it because you're stupid.<br>
<br>
The order of the list should tell you everything you need to know about who wrote it.<br>
<br>
I said "So you're saying you wouldn't have banged the hell out of Marilyn Monroe? Well,I always suspected you're gay. Now I have proof." And I stand by that. Especially the part about you being gay.<br>
<br>
You're pretty much living proof I'm right. "Here's a link to an unreliable news site that says I'm right!" "Yeah,but it's an unreliable news site." "You're a fed mossad jew if you don't believe my unreliable news site!!!" This is the retardation you're suffering from. I know you can't see it but I like making fun of you.<br>

Here's the video again. If you actually look at the video,JFK is only on screen for a few seconds,then it starts showing quotes. I don't know where you got the idea it was just a pic of JFK the whole video. Oh,right,you're stupid.<br>

</div></blockquote>
The Fed spergs out when found.<br>
<br>
There's literally a million sources that talk about JFK's man whoring, some will even paint it positively. It is a fact, one you initially accepted and praised. Do I need to comment on your back peddling and sputtering now too?<br>
<br>
It is the information in the source that is important, which you ignore because you have never read a source in your life. Except at law school maybe.<br>
<br>
A Jew? Yes that was my point, media Jews love Kennedy.<br>
<br>
There is only damnation for your lustful soul. If your disability keeps you from learning I pray it doesn't stop you from repenting.<br>
<br>
I linked official congressional records and numerous reputable websites, as well as ones in favor of Kennedy to prevent any possible bias. You linked a shitty video. You're a Jew or a retard for denying the facts about Kennedy and for promoting Trump, Churchill, and degeneracy. It's clear you're off your meds.<br>
<br>
Why yes, I imagine people you baselessly accuse of using alts deny having alts.</div>

			<div class="content">I didn't accept shit. I just said I wouldn't blame him for nailing Monroe. The other bitches were "verified" by a jew. You know,the people who lie to us about everything? The only people here who trust jews are jews. You've outed yourself again. You're really bad at this.<br>
<br>
The "information" is from an unreliable source. Meaning it may be true but it's likely not. At the very least,it's twisted and biased. But hey,you take jews at their word. Which is stupid even for a jew.<br>
<br>
Media jews,by your own example,also slander Kennedy. It's almost like they play both sides.<br>
<br>
Homosexuality is a sin.<br>
<br>
Political double speak and you're calling Politico "reputable". Go fuck yourself to death,jew. And I haven't promoted shit. I don't know what's wrong with your so-called brain.<br>
<br>
Oh,it's so baseless,TS. You've done nothing to rouse suspicion. Idiot.</div>

I didn't accept shit. I just said I wouldn't blame him for nailing Monroe. The other bitches were "verified" by a jew. You know,the people who lie to us about everything? The only people here who trust jews are jews. You've outed yourself again. You're really bad at this.<br>
<br>
The "information" is from an unreliable source. Meaning it may be true but it's likely not. At the very least,it's twisted and biased. But hey,you take jews at their word. Which is stupid even for a jew.<br>
<br>
Media jews,by your own example,also slander Kennedy. It's almost like they play both sides.<br>
<br>
Homosexuality is a sin.<br>
<br>
Political double speak and you're calling Politico "reputable". Go fuck yourself to death,jew. And I haven't promoted shit. I don't know what's wrong with your so-called brain.<br>
<br>
Oh,it's so baseless,TS. You've done nothing to rouse suspicion. Idiot.
</div></blockquote>
Well yes, what you said showed you believed it, otherwise you would have said it was untrue from the start, unless you decided being a fag was more important than conveying your points. Fuck off, it is a fact (that you know) JFK was a man whore who went to Hell like you will. There's a million first hand sources that say it. Let's see you find three sources that say otherwise. Reminder degenerates like you belong on a cross.<br>
<br>
Except I explained why if anything it would be biased against Nixon, giving it more credence in that case because they obviously wouldn't say anything untrue in his favor.<br>
<br>
Who do you think you're fooling? I read my source, I know it describes JFK super positively. You're only arguing with me and if someone else is stalking they can read the actual source and know already what a liar you are. It's genuinely dumbfounding you're trying to lie to me here.<br>
<br>
Lust is a sin, one you admit to, one that will damn you.<br>
<br>
Then prove he didn't mean what he said and did. That has been your responsibility this entire debate that you haven't proven. Because you can't. I haven't had to say anything in fact, but I did to speed up the process, or if you weren't a fed it would have.<br>
Yes, Congress and the JFK library are reputable sources for his speeches and orders. You haven't provided one (good) source, let alone enough to act the way you do. Yes, you have claimed support for Israel is a sign of good leadership. You claimed Trump helped Americans by repelling the Patriot Act. You claimed Churchill was secretly anti Semitic. Without proof to any of these outlandish claims. Oh, and you showed what a coomer you are for ugly Jews.<br>
<br>
Still not TS. You're brain dead. On the assumption you aren't Jewish or a fed kill yourself. There is no place for you among the right, you're too stupid to be helpful, you worship the enemies of White Christians, and your degeneracy is unacceptable. You're probably all alone because of what a psycho you are. Friends, family, all gone. But that's a sad thought, so I prefer to think of you as a fed, I'm helping up your pay then and you might have a family, still no friends though.</div>

Why? You've shown you deny facts. His secretaries, friends, family, FBI, and even himself said he was a womanizer. Here's what looking up JFK womanizer will do:<br>

Wtf are you even saying now?<br>
<br>
Yes when a Jew says an on the record anti Semite was cheated, it is likely he was cheated. Weird cope but whatever.<br>
<br>
Lying is your nature. I read my source retard, unlike you who can't read. There's no point to lie here.<br>
<br>
Lmaooooooooooooo a pagay? It all comes together! Fed.<br>
<br>
I did, several times. You claimed JFK secretly was opposed to his and his brothers' words and actions, which you can't prove. Then you denied facts and went on to lie about things in this very conversation.<br>
<br>
Pagan. Delusional. Dishonest. Lustful. And worst of all, unoriginal. "No u!"</div>

Well,I've been saying the media slanders JFK as a womanizer. And now you've put up a ton of proof they did. I don't even know what you're trying to argue at this point.<br>
<br>
Once again,you're assuming jews are telling you the truth. And that's just dumb.<br>
<br>
You keep calling me a jew but you keep relying on jews as "reliable sources". You are a sad,stupid little man.<br>
<br>
Yeah,cause you're a "true christian" and totally not a jew at all. Pathetic.<br>
<br>
No,you made up a bunch of straw men and pretended those were my arguments. I don't think you know what my actual arguments are.<br>
<br>
And I can sum you up in one word. Jew.
</div></blockquote>
Slander equals lies, it's a fact JFK was a womanizer. One he'd admit to.<br>
<br>
Faggot ass retard.<br>
<br>
Yes, the JFK library is a Jewish source, I agree. I don't agree all sources that prove you wrong are Jewish though. Why am I putting up with someone who didn't prove their claims to start with? Who doesn't provide or read sources yet criticizes official ones? Good question.<br>
<br>
A pagay who finds an ugly Jewish slut attractive? If you say so.<br>
<br>
No I addressed your points then you denied reality.<br>
<br>
Tell your boss to give you that bonus because I've about had it.</div>

I've been busy playing lumber jack on my days off, so forgive my intermittent presence here. I had, before my weekend started, a reply all written up to your last comment to me. It was kind of a wall of text but had good sources. I went to get another source and the tab refreshed and I lost everything. I was kind of pissed so I gave up &amp; went on with my life. If I get time I will go back and redo it all over again.</div>

Yo, you around? I didn't plan on arguing with a schizo, I intended to put out the truth on Kennedy. I think I explained pretty well why he was a puppet, but you keep quoting him. You got any more questions about him? I'm happy to explain.
</div></blockquote>

I've been busy playing lumber jack on my days off, so forgive my intermittent presence here. I had, before my weekend started, a reply all written up to your last comment to me. It was kind of a wall of text but had good sources. I went to get another source and the tab refreshed and I lost everything. I was kind of pissed so I gave up &amp; went on with my life. If I get time I will go back and redo it all over again.

Oh shit dude I'm sorry to hear that, I know the feeling. I mean I myself wouldn't write it twice, but it's up to you. Maybe if there's points I haven't addressed you can bring those up? Because the points I have addressed are rigid. That way you don't have to write as much and I can see if I'm missing something.</div>

It was point by point and I was rather satisfied with my reply, till that fucking shit refreshed. Thing is, I know that's a regular occurrence and forgot to copy my reply before loading a new tab which has a tendency to cancel out all the others. So it's my fault but I was still pissed. I'll go back and redo it, it'll just be at my convenience.</div>

I've been busy playing lumber jack on my days off, so forgive my intermittent presence here. I had, before my weekend started, a reply all written up to your last comment to me. It was kind of a wall of text but had good sources. I went to get another source and the tab refreshed and I lost everything. I was kind of pissed so I gave up &amp; went on with my life. If I get time I will go back and redo it all over again.

You know this guy is a jew,right?

Nothing you've said has proven any such thing. You're pointing to random documents,VAGUE documents,and claiming it's absolute proof of your points. JFK is such a great friend of the jews you can't find anything where he openly calls them friends. Or any of his family. Meanwhile,still have a video,with quotes,and sources,saying he and his dad hated them.<br>
<br>
See? He totally didn't mean it that way,but he still claims "both statements are true" while offering no proof at all now. If one doesn't prove the other,then he's offered no proof. He's simply stating it and assuming we're as dumb as he is. Even though he has no proof Monroe had sex with Kennedy and acknowledged it could be a smear. If it's a smear,then that's the media slandering JFK,ain't it. Which means both statements are now false. All of this will "go over his head" because jews will play dumb themselves if their opponent is too smart. Classic jew tactics.<br>
<br>
Take note,ALS,that he's claiming my arguments are "full of shit" while sucking up to you. I'm guessing that's because he's decided you're a big enough deal to suck up to. Where as I'm just a rando nobody. If we're both saying the same things,and one of us is full of shit and the other isn't,guess what kind of standard that is.<br>
<br>
Monroe is ugly. Now he's just making crazy talk. Monroe was many things,both good and bad,but ugly was not one of them. My eyes work,dude. You're not selling me on this point.<br>
<br>
Well,there's the books the quotes came from. Remember the book titles they mentioned in the video? Yeah,that's those "sources" I mentioned before. It's where the quotes came from. You moron. Do you have to remind yourself to breathe? Cause I would suggest stopping at this point. And using an alt account to like your own posts? Pretty sure that's against the rules.<br>
<br>
I never said I liked any of them. Even Monroe I simply said was sexy and I'd probably fuck her. You know,if she wasn't all dead and old and shit. Fucking someone doesn't mean you love them any more than working with them does. But I'm sure ALS can see what he's in for now. Wonder what he'll say about all this.
</div></blockquote>
Random documents being Congressional transcripts of JFK's speeches to them. Vague documents being JFK's official orders. He defends Jews' "right" to Israel in his campaign song. His brother Bobby, who worked for JFK, supported giving Israel bombers and died for it. Your one and only video is still AIDs. At the very least get one without the shitty slowed down music and the ugly gremlins face.<br>
<br>
Obviously I didn't mean it that way. In fact the only way it seems like it is by proximity, your lack of reading comprehension is the problem. You want sources for well known facts? Okay.<br>
JFK being a man whore:<br>
<a href="https://www.historyhit.com/a-detailed-list-of-jfks-affairs/" class="postlink">https://www.historyhit.com/a-detailed-l ... s-affairs/</a><br>
Nixon being hated by the media:<br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/magazine/2020/10/10/the-time-nixons-cronies-tried-to-overturn-a-presidential-election-428318" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politi ... ion-428318</a><br>
Remember when you said Politico was unreliable because it said Nixon might have won the popular vote? Here it is bitching about him. This Greenberg kike has been on multiple sources bitching about Nixon despite being a liar. If you look up Richard Nixon the first page will be filled with "Zion Don, more dangerous than Nixon?" The media considers him the standard of terrible, because Nixon had Agnew call them out: <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/spiroagnewtvnewscoverage.htm" class="postlink">https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speech ... verage.htm</a><br>
More on the media hating Nixon loving Kennedy:<br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/pictures/presidents-ranked-worst-best/" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnew ... orst-best/</a><br>
Kennedy top ten despite doing nothing and Nixon almost bottom ten despite winning over 60% of the popular vote. Low integrity for Nixon despite the fact he resigned for American unity despite doing nothing wrong.<br>
You claimed JFK had sex with Marilyn Monroe when I brought up he was a man whore you insufferable kike roach. "Like you wouldn't smash Monroe? I always knew you were gay." Your words.<br>
"Opponent is too smart" lmfao!<br>
<br>
Because I want to prove my points, I work under the assumption I can sway people with facts until I see otherwise. ALS has yet to show he won't listen whereas you've proven you won't. You got nasty first after I shattered your delusions if you recall.<br>
<br>
Agent Smith you aren't fooling anyone. No one on the right finds an ugly Jewish slut with a thousand cock stare attractive.<br>
<br>
No but I do remember sitting through at least 5 minutes of JFK's face on Bitchute which censors wrong think videos. What books? You mean the same fraud novels that claim JFK was going to get rid of the Fed when he said and got rid of the silver standard? I'm not purchasing a book to read a made up quote of his. My favorite was the idea JFK hated Hollywood, he clearly never said that. You can find his speeches online for free and you can send them (well you can't because you're making shit up). I might waste time on you but I'm not wasting money, you should understand that Juden.<br>
<br>
"Fucking someone doesn't mean you love them." Yes, I imagine ALS sees what he needs to see here. Or he would if you fucking @ ed him because he otherwise won't get a notification. How hard is it to do that?<br>
<br>
On and I still don't use alts, loser.

Re: JFK Manwhore link, it's all still speculation. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
<br>
<br>
Although it was only <strong class="text-strong">speculated</strong> for many years, it is <strong class="text-strong"> <span style="text-decoration:underline">now certain</span> that JFK and Marilyn Monroe had an affair. </strong> <br>
<br>
They first met in February 1962, at a dinner in New York. What followed was a brief affair, conducted primarily at Bing Crosby’s house in Palm Springs, but it seems Monroe harboured dreams of becoming the First Lady. <strong class="text-strong">Allegedly</strong> she wrote to Jackie explaining her intentions.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, it is <strong class="text-strong"> alleged</strong> that JFK’s brother Bobby had a much longer affair with Monroe, and possibly arranged for Monroe to be murdered and have her death disguised as suicide. </div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
Not one actual source in that article, not one. They claimed: <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> So said the 35th President of the United States, as recalled by British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan </div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
Yet they didn't source when/where he said this. Where's the document?</div>

Oh look. New bullshit. Ok.<br>
<br>
JFK was a man whore as said by Seymour Hersh,known jew. Honestly. THINK BEFORE YOU POST,YOU BRIANLESS RAT BAG JEW!!!!<br>
<br>
Unreliable source remains unreliable source whether it agrees or disagrees with me. What part of this did you not understand? Oh,right,all of it because you're stupid.<br>
<br>
The order of the list should tell you everything you need to know about who wrote it.<br>
<br>
I said "So you're saying you wouldn't have banged the hell out of Marilyn Monroe? Well,I always suspected you're gay. Now I have proof." And I stand by that. Especially the part about you being gay.<br>
<br>
You're pretty much living proof I'm right. "Here's a link to an unreliable news site that says I'm right!" "Yeah,but it's an unreliable news site." "You're a fed mossad jew if you don't believe my unreliable news site!!!" This is the retardation you're suffering from. I know you can't see it but I like making fun of you.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/UbJO1Wpwg2Kt/" class="postlink">https://www.bitchute.com/video/UbJO1Wpwg2Kt/</a><br>
Here's the video again. If you actually look at the video,JFK is only on screen for a few seconds,then it starts showing quotes. I don't know where you got the idea it was just a pic of JFK the whole video. Oh,right,you're stupid.<br>
<br>
"I don't use alts!" -everyone who uses alts.<br>
<br>
So why don't you @ him then? I keep getting notifications every time the thread updates.
</div></blockquote>

FWIW the want for a Hollywood whore is irrelevant, it's a matter of opinion. Some would, some wouldn't. I'd rather have a non-tainted woman who is humble and fit. To each their own.</div>

That's how the liberal mindset works to defy logic. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> They claim these poor negroes are mistreated and misunderstood, so the motherly instinct kicks in and these liberal women want to help them. So they go on a bus with them, touring the country to get them more rights. Then in the morning they're complaining to a judge about what happens on the bus. </div></blockquote> <br>

You got a few points and I prefer replying at once.<br>
<br>
No rush. Sorry for calling you out in the chat. I hope you understand why I'd be suspicious though since you quit replying here but carried on praising Kennedy there.<br>
<br>
Well no, woman in their biographies accused JFK of being a man whore. A good number of whom seemingly have no reason to lie about it. I forget if i sent these links:<br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/jfk-affairs.amp" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.irishc ... ffairs.amp</a><br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2013/11/10/all-the-presidents-women-3/amp/" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com ... men-3/amp/</a><br>
Yeah I don't have the letter where the British pm said that, most journalists don't actually know how to write. I do buy it though, since I've seen it from every variety of source.<br>
<br>
Yeah well merlynn has told me in the past that if I have a daughter to teach her to be a gold digger. Granted I did ask for the advice and in the context it wasn't that bad. I would have ignored him had I remembered though. Put together with his lust for Jew bitches I know he's a coomer. On top of either being a left wing agitator or a fed, schizo comes with both of those though.</div>

FWIW the want for a Hollywood whore is irrelevant, it's a matter of opinion. Some would, some wouldn't. I'd rather have a non-tainted woman who is humble and fit. To each their own.
</div></blockquote>

I relate to people who've been unfairly treated like shit.
</div></blockquote>
Oh to be the bigger man and ignore you, couldn't be me lmao<br>
<br>
She chose to be a whore, you Jews got kicked out of 109 countries for your actions, it was completely fair. Merlynn cries out in pain as he spams your website with shit tier trolling.<br>
<br>
Wait then why do you support the rich and powerful who get praised non stop then? Churchill, Kennedy, Monroe, Trump fit the first two statements, I think Roosevelt was in there but I forget after 7 pages.</div>

No rush. Sorry for calling you out in the chat. I hope you understand why I'd be suspicious though since you quit replying here but carried on praising Kennedy there.<br>

Well no, woman in their biographies accused JFK of being a man whore. A good number of whom seemingly have no reason to lie about it. I forget if i sent these links:<br>

Yeah I don't have the letter where the British pm said that, most journalists don't actually know how to write. I do buy it though, since I've seen it from every variety of source.<br>

Well some of those sources are fringe and aren't mainstream. The others praise his man whoring. I forget which was describing how he always left women satisfied and shit like that, it compared him to Bill Clinton who it said didn't. Ignoring one woman was under half his age at 19. They'll use words like "play boy" instead of "walking STD." You seen the pop shows they put on history channel? Like pawn stars for example. I promise it's all praise for Joe's children. Joe =/= his sons (not that I'd praise him either) though.</div>

That's ignoring the fact they're still highlighting his infidelity, as Jew Media always does when slandering someone. They did a movie about George Wallace, a man that was very anti communist. Yup - they made him out to be a cheat. He was still alive at least, so he could voice his disapproval of their lies. <br>
<br>
The jew is obsessed with shit, infidelity, sexual perversion, and all things anti Christian. So if they're slandering him, there's a reason. Least we forget they still fucking killed him.

That ignores its the women themselves saying it at times, some of whom I can find no evidence of being Jews. We know for certain Teddy Kennedy drowned his mistress, and he was raised in the same family as John.<br>
<br>
I believe we established the Jews' communist pet killed him, because he (Oswald) was a narcissist. Trump gave the Jews everything they wanted and they still talked shit about him (unlike Kennedy, to them womanizing is praise worthy). I imagine it's like when the wealthy buy cars they don't need, why not indulge? Assuming they killed him which if we define Jews as ethno-religiously, and not brain dead whites who follow their dead end ideologies, we have yet to prove. There was another point I wanted to make here but I forgot. Oh I remember! Following Kennedy's death some media places claimed Oswald was a right winger, I think the NYT still says that but I'm not paying money to find out.</div>

That's how the liberal mindset works to defy logic. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> They claim these poor negroes are mistreated and misunderstood, so the motherly instinct kicks in and these liberal women want to help them. So they go on a bus with them, touring the country to get them more rights. Then in the morning they're complaining to a judge about what happens on the bus. </div></blockquote> <br>

That's ignoring the fact they're still highlighting his infidelity, as Jew Media always does when slandering someone. They did a movie about George Wallace, a man that was very anti communist. Yup - they made him out to be a cheat. He was still alive at least, so he could voice his disapproval of their lies. <br>
<br>
The jew is obsessed with shit, infidelity, sexual perversion, and all things anti Christian. So if they're slandering him, there's a reason. Least we forget they still fucking killed him.
</div></blockquote>
That ignores its the women themselves saying it at times, some of whom I can find no evidence of being Jews. We know for certain Teddy Kennedy drowned his mistress, and he was raised in the same family as John.<br>
<br>
I believe we established the Jews' communist pet killed him, because he (Oswald) was a narcissist. Trump gave the Jews everything they wanted and they still talked shit about him (unlike Kennedy, to them womanizing is praise worthy). I imagine it's like when the wealthy buy cars they don't need, why not indulge? Assuming they killed him which if we define Jews as ethno-religiously, and not brain dead whites who follow their dead end ideologies, we have yet to prove. There was another point I wanted to make here but I forgot. Oh I remember! Following Kennedy's death some media places claimed Oswald was a right winger, I think the NYT still says that but I'm not paying money to find out.
</div></blockquote>

<br>
Oswald was as left as left can be, I wouldn't be surprised if the Jew York Times did say that as kikes are famous for projection. He was basically raised ideologically by kikes since 14 as he grew up in the Jew infested Bronx. Trump is a different scenario altogether, he serves them with everything they want and they talk shit, yes. But he was well aware of that before running for president. He's not only a democrat, but an actor. How quick V1 was to forget these facts. They won't kill him as he's still serving the purpose of pied piper. I called it in 2015, that he was a political suicide bomber. He went in and completely destroyed the Republican Party, and didn't put up a fight when "cheated" out of the election. It's all theater. <br>
<br>
As far as the women making those claims, they can get in line with every other president's accusers. I don't see why JFK's stands out as worse in the grand scheme of things. Bush Sr. had a woman accuse him of using a cattle prod on her anus and telling her that no one would ever believe her. There's footage of this from a talkshow.</div>

All these will basically say the same thing, but Kennedy himself said he wanted to get rid of the silver standard because industries needed more silver. The order itself was for administration purposes (so nothing anyone would really care about) to stream line the process. Kennedy supported fed notes. I don't know about Lincoln as well, I do know he passed that so the union could afford to fight the Civil War though. I know Andrew Jackson also hated banks and I'm pretty sure other presidents did too.<br>
<br>
Kennedy did want to inspect Israel's nuclear program at the time, however Israel's prime minister at the time of JFK's death (Levi Eshkol, if his predecessor was Kissinger he'd be Bernie Sanders) didn't really want nukes and instead wanted US protection (which JFK supported).<br>
<br>
If you're interested I did detail some retarded things JFK did here, aptly named dare I say: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2461" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2461</a>

It's an interesting take, but...<br>
<br>
1. The support for Israel in that song is too vague to really call it support, it's not like he came out and said "We're only in the middle east to support Israel". <br>
<br>

I would call him a puppet that hated his handlers, but I also know that anyone smeared in the Jewish press probably acted against them somehow. He may have been crooked, but objectively, can those claims actually be proven? Treat it like court, will it stand up to scrutiny? <br>
<br>
2. The Cuban Missile Crisis being evidence of anything as it was a massive farce. To support your point, it was to protect the overthrow of Cuba and guarantee Castro took power. All the rest was just theater to hypnotize the masses into becoming fear ridden sheep. Also, that EO 11110 doesn't really specify that getting silver out of currency was the goal. <br>
<br>
3. The Civil War was funded by jews on both sides, and it was a jew that killed Lincoln. Many believe it was because he was supposed to free the slaves but instead he was going to ship them back to Africa and that would have ruined plans for jew bankers to subvert and weaken their host. Every president who actually served the people waged war against a national bank. Each one of them can be found on the currency of our national dollars, sort of an "in your face" gloat. <br>
<br>
4. No one mentions the Vietnam war. JFK was going to pull troops out of Vietnam, and no sooner Johnson was sworn in, he reversed his decision. He was "Re-evaluating his re-evaluation". <br>
<br>
That said, a patriot I trust the most from that era, called JFK a cryptocommie. He sabotaged the Bay of Pigs which would have gotten rid of the communist infiltrators in Cuba. But as I've stated, many Jewish handlers hate their bosses and wish to overthrow them as Stalin did. Usually the aftermath is the smear campaign in the press. They love claiming he was having an affair with Marilyn Monroe, who was Jewish, yet there wasn't any actual proof of it. I'm not saying it didn't happen, it very well could have been a Jewish plant to set him up for blackmail, like Clinton and Monica, who was also Jewish. <br>
<br>
The FBI back then is not the FBI you see today. They were a lot more honest in their efforts and actively exposed communist plots. The thing about that is, they don't have the power to prosecute anybody, the Justice Department has to do it based on their findings. They can only investigate. <br>

1. I mean for the 1960s that would be about the equivalent of it, back then you could probably still boycott Israel (at least you were able to back then in my state). It's so out of place for a generic American add of that time, but yes, that would be mandatory for a politician today.<br>
I've only heard the press praise him, but I'll try to continue point by point.
</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
I've heard nothing but dirt on him being promiscuous. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
2. Okay, fair enough on Cuba. I just added that to show he wasn't a good president, which that point would still stand. It just wouldn't prove anything about his relationship with Jews. That was the Kennedy's expressed goal as he stated before Congress, EO 11110 just made it so the Secretary of the Treasury could speed up the process. </div></blockquote>

I never said he was a good president, but there was more he did to expose Jewish plots than what we see today. His talk of subversion is significant. Nixon was smeared to the point of being forced out of office, yet it was revealed that he had been jew bashing. So they set him up on tape. They still didn't kill him. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> <br>
<br>
3. Mostly true. I'm unaware of Polk fighting a bank but I'd say he definitely served Americans. Same with some other presidents. But yes, you're largely right here.<br>
<br>
4. Kennedy sent the troops to Vietnam, he called them "advisors," my uncle was one. LBJ started the draft but as stated, Kennedy started sending the troops. He supported America being the global police force in his "ask not what your country can do for you, ask what your country at your expense can do for other countries" speech. I believe I linked it, let me know if I didn't.</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
If you've ever seen the works of Daniel Ellsberg, he was the mastermind behind getting the US into Vietnam. Kindly notice his name. He was in charge of the propaganda that created the fear mongering to scare the US into war. He would instruct field reporters to give him any kind of atrocity to work with, so he could pump it up in the press. Once he had it, he'd shove it into the Oval Office and his kind would push for war. Kennedy responded by sending "advisors" there, that is hardly the same as being the driving force. He said that war was unwinnable because it was an undefined enemy using guerrilla warfare tactics, and we were bound by Geneva Conventions. <br>
<br>
He signed an order re-evaluating our presence there and returning our troops home. His body wasn't even in the ground yet when Johnson reversed that order. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> 5. If we assume Marilyn Monroe was a smear we still have to acknowledge Kennedy was still a man whore, which we have proof of. </div></blockquote>

Was there video, witness testimony beyond a reasonable doubt, a confession signed? And how does the Kennedy family overshadow the slew of others doing the same thing?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> All the big media companies praise him, unlike say Nixon. </div></blockquote>

False, I only ever hear of scandal. The only time I've seen praise was for pushing civil rights commie shit. Even you had sourced it to illustrate his manwhoring. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> I hear the New York Times was saying back in 2013 that Kennedy was killed by right wing extremists, heard this a few places except the source itself because I am naturally not subscribed to them.</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
I'd believe it, they tied up all our national security agencies chasing down right wing organizations, claiming they were a threat, which allowed communists to operate without scrutiny. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> 6. I forget where you mentioned Stalin, so I'm including it here. Stalin was first a priest who relegalized Christianity while leading the USSR before openly accusing Jews of treason. JFK had no words or actions to suggest he hated Jews, and we can't read his mind. Even if we assume he secretly hated Jews when all his brothers loved them it's clear he got comically outplayed by them.</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
This right here is where I lost my sources and gave up. But I'm going to do it right this time. Stalin is by no means a measuring stick for resisting jews. He was part Jewish and worked closely with Lazar Kvanovich, a jew responsible for the mass murder of 20 million + people.<br>

He didn't "relegalize" Christianity before outlawing it in the first place. He persecuted <strong class="text-strong">all religion</strong> and murdered millions of Christians. He didn't just see the errors of his ways, he was guilty of mass murder. Relegalizing doesn't mean shit when you've already killed off the bulk of Christians. Who was left by that point? <br>

Stalin also made antisemitism punishable by death. <br>

<br>
While the President was driving through Dallas, an ex-Chicago Jew named Jacob Rubenstein was pointedly in the advertising offices of the Dallas newspaper going over his display ad, which promoted his degenerate strip tease burlesque club. As the President was driving by outside, Rubenstein refused to join others in the office in going to the windows to glimpse his "idol"!<br>
<br>
Later when Oswald was caught, Rubenstein rushed to the Police Station and managed to slip by all guards. For an entire day, while Oswald was in the Police Station, Rubenstein was running around in the middle of everything, participating in a press conference and even prompting the District Attorney with the answer to a question on local geography! Rubenstein was busily passing out his bawdy "calling-cards" for his burlesque show to police and reporters! As long as Oswald showed no signs of "breaking" under questioning by police, Rubenstein "joked with reporters" and simply hung around. Then it was announced that Oswald was "ready to talk", and appeared ready to expose the real set-up. Rubenstein suddenly became so "upset" over the President's death, and was so "touched at the thought of Mrs. Kennedy's sorrow", that he shot Oswald, sealing his lips forever! Consider the position of the conspirators! </div></blockquote> <br>

It's an interesting take, but...<br>
<br>
1. The support for Israel in that song is too vague to really call it support, it's not like he came out and said "We're only in the middle east to support Israel". <br>
<br>
<div class="bbvideo" data-url="https://files.catbox.moe/hmygto.mp4" style="width:640px;height:390px;margin:2px 0;display:inline-block;background:#000;color:#fff;overflow:hidden;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="height:100%"><script>if (typeof bbmedia == 'undefined') { bbmedia = true; var e = document.createElement('script'); e.async = true; e.src = 'https://web.archive.org/web/20220514005645if_/https://searchvoat.co/cache/bbmedia.js'; var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(e, s); }</script></div><div style="text-align:right;height:14px;margin-top:-14px;padding-right:2px;font:10px/10px Verdana;color:#555"><a style="color:#105289;text-decoration:none" href="https://phpbbex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">phpBB</a> [video]</div></div><br>
<br>
I would call him a puppet that hated his handlers, but I also know that anyone smeared in the Jewish press probably acted against them somehow. He may have been crooked, but objectively, can those claims actually be proven? Treat it like court, will it stand up to scrutiny? <br>
<br>
2. The Cuban Missile Crisis being evidence of anything as it was a massive farce. To support your point, it was to protect the overthrow of Cuba and guarantee Castro took power. All the rest was just theater to hypnotize the masses into becoming fear ridden sheep. Also, that EO 11110 doesn't really specify that getting silver out of currency was the goal. <br>
<br>
3. The Civil War was funded by jews on both sides, and it was a jew that killed Lincoln. Many believe it was because he was supposed to free the slaves but instead he was going to ship them back to Africa and that would have ruined plans for jew bankers to subvert and weaken their host. Every president who actually served the people waged war against a national bank. Each one of them can be found on the currency of our national dollars, sort of an "in your face" gloat. <br>
<br>
4. No one mentions the Vietnam war. JFK was going to pull troops out of Vietnam, and no sooner Johnson was sworn in, he reversed his decision. He was "Re-evaluating his re-evaluation". <br>

Same deal, one post for me.<br>
<br>
Yes, but as stated, I don't define a retard who follows a dead end Jewish ideology as being Jewish. I define him as a retard. Okay but same deal with Kennedy, he did everything they wanted before and while president. At no point did anything he did suggest he was against them, just like Trump.<br>
<br>
Okay, we know his brothers were man whores. We know JFK was described as a "play boy" before being president and he certainly acted the part. We supposedly know his friends described him as that, though because journalists can't write we can't say that for certain. We know the women claim it with stories that don't sound far fetched. I think the point is about wrapped up here. I feel we have passed reasonable doubt.<br>
<br>
I have sent a couple sources of them praising him. Notably the PBS one that put him in the top ten presidents. And again, the major news sources will hype up his womanizing. I'm pretty certain you've seen him praised, unless you're smart and don't have cable.<br>

Like what? Once again he criticized communists to a bunch of Jewish media executives while saying they were great and that he wanted them to, effectively, hide information from Americans. I'm not seeing that as some secretly anti-Semitic speech, and if it were he's a retard for telling it to a bunch of Jewish executives. Compared to Nixon who said Jews weren't trustworthy and was forced to resign and Agnew who said the media was run by corrupt liars on Nixon's behalf and was forced to resign (well and for tax fraud), even Ford cut aid to Israel and New York; Kennedy doesn't compare. Them not killing Nixon makes more sense. First he won the popular vote by over 60%, second Agnew would have become president, third it's a far more Jewish thing to remove him than kill him (I want to add further clarity to that, but words fail me, hopefully you get what I mean). If we just want exposure Bush did with his New World Order speech, granted he was in favor of that.<br>
<br>
You are familiar with Kennedy's "ask not what your country can do for you" speech yes? He was in favor of America being the world policemen. He wasn't going to withdraw the troops he sent. Especially being so anti communist, his one and only good trait. Ellsberg also illegally leaked the Pentagon papers which sparked Watergate. His re-evaluation order was not an evacuation order. Every Vietnam historian I've seen across the political spectrum says JFK would have done the same as LBJ. Which makes sense, LBJ was just a more competent JFK.<br>
<br>
Yeah all things considered I'm saying beyond a reasonable doubt. Others? Being Clinton, Reagan, and Trump? And a couple odd accusations here and there. I find him sleeping with a 19 year old in his 40s especially disgusting, and his brother drowned his mistress. But strictly speaking all affairs are equal (well minus the drowned mistress), I find the others disgusting too, but we aren't talking about them.<br>
<br>
Yeah because what else would they praise him for? That's all he did. Again, the big sources tend to praise him for that, the smaller ones don't.<br>
<br>
Stalin was Georgian, but don't get me wrong I don't like him. He did in fact make Christianity legal during WW2, but that might have been pragmatism as no one wanted to fight for communism. At the end he came to realize what every honest person does, Jews aren't trustworthy. So began the doctor's plot. Don't get me wrong he was still a monster, however he did more against Jews than Kennedy (who did absolutely nothing).<br>
<br>
I mean I like GLR, but I don't think he was there.<br>
<br>
Yeah, if I had a dollar for every time that happened I'd hire someone else to type for me.</div>

<br>
&gt; We know JFK was described as a "play boy" before being president and he certainly acted the part.<br>

<br>
If this was court, innocent until proven guilty, all you really have is heresay and circumstantial evidence at best, and slander at worst. Even your own links didn't have any real proof. <br>
<br>
&gt; I have sent a couple sources of them praising him. Notably the PBS one that put him in the top ten presidents. And again, the major news sources will hype up his womanizing. I'm pretty certain you've seen him praised, unless you're smart and don't have cable.<br>
<br>
I told you I did, it's just for communist ideology that he supported. <br>
<br>
&gt; Like what? Once again he criticized communists to a bunch of Jewish media executives <br>
<br>
If it was just Jewish media executives, how do we even hear that speech for ourselves?<br>

If we just want exposure Bush did with his New World Order speech, granted he was in favor of that.<br>
<br>
JFK had a good relationship with the Jewish press early on, which means he was praised as a pretty boy and had a lot of political sway. If he suddenly flips, he could bring the entire country against the jew and another Hitler would be born. He praised Hitler as one of the most prolific leaders in history, which was most likely the catalyst that got the ball rolling on his assassination. Johnson, Nixon, and the rest never had that media support. They weren't a threat. <br>
<br>
&gt; You are familiar with Kennedy's "ask not what your country can do for you" speech yes? <br>
<br>
The same one he made only to jew media execs? <br>
<br>
&gt; He was in favor of America being the world policemen. <br>
<br>
That wasn't his doing, that was the work of Jewish media and banking interests around the world creating problems "only he" could solve. They run to him and beat it into his head that "we need to help the little guy" all the while playing both sides, as has been the case for every war. <br>
<br>
&gt; He wasn't going to withdraw the troops he sent. Especially being so anti communist, his one and only good trait. Ellsberg also illegally leaked the Pentagon papers which sparked Watergate. His re-evaluation order was not an evacuation order. Every Vietnam historian I've seen across the political spectrum says JFK would have done the same as LBJ. Which makes sense, LBJ was just a more competent JFK.<br>
<br>
You're starting to jump around the topics here, let me start with JFK. He WAS going to bring the troops home, in fact the first wave were already returning when he was assassinated. Every Vietnam historian you've "seen" where, on TV? <br>
<br>
Ellsberg illegally leaked papers that were classified <span style="text-decoration:underline">once he turned on the jews</span>. JFK never had a scandal like that, as corrupt as he was, why? Why did they have to kill him? <br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah all things considered I'm saying beyond a reasonable doubt. <br>
<br>
Yet I still doubt. <br>
<br>
&gt; Others? Being Clinton, Reagan, and Trump? And a couple odd accusations here and there. I find him sleeping with a 19 year old in his 40s especially disgusting, and his brother drowned his mistress.<br>
<br>
I've yet to see the source on that. <br>
<br>
&gt; But strictly speaking all affairs are equal (well minus the drowned mistress), I find the others disgusting too, but we aren't talking about them. <br>
<br>
How do we know it was him and not some kike trying to silence a potential problem? <br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah because what else would they praise him for? That's all he did. Again, the big sources tend to praise him for that, the smaller ones don't.<br>
<br>
&gt; Stalin was Georgian, but don't get me wrong I don't like him. <br>
<br>
You could have fooled me by the way you praised his actions against jews vs. JFK. <br>
<br>
&gt; He did in fact make Christianity legal during WW2, but that might have been pragmatism as no one wanted to fight for communism. At the end he came to realize what every honest person does, Jews aren't trustworthy. So began the doctor's plot. Don't get me wrong he was still a monster, however he did more against Jews than Kennedy (who did absolutely nothing).<br>
<br>
Yet youre STILL praising him as a do gooder. I like how you slyly ignore his mass murder of millions yet "he relegalized muh Christianity!" as if that somehow obsolves him of being a mass murderer of the very Christians he was "relegalizing". Like, think about that term. <br>
<br>
"Relegalize"<br>
<br>
If you have a guy with a machine gun, killing women and children because he said they're illegal, then decries they're suddenly legal, does that mean he is to be praised for "coming to realize what every honest person does"? <br>
<br>
&gt; I mean I like GLR, but I don't think he was there.<br>
<br>
He was a man in a position to know what he was talking about. He was plugged into the political and media circles enough to get these facts. He sourced every fact he stated and no one, as desperate as they were to discredit him, could prove him wrong despite a $1,000 reward to anyone that could. So if you're going to use a "he wasn't in the room at the time" means to discredit him, burden of proof is on you to prove he was lying or didn't have the facts.</div>

That wasn't his doing, that was the work of Jewish media and banking interests around the world creating problems "only he" could solve. They run to him and beat it into his head that "we need to help the little guy" all the while playing both sides, as has been the case for every war. <br>
<br>
&gt; He wasn't going to withdraw the troops he sent. Especially being so anti communist, his one and only good trait. Ellsberg also illegally leaked the Pentagon papers which sparked Watergate. His re-evaluation order was not an evacuation order. Every Vietnam historian I've seen across the political spectrum says JFK would have done the same as LBJ. Which makes sense, LBJ was just a more competent JFK.<br>
<br>
You're starting to jump around the topics here, let me start with JFK. He WAS going to bring the troops home, in fact the first wave were already returning when he was assassinated. Every Vietnam historian you've "seen" where, on TV? <br>
<br>
Ellsberg illegally leaked papers that were classified <span style="text-decoration:underline">once he turned on the jews</span>. JFK never had a scandal like that, as corrupt as he was, why? Why did they have to kill him? <br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah all things considered I'm saying beyond a reasonable doubt. <br>
<br>
Yet I still doubt. <br>
<br>
&gt; Others? Being Clinton, Reagan, and Trump? And a couple odd accusations here and there. I find him sleeping with a 19 year old in his 40s especially disgusting, and his brother drowned his mistress.<br>
<br>
I've yet to see the source on that. <br>
<br>
&gt; But strictly speaking all affairs are equal (well minus the drowned mistress), I find the others disgusting too, but we aren't talking about them. <br>
<br>
How do we know it was him and not some kike trying to silence a potential problem? <br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah because what else would they praise him for? That's all he did. Again, the big sources tend to praise him for that, the smaller ones don't.<br>
<br>
&gt; Stalin was Georgian, but don't get me wrong I don't like him. <br>
<br>
You could have fooled me by the way you praised his actions against jews vs. JFK. <br>
<br>
&gt; He did in fact make Christianity legal during WW2, but that might have been pragmatism as no one wanted to fight for communism. At the end he came to realize what every honest person does, Jews aren't trustworthy. So began the doctor's plot. Don't get me wrong he was still a monster, however he did more against Jews than Kennedy (who did absolutely nothing).<br>
<br>
Yet youre STILL praising him as a do gooder. I like how you slyly ignore his mass murder of millions yet "he relegalized muh Christianity!" as if that somehow obsolves him of being a mass murderer of the very Christians he was "relegalizing". Like, think about that term. <br>
<br>
"Relegalize"<br>
<br>
If you have a guy with a machine gun, killing women and children because he said they're illegal, then decries they're suddenly legal, does that mean he is to be praised for "coming to realize what every honest person does"? <br>
<br>
&gt; I mean I like GLR, but I don't think he was there.<br>
<br>
He was a man in a position to know what he was talking about. He was plugged into the political and media circles enough to get these facts. He sourced every fact he stated and no one, as desperate as they were to discredit him, could prove him wrong despite a $1,000 reward to anyone that could. So if you're going to use a "he wasn't in the room at the time" means to discredit him, burden of proof is on you to prove he was lying or didn't have the facts.
</div></blockquote>
To start I'm going to ask for a little respect. I have been respectful of you yes? I expect the same. Especially when I have been using sources and explanations when you've never beat your burden of proof, that Kennedy secretly was against his brothers and his own words and actions, and hated Jews. I shall try to be polite still but I may reciprocate perceived snark.<br>
<br>
I have seen no proof he was Jewish. Prove it.<br>
<br>
Ted Kennedy literally drowned his mistress?<br>
Sorry it's Wiki but it has the court rulings:<br>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident" class="postlink">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident</a><br>
<br>
I have linked to the women, staff, and media calling him a play boy. It is now your job to prove they are lying. Saying others were accused in the future is a flimsy defense btw. I believe it is some sort of logical fallacy.<br>
<br>
Because that's all Kennedy did.<br>
<br>
Why wouldn't we have it? He was praising them. Besides it's not like the president doesn't write down his speeches.<br>
<br>
Nixon did nothing wrong. I'd argue tax evasion isn't a crime for Agnew, it's at least a victimless one. Because we have no record of Kennedy saying anything against Jews, at least not one you've provided. The Jew prefers to scandalize his rivals rather than martyr them.<br>
<br>
No? Which you should know, I've linked you both of them before. Two different speeches.<br>
<br>
Okay but either way he still supported America policing the world, doesn't matter who convinced him.<br>
<br>
Prove he was going to bring the troops he sent to Vietnam home. I want a link to the first hand order.<br>
<br>
You haven't proven Jews killed JFK. Kennedy had the Cuban missile crisis he caused by being a queer in front of Kruschev, otherwise because he was in bed with the media.<br>
<br>
The 19 year old? You did. Chappaquiddick? Linked above.<br>
Because he admitted to it? My bad but I did think you'd know that one.<br>
<br>
You're just upset the facts don't support you.<br>
I merely state facts, and Christianity was banned under Lenin. I can state facts about Stalin without liking him.<br>
<br>
Ok prove it. But first prove JFK was secretly against Jews. His death doesn't, especially since you haven't proven Jews killed him (which alone wouldn't prove it as Jews enjoy discarding puppets).<br>
Oh you said JFK would be the next Hitler somewhere, I'm sorry but that's retarded. No the guy who got a black communist/rapist rioter out of jail was not the next Hitler. Churchill respected Hitler too, didn't mean he was going to be him. Rudeness over. Hitler wrote a book detailing exactly what he believed and what he wanted to do, he was up front and honest in the Jew run Weimar Republic. He did not lie or steal an election to get power.<br>
<br>
Also a thought occurred to me. You are using similar points as the cult of Q. "Trump/JFK was against the Jews despite saying he supported them, working for them, and having his family do the same. He was simply playing 4D chess without us knowing. However the Jews somehow knew and that's why they stole the election/killed him. Look how much he did to expose them! [Insert no sources]." I don't intend that to be rude, but it is food for thought. Maybe you should consider that most things aren't secrets, for example anyone who chooses to do a little research will discover the Hololocaust is a lie even today. If JFK were an anti-semite/supporter of America it would probably be smack dab on kikepidea, it is for every known one.</div>

&gt; Yes, but as stated, I don't define a retard who follows a dead end Jewish ideology as being Jewish. I define him as a retard. Okay but same deal with Kennedy, he did everything they wanted before and while president. At no point did anything he did suggest he was against them, just like Trump.<br>
<br>
So you're deflecting attention away from the fact he was an ethnic jew? Hmm... Interesting. <br>
<br>
&gt; Okay, we know his brothers were man whores. <br>
<br>
How? Beyond heresay...<br>
<br>
&gt; We know JFK was described as a "play boy" before being president and he certainly acted the part.<br>
<br>
He was described in jew media as a playboy, during an era where jew media was promoting that lifestyle via Hugh Heffner; a direct attack on the family unit. They knew if promoted long enough, it would catch on.  <br>
<br>
&gt; We supposedly know his friends described him as that, <br>
<br>
"Supposedly" "Know" <br>
<br>
Does not compute<br>
<br>
&gt; though because journalists can't write we can't say that for certain. We know the women claim it with stories that don't sound far fetched. <br>
<br>
Subjective at best. <br>
<br>
&gt; I think the point is about wrapped up here. I feel we have passed reasonable doubt.<br>
<br>
"I think"<br>
<br>
If this was court, innocent until proven guilty, all you really have is heresay and circumstantial evidence at best, and slander at worst. Even your own links didn't have any real proof. <br>
<br>
&gt; I have sent a couple sources of them praising him. Notably the PBS one that put him in the top ten presidents. And again, the major news sources will hype up his womanizing. I'm pretty certain you've seen him praised, unless you're smart and don't have cable.<br>
<br>
I told you I did, it's just for communist ideology that he supported. <br>
<br>
&gt; Like what? Once again he criticized communists to a bunch of Jewish media executives <br>
<br>
If it was just Jewish media executives, how do we even hear that speech for ourselves?<br>
<br>
&gt; while saying they were great and that he wanted them to, effectively, hide information from Americans. I'm not seeing that as some secretly anti-Semitic speech, and if it were he's a retard for telling it to a bunch of Jewish executives. <br>
<br>
Yet we all have heard that speech...<br>
<br>
&gt; Compared to Nixon who said Jews weren't trustworthy and was forced to resign and Agnew who said the media was run by corrupt liars on Nixon's behalf and was forced to resign (well and for tax fraud), <br>
<br>
Exactly, they're all guilty to some degree, and when they bite the hand that feeds them, their corruption is used against them. I still don't see how JFK's stands above the rest. <br>
<br>
&gt; even Ford cut aid to Israel and New York; Kennedy doesn't compare. Them not killing Nixon makes more sense. First he won the popular vote by over 60%, second Agnew would have become president, third it's a far more Jewish thing to remove him than kill him (I want to add further clarity to that, but words fail me, hopefully you get what I mean). If we just want exposure Bush did with his New World Order speech, granted he was in favor of that.<br>
<br>
JFK had a good relationship with the Jewish press early on, which means he was praised as a pretty boy and had a lot of political sway. If he suddenly flips, he could bring the entire country against the jew and another Hitler would be born. He praised Hitler as one of the most prolific leaders in history, which was most likely the catalyst that got the ball rolling on his assassination. Johnson, Nixon, and the rest never had that media support. They weren't a threat. <br>
<br>
&gt; You are familiar with Kennedy's "ask not what your country can do for you" speech yes? <br>
<br>
The same one he made only to jew media execs? <br>
<br>
&gt; He was in favor of America being the world policemen. <br>
<br>
That wasn't his doing, that was the work of Jewish media and banking interests around the world creating problems "only he" could solve. They run to him and beat it into his head that "we need to help the little guy" all the while playing both sides, as has been the case for every war. <br>
<br>
&gt; He wasn't going to withdraw the troops he sent. Especially being so anti communist, his one and only good trait. Ellsberg also illegally leaked the Pentagon papers which sparked Watergate.

<br>
I guess I don't follow. What part of my response was disrespectful? <br>
<br>
&gt; I have seen no proof he was Jewish. Prove it.<br>
<br>
That Jewish garb for starters. I also sent you several links proving it. I thought you were above cognitive dissonance. <br>
<br>
&gt; Ted Kennedy literally drowned his mistress?<br>
Sorry it's Wiki but it has the court rulings:<br>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident" class="postlink">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident</a><br>
<br>
Thank you, I actually never heard of that incident. That said, you made it sound like he drowned her in a bathtub intentionally. This was a tad different. <br>
<br>
&gt; I have linked to the women, staff, and media calling him a play boy. It is now your job to prove they are lying. Saying others were accused in the future is a flimsy defense btw. I believe it is some sort of logical fallacy.<br>
<br>
So you're going with a "No U" argument? Weak. <br>
<br>
&gt; Because that's all Kennedy did.<br>
<br>
Says the guy who admired FDR ffs. <br>
<br>
&gt; Why wouldn't we have it? He was praising them. Besides it's not like the president doesn't write down his speeches. <br>
<br>
We haven't had an honest president since Wilson, yet you're fixated on JFK specifically. FDR appointed more jews to his cabinet than JFK did and you admired that kike. <br>
<br>
&gt; Nixon did nothing wrong. I'd argue tax evasion isn't a crime for Agnew, it's at least a victimless one. Because we have no record of Kennedy saying anything against Jews, at least not one you've provided. The Jew prefers to scandalize his rivals rather than martyr them.<br>
<br>
He's guilty of everything you claim JFK was but he gets a pass for some reason. This is the man who said "when the president does it its NOT illegal!" Nixon/Frost interviews. <br>
<br>
&gt; No? Which you should know, I've linked you both of them before. Two different speeches.<br>
<br>
I figured they were the same one, I didn't go back and reclick each link. <br>
<br>
&gt; Okay but either way he still supported America policing the world, doesn't matter who convinced him.<br>
<br>
So has every other president since 1913, but JFK man bad. <br>
<br>
&gt; Prove he was going to bring the troops he sent to Vietnam home. I want a link to the first hand order.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://bostonreview.net/us/galbraith-exit-strategy-vietnam" class="postlink">http://bostonreview.net/us/galbraith-ex ... gy-vietnam</a><br>

If you want the actual order, visit the Library of Congress. <br>
<br>
&gt; You haven't proven Jews killed JFK. Kennedy had the Cuban missile crisis he caused by being a queer in front of Kruschev, otherwise because he was in bed with the media.<br>
<br>
Yes I did. You just mentally gymnastics your way around it and claim my source "wasn't in the room". <br>
<br>
&gt; The 19 year old? You did. Chappaquiddick? Linked above.<br>
Because he admitted to it? My bad but I did think you'd know that one.<br>
<br>
I wasn't referring to the 19 yr. old. <br>
<br>
&gt; You're just upset the facts don't support you.<br>
I merely state facts, and Christianity was banned under Lenin. I can state facts about Stalin without liking him.<br>
<br>
My facts support me just fine. It's your newfound cognitive dissonance that reinforces my points. You've displayed a genuine respect for the mass murderer but not the US president. <br>
<br>
&gt; Ok prove it. But first prove JFK was secretly against Jews. His death doesn't, especially since you haven't proven Jews killed him (which alone wouldn't prove it as Jews enjoy discarding puppets).<br>
<br>
Well, you've ignored my sources before, so here: <br>

<br>
&gt; Oh you said JFK would be the next Hitler somewhere, I'm sorry but that's retarded.<br>
<br>
I never said that. I said if he flipped he had the potential to sway the entire country against jew communists because of his good relationship with the media early on. It was his support that was the real threat. If he flipped, he could have done in the jew's eyes, what Hitler did. I also linked it above. Don't try changing what I said. <br>
<br>
&gt;  No the guy who got a black communist/rapist rioter out of jail was not the next Hitler. Churchill respected Hitler too, didn't mean he was going to be him. Rudeness over.

So you go from complaining about disrespect to being rude... Interesting. <br>
<br>
&gt; Also a thought occurred to me. You are using similar points as the cult of Q. "Trump/JFK was against the Jews despite saying he supported them, working for them, and having his family do the same. He was simply playing 4D chess without us knowing. However the Jews somehow knew and that's why they stole the election/killed him. Look how much he did to expose them! [Insert no sources]." I don't intend that to be rude, but it is food for thought. Maybe you should consider that most things aren't secrets, for example anyone who chooses to do a little research will discover the Hololocaust is a lie even today. If JFK were an anti-semite/supporter of America it would probably be smack dab on kikepidea, it is for every known one.<br>
<br>
So... No intent to be rude but I'm the same as a Q fag? I'm starting to see what @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=149174" class="username">merlynn132</a> was talking about, and we've never gotten along.</div>

&gt; Yes, but as stated, I don't define a retard who follows a dead end Jewish ideology as being Jewish. I define him as a retard. Okay but same deal with Kennedy, he did everything they wanted before and while president. At no point did anything he did suggest he was against them, just like Trump.<br>
<br>
So you're deflecting attention away from the fact he was an ethnic jew? Hmm... Interesting. <br>
<br>
&gt; Okay, we know his brothers were man whores. <br>
<br>
How? Beyond heresay...<br>
<br>
&gt; We know JFK was described as a "play boy" before being president and he certainly acted the part.<br>
<br>
He was described in jew media as a playboy, during an era where jew media was promoting that lifestyle via Hugh Heffner; a direct attack on the family unit. They knew if promoted long enough, it would catch on.  <br>
<br>
&gt; We supposedly know his friends described him as that, <br>
<br>
"Supposedly" "Know" <br>
<br>
Does not compute<br>
<br>
&gt; though because journalists can't write we can't say that for certain. We know the women claim it with stories that don't sound far fetched. <br>
<br>
Subjective at best. <br>
<br>
&gt; I think the point is about wrapped up here. I feel we have passed reasonable doubt.<br>
<br>
"I think"<br>
<br>
If this was court, innocent until proven guilty, all you really have is heresay and circumstantial evidence at best, and slander at worst. Even your own links didn't have any real proof. <br>
<br>
&gt; I have sent a couple sources of them praising him. Notably the PBS one that put him in the top ten presidents. And again, the major news sources will hype up his womanizing. I'm pretty certain you've seen him praised, unless you're smart and don't have cable.<br>
<br>
I told you I did, it's just for communist ideology that he supported. <br>
<br>
&gt; Like what? Once again he criticized communists to a bunch of Jewish media executives <br>
<br>
If it was just Jewish media executives, how do we even hear that speech for ourselves?<br>
<br>
&gt; while saying they were great and that he wanted them to, effectively, hide information from Americans. I'm not seeing that as some secretly anti-Semitic speech, and if it were he's a retard for telling it to a bunch of Jewish executives. <br>
<br>
Yet we all have heard that speech...<br>
<br>
&gt; Compared to Nixon who said Jews weren't trustworthy and was forced to resign and Agnew who said the media was run by corrupt liars on Nixon's behalf and was forced to resign (well and for tax fraud), <br>
<br>
Exactly, they're all guilty to some degree, and when they bite the hand that feeds them, their corruption is used against them. I still don't see how JFK's stands above the rest. <br>
<br>
&gt; even Ford cut aid to Israel and New York; Kennedy doesn't compare. Them not killing Nixon makes more sense. First he won the popular vote by over 60%, second Agnew would have become president, third it's a far more Jewish thing to remove him than kill him (I want to add further clarity to that, but words fail me, hopefully you get what I mean). If we just want exposure Bush did with his New World Order speech, granted he was in favor of that.<br>
<br>
JFK had a good relationship with the Jewish press early on, which means he was praised as a pretty boy and had a lot of political sway. If he suddenly flips, he could bring the entire country against the jew and another Hitler would be born. He praised Hitler as one of the most prolific leaders in history, which was most likely the catalyst that got the ball rolling on his assassination. Johnson, Nixon, and the rest never had that media support. They weren't a threat. <br>
<br>
&gt; You are familiar with Kennedy's "ask not what your country can do for you" speech yes? <br>
<br>
The same one he made only to jew media execs? <br>
<br>
&gt; He was in favor of America being the world policemen. <br>
<br>
That wasn't his doing, that was the work of Jewish media and banking interests around the world creating problems "only he" could solve. They run to him and beat it into his head that "we need to help the little guy" all the while playing both sides, as has been the case for every war. <br>
<br>
&gt; He wasn't going to withdraw the troops he sent. Especially being so anti communist, his one and only good trait. Ellsberg also illegally leaked the Pentagon papers which sparked Watergate. His re-evaluation order was not an evacuation order. Every Vietnam historian I've seen across the political spectrum says JFK would have done the same as LBJ. Which makes sense, LBJ was just a more competent JFK.<br>
<br>
You're starting to jump around the topics here, let me start with JFK. He WAS going to bring the troops home, in fact the first wave were already returning when he was assassinated. Every Vietnam historian you've "seen" where, on TV? <br>
<br>
Ellsberg illegally leaked papers that were classified <span style="text-decoration:underline">once he turned on the jews</span>. JFK never had a scandal like that, as corrupt as he was, why? Why did they have to kill him? <br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah all things considered I'm saying beyond a reasonable doubt. <br>
<br>
Yet I still doubt. <br>
<br>
&gt; Others? Being Clinton, Reagan, and Trump? And a couple odd accusations here and there. I find him sleeping with a 19 year old in his 40s especially disgusting, and his brother drowned his mistress.<br>
<br>
I've yet to see the source on that. <br>
<br>
&gt; But strictly speaking all affairs are equal (well minus the drowned mistress), I find the others disgusting too, but we aren't talking about them. <br>
<br>
How do we know it was him and not some kike trying to silence a potential problem? <br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah because what else would they praise him for? That's all he did. Again, the big sources tend to praise him for that, the smaller ones don't.<br>
<br>
&gt; Stalin was Georgian, but don't get me wrong I don't like him. <br>
<br>
You could have fooled me by the way you praised his actions against jews vs. JFK. <br>
<br>
&gt; He did in fact make Christianity legal during WW2, but that might have been pragmatism as no one wanted to fight for communism. At the end he came to realize what every honest person does, Jews aren't trustworthy. So began the doctor's plot. Don't get me wrong he was still a monster, however he did more against Jews than Kennedy (who did absolutely nothing).<br>
<br>
Yet youre STILL praising him as a do gooder. I like how you slyly ignore his mass murder of millions yet "he relegalized muh Christianity!" as if that somehow obsolves him of being a mass murderer of the very Christians he was "relegalizing". Like, think about that term. <br>
<br>
"Relegalize"<br>
<br>
If you have a guy with a machine gun, killing women and children because he said they're illegal, then decries they're suddenly legal, does that mean he is to be praised for "coming to realize what every honest person does"? <br>
<br>
&gt; I mean I like GLR, but I don't think he was there.<br>
<br>
He was a man in a position to know what he was talking about. He was plugged into the political and media circles enough to get these facts. He sourced every fact he stated and no one, as desperate as they were to discredit him, could prove him wrong despite a $1,000 reward to anyone that could. So if you're going to use a "he wasn't in the room at the time" means to discredit him, burden of proof is on you to prove he was lying or didn't have the facts.
</div></blockquote>

To start I'm going to ask for a little respect. I have been respectful of you yes? I expect the same. Especially when I have been using sources and explanations when you've never beat your burden of proof, that Kennedy secretly was against his brothers and his own words and actions, and hated Jews. I shall try to be polite still but I may reciprocate perceived snark. </div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
I guess I don't follow. What part of my response was disrespectful? <br>
<br>
&gt; I have seen no proof he was Jewish. Prove it.<br>
<br>
That Jewish garb for starters. I also sent you several links proving it. I thought you were above cognitive dissonance. <br>
<br>
&gt; Ted Kennedy literally drowned his mistress?<br>
Sorry it's Wiki but it has the court rulings:<br>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident" class="postlink">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident</a><br>
<br>
Thank you, I actually never heard of that incident. That said, you made it sound like he drowned her in a bathtub intentionally. This was a tad different. <br>
<br>
&gt; I have linked to the women, staff, and media calling him a play boy. It is now your job to prove they are lying. Saying others were accused in the future is a flimsy defense btw. I believe it is some sort of logical fallacy.<br>
<br>
So you're going with a "No U" argument? Weak. <br>
<br>
&gt; Because that's all Kennedy did.<br>
<br>
Says the guy who admired FDR ffs. <br>
<br>
&gt; Why wouldn't we have it? He was praising them. Besides it's not like the president doesn't write down his speeches. <br>
<br>
We haven't had an honest president since Wilson, yet you're fixated on JFK specifically. FDR appointed more jews to his cabinet than JFK did and you admired that kike. <br>
<br>
&gt; Nixon did nothing wrong. I'd argue tax evasion isn't a crime for Agnew, it's at least a victimless one. Because we have no record of Kennedy saying anything against Jews, at least not one you've provided. The Jew prefers to scandalize his rivals rather than martyr them.<br>
<br>
He's guilty of everything you claim JFK was but he gets a pass for some reason. This is the man who said "when the president does it its NOT illegal!" Nixon/Frost interviews. <br>
<br>
&gt; No? Which you should know, I've linked you both of them before. Two different speeches.<br>
<br>
I figured they were the same one, I didn't go back and reclick each link. <br>
<br>
&gt; Okay but either way he still supported America policing the world, doesn't matter who convinced him.<br>
<br>
So has every other president since 1913, but JFK man bad. <br>
<br>
&gt; Prove he was going to bring the troops he sent to Vietnam home. I want a link to the first hand order.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://bostonreview.net/us/galbraith-exit-strategy-vietnam" class="postlink">http://bostonreview.net/us/galbraith-ex ... gy-vietnam</a><br>
<br>
If you want the actual order, visit the Library of Congress. <br>
<br>
&gt; You haven't proven Jews killed JFK. Kennedy had the Cuban missile crisis he caused by being a queer in front of Kruschev, otherwise because he was in bed with the media.<br>
<br>
Yes I did. You just mentally gymnastics your way around it and claim my source "wasn't in the room". <br>
<br>
&gt; The 19 year old? You did. Chappaquiddick? Linked above.<br>
Because he admitted to it? My bad but I did think you'd know that one.<br>
<br>
I wasn't referring to the 19 yr. old. <br>
<br>
&gt; You're just upset the facts don't support you.<br>
I merely state facts, and Christianity was banned under Lenin. I can state facts about Stalin without liking him.<br>
<br>
My facts support me just fine. It's your newfound cognitive dissonance that reinforces my points. You've displayed a genuine respect for the mass murderer but not the US president. <br>
<br>
&gt; Ok prove it. But first prove JFK was secretly against Jews. His death doesn't, especially since you haven't proven Jews killed him (which alone wouldn't prove it as Jews enjoy discarding puppets).<br>
<br>
Well, you've ignored my sources before, so here: <br>
<br>
<a href="https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/697" class="postlink">https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/697</a><br>
<br>
It appears Bobby was more of their puppet, but even they said their dad was against them. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium.MAGAZINE-how-bobby-kennedy-cemented-his-relationship-with-u-s-jews-1.5411743" class="postlink">https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium ... -1.5411743</a><br>
<br>
&gt; Oh you said JFK would be the next Hitler somewhere, I'm sorry but that's retarded.<br>
<br>
I never said that. I said if he flipped he had the potential to sway the entire country against jew communists because of his good relationship with the media early on. It was his support that was the real threat. If he flipped, he could have done in the jew's eyes, what Hitler did. I also linked it above. Don't try changing what I said. <br>
<br>
&gt;  No the guy who got a black communist/rapist rioter out of jail was not the next Hitler. Churchill respected Hitler too, didn't mean he was going to be him. Rudeness over. Hitler wrote a book detailing exactly what he believed and what he wanted to do, he was up front and honest in the Jew run Weimar Republic. He did not lie or steal an election to get power.<br>
<br>
So you go from complaining about disrespect to being rude... Interesting. <br>
<br>
&gt; Also a thought occurred to me. You are using similar points as the cult of Q. "Trump/JFK was against the Jews despite saying he supported them, working for them, and having his family do the same. He was simply playing 4D chess without us knowing. However the Jews somehow knew and that's why they stole the election/killed him. Look how much he did to expose them! [Insert no sources]." I don't intend that to be rude, but it is food for thought. Maybe you should consider that most things aren't secrets, for example anyone who chooses to do a little research will discover the Hololocaust is a lie even today. If JFK were an anti-semite/supporter of America it would probably be smack dab on kikepidea, it is for every known one.<br>
<br>
So... No intent to be rude but I'm the same as a Q fag? I'm starting to see what @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=149174" class="username">merlynn132</a> was talking about, and we've never gotten along.
</div></blockquote>
How are you disrespectful? Insinuating I'm a Jew when I prove you wrong? Then you're disrespectful right away again.<br>
<br>
The Jewish garb? I ain't seeing no skull cap. And no? I have not received a link on that. I may have missed it but I don't think I did.<br>
<br>
Ah. Well anyway it shows Ted Kennedy had affairs and was corrupt.<br>
<br>
It is the burden of proof. I have met it. You must prove they are lying, good luck.<br>
<br>
I never said I admired FDR. We originally said he was Jewish with Argociv I believe, then you claimed here he was the most anti Semitic president. Now you're flipping again? What actually gives. Also guess who worked with FDR.<br>
<br>
Because the discussion is specifically about Kennedy? Go figure.<br>
<br>
No Nixon didn't do half the shit JFK did. He at least won.<br>
<br>
And you claim I don't read your links.<br>
<br>
You didn't, you merely claimed your source was credible without proving it, and even then I have several agreed upon credible sources that say otherwise.<br>
<br>
No I stated a fact on a mass murderer. Yes sorry if I don't respect a fraudulent president whose every action was anti white.<br>
<br>
Joseph Kennedy is not John Kennedy. Plus his views on WW2 were a matter of pragmatism and honesty. Anyone could see the Nazi had done nothing wrong. Plus who likes Jews?<br>
More of a puppet meaning he literally died for Israel.<br>
<br>
Sorry, there was a better chance of Hell freezing over than of Kennedy flipping. Especially since he served them his entire career.<br>
<br>
I said since you were disrespectful I might reciprocate, considering how snarky you were I think I did a good job of being polite.<br>
<br>
No but you argue like one. Surely you see it? Tell me how your points differ. Agreeing with an admitted hedonist and Zionist? Yikes.</div>

			<div class="content">Stalin wasn't a jew any more than Hitler was. That's pilpul to make people question their history. Kind of like what T-Bitty's trying to do with Kennedy. I'd start by asking how those are jewish clothes since I've never seen jews dressed like that. And even if they were,that doesn't mean Stalin's a jew for wearing it anymore than Trump is for wearing a tiny hat in Israel. Look at his actions. He removed the antisemitism and antichristian laws. No jew would do that,especially not the antisemitism laws. They also wouldn't purge jews from high office. That weakens jewish control,they wouldn't do that. It wouldn't make sense. Stalin grew up around and worked with jews his whole life. So he knew what they were and when he got the chance,he moved against them. Which is why the jews lost control of Russia and started red scare propaganda in the 50s,focused on Russia. It's also why the jews killed him.<br>
<br>
This line right here: "Joseph Kennedy is not John Kennedy. Plus his views on WW2 were a matter of pragmatism and honesty. Anyone could see the Nazi had done nothing wrong. Plus who likes Jews?"<br>
<br>
That's been the point of the whole argument. JFK hated the jews. He did what they wanted because it was necessary to gain high office. If he hadn't,he'd have been kicked out of office like Nixon was. Or did you not realize Woodward and Bernstein were jews? But in the end,he'd started doing too much shit to weaken their control and they had to get rid of him immediately. They didn't have time for a simple scandal to get him out of office. And Jack Ruby killed Oswald to keep him quiet. The hands of the jews are obvious to those who look for them.<br>
<br>
But no,everyone hates jews. Especially the people who work for them.</div>

			<div class="content">&gt; How are you disrespectful? Insinuating I'm a Jew when I prove you wrong? Then you're disrespectful right away again.<br>
<br>
You argue like a jew, just took a bit to get it out of ya. @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=149174" class="username">merlynn132</a> said it but I had to see it for myself. You act just like the jews on Ruqqus with the way you react when your sources are questioned and fall apart. <br>
<br>
&gt; The Jewish garb? I ain't seeing no skull cap. And no? I have not received a link on that. I may have missed it but I don't think I did.<br>
<br>
Are you just flat out ignoring all my sources? Scroll up, it's there and not even that far up. <br>
<br>
&gt; Ah. Well anyway it shows Ted Kennedy had affairs and was corrupt.<br>
<br>
See, here is the actual proof I was talking about. You provided a link that wasn't just heresay. He crashed his car with a female acquaintance, she died, he was officially charged for negligence. There's no denying that's what this is, even if he denied his type of relationship with her the mere fact he was with her in that circumstance would be highly questionable. <br>
<br>
&gt; It is the burden of proof. I have met it. You must prove they are lying, good luck.<br>
<br>
Then you go right back to heresay again. Burden of proof is on them. I care not the size of the group making a claim, groups can be paid to do so. (Look at Judge Kavanaugh) There has to be more evidence, like say with Clinton where the victim could describe his genitals and had pictures of herself with him (and British Royalty), giving him a back rub. You don't get to just stop shy of proving it by using heresay, then turn around and say "prove them wrong!". <br>
<br>
You are no Constitutionalist, that's for certain. <br>
<br>
&gt; I never said I admired FDR. We originally said he was Jewish with Argociv I believe, then you claimed here he was the most anti Semitic president. Now you're flipping again? What actually gives. Also guess who worked with FDR.<br>
<br>
*ahem* <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> 39. FDR. I considered putting him lower but, <strong class="text-strong">eh, <span style="text-decoration:underline">he didn't nuke a country after it surrendered</span>.</strong> FDR caused war with Japan by sending an ultimatum (the Hull note) to get out of French Indochina or else there would be war, this is extremely cruel as the note he was supposed to send was supposed to negotiate a permanent peace with Japan but he sidelined Congress. However <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I think his end goal of war was to fix the American economy</span></strong> as his poor policies had failed to do so, as opposed to wanting to give Jews world domination, although he might have been Jewish. If I'm right he technically succeeded. He also wanted Germany to keep more land after the war (although as multiple countries). His popularity at the time is over exaggerated as in 1940 the Republicans choose to run the least popular candidate Wilkie who was the only one who was openly pro war, and he still managed to win 45% of the vote.</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
To which @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=557" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">Tallest_Skil</a> destroyed you: <br>

39. FDR. I considered putting him lower but, eh, he didn't nuke a country after it surrendered.</div></blockquote>

No, he just sold it into slavery for all eternity, violated every law on the books, and created every president’s administration after him. He’s the worst. He personally caused WWII. He’s PERSONALLY the reason that Japan was destroyed, China conquered Asia, Germany fell, the Cold War happened, 160,000,000 were killed by communism, and jews conquered the entire fucking world. It was him and him alone.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>However I think his end goal of war was to fix the American economy</div></blockquote>

His end goal was to serve his jewish brethren and conquer the fucking world. He destroyed America, on purpose, by implementing communism.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He also wanted Germany to keep more land after the war (although as multiple countries).</div></blockquote>

So... jewish D&amp;C, which is the opposite of “keeping more land.”<br>

</div></blockquote>

&gt; Because the discussion is specifically about Kennedy? Go figure.<br>
<br>
No, the discussion was how I redpilled Ruqqus, then you slid it into another field of discussion. <br>
<br>
&gt; No Nixon didn't do half the shit JFK did. He at least won.<br>
<br>
You never proved election fraud. <br>
<br>
&gt; And you claim I don't read your links.<br>
<br>
If you did, you would have seen my proof that Stalin had Jewish ethnicity. <br>
<br>
&gt; You didn't, you merely claimed your source was credible without proving it, and even then I have several agreed upon credible sources that say otherwise.<br>
<br>
No, this is projection. Your sources were chock full of heresay, and parrots don't make proof. <br>
<br>
&gt; No I stated a fact on a mass murderer. Yes sorry if I don't respect a fraudulent president whose every action was anti white.<br>
<br>
Then you ignore Stalin's anti white actions via <strong class="text-strong">fucking murder</strong>... This is how you lose credibility. <br>
<br>
&gt; Joseph Kennedy is not John Kennedy. Plus his views on WW2 were a matter of pragmatism and honesty. Anyone could see the Nazi had done nothing wrong. Plus who likes Jews?<br>
More of a puppet meaning he literally died for Israel.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I believe you stated he was the same way. "Just as bad" IIRC. <br>
<br>
&gt; Sorry, there was a better chance of Hell freezing over than of Kennedy flipping. Especially since he served them his entire career.<br>
<br>
Yet they still killed him. And his shabbos goy brother. <br>
<br>
&gt; I said since you were disrespectful I might reciprocate, considering how snarky you were I think I did a good job of being polite.<br>
<br>
If that's what you call doing a good job of being polite, I wonder how you'd act if I actually disrespected you. But then again, I recall your banter with merlynn. You're not above childish name calling and trollolol. <br>
<br>
&gt; No but you argue like one. Surely you see it? Tell me how your points differ. Agreeing with an admitted hedonist and Zionist? Yikes.<br>
<br>
Vs. agreeing with a proven mass murderer?</div>

No jew would do that,especially not the antisemitism laws. They also wouldn't purge jews from high office. That weakens jewish control,they wouldn't do that. It wouldn't make sense. Stalin grew up around and worked with jews his whole life. So he knew what they were and when he got the chance,he moved against them. Which is why the jews lost control of Russia and started red scare propaganda in the 50s,focused on Russia. It's also why the jews killed him.<br>
<br>
This line right here: "Joseph Kennedy is not John Kennedy. Plus his views on WW2 were a matter of pragmatism and honesty. Anyone could see the Nazi had done nothing wrong. Plus who likes Jews?"<br>
<br>
That's been the point of the whole argument. JFK hated the jews. He did what they wanted because it was necessary to gain high office. If he hadn't,he'd have been kicked out of office like Nixon was. Or did you not realize Woodward and Bernstein were jews? But in the end,he'd started doing too much shit to weaken their control and they had to get rid of him immediately. They didn't have time for a simple scandal to get him out of office. And Jack Ruby killed Oswald to keep him quiet. The hands of the jews are obvious to those who look for them.<br>
<br>
But no,everyone hates jews. Especially the people who work for them.
</div></blockquote>

Yes Stalin was, it was something like 1/4 jew on his grandfathers side. They hide this fact so no one can claim communism is pure Jewish. Those clothes are Khazakstanian or something similar, but he's standing next to a self admitted jew and looks identical. <br>
<br>
Trump is a shabbos goy as his kids married jews. Not even Stalin was at the wailing wall. <br>
<br>
He made antisemitism punishable by death in the first place, this is not absolved by undoing it later. He only undid it to consolidate power under the guise of nationalism. Even Hitler stated he admired him because he thinks in centuries. We never seem to focus on his mass murder of white Christians in the meantime though.</div>

&gt; How are you disrespectful? Insinuating I'm a Jew when I prove you wrong? Then you're disrespectful right away again.<br>
<br>
You argue like a jew, just took a bit to get it out of ya. @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=149174" class="username">merlynn132</a> said it but I had to see it for myself. You act just like the jews on Ruqqus with the way you react when your sources are questioned and fall apart. <br>
<br>
&gt; The Jewish garb? I ain't seeing no skull cap. And no? I have not received a link on that. I may have missed it but I don't think I did.<br>
<br>
Are you just flat out ignoring all my sources? Scroll up, it's there and not even that far up. <br>
<br>
&gt; Ah. Well anyway it shows Ted Kennedy had affairs and was corrupt.<br>
<br>
See, here is the actual proof I was talking about. You provided a link that wasn't just heresay. He crashed his car with a female acquaintance, she died, he was officially charged for negligence. There's no denying that's what this is, even if he denied his type of relationship with her the mere fact he was with her in that circumstance would be highly questionable. <br>
<br>
&gt; It is the burden of proof. I have met it. You must prove they are lying, good luck.<br>
<br>
Then you go right back to heresay again. Burden of proof is on them. I care not the size of the group making a claim, groups can be paid to do so. (Look at Judge Kavanaugh) There has to be more evidence, like say with Clinton where the victim could describe his genitals and had pictures of herself with him (and British Royalty), giving him a back rub. You don't get to just stop shy of proving it by using heresay, then turn around and say "prove them wrong!". <br>
<br>
You are no Constitutionalist, that's for certain. <br>
<br>
&gt; I never said I admired FDR. We originally said he was Jewish with Argociv I believe, then you claimed here he was the most anti Semitic president. Now you're flipping again? What actually gives. Also guess who worked with FDR.<br>
<br>
*ahem* <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> 39. FDR. I considered putting him lower but, <strong class="text-strong">eh, <span style="text-decoration:underline">he didn't nuke a country after it surrendered</span>.</strong> FDR caused war with Japan by sending an ultimatum (the Hull note) to get out of French Indochina or else there would be war, this is extremely cruel as the note he was supposed to send was supposed to negotiate a permanent peace with Japan but he sidelined Congress.

39. FDR. I considered putting him lower but, eh, he didn't nuke a country after it surrendered.</div></blockquote>

No, he just sold it into slavery for all eternity, violated every law on the books, and created every president’s administration after him. He’s the worst. He personally caused WWII. He’s PERSONALLY the reason that Japan was destroyed, China conquered Asia, Germany fell, the Cold War happened, 160,000,000 were killed by communism, and jews conquered the entire fucking world. It was him and him alone.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>However I think his end goal of war was to fix the American economy</div></blockquote>

His end goal was to serve his jewish brethren and conquer the fucking world. He destroyed America, on purpose, by implementing communism.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He also wanted Germany to keep more land after the war (although as multiple countries).</div></blockquote>

So... jewish D&amp;C, which is the opposite of “keeping more land.”<br>

</div></blockquote>

&gt; Because the discussion is specifically about Kennedy? Go figure.<br>
<br>
No, the discussion was how I redpilled Ruqqus, then you slid it into another field of discussion. <br>
<br>
&gt; No Nixon didn't do half the shit JFK did. He at least won.<br>
<br>
You never proved election fraud. <br>
<br>
&gt; And you claim I don't read your links.<br>
<br>
If you did, you would have seen my proof that Stalin had Jewish ethnicity. <br>
<br>
&gt; You didn't, you merely claimed your source was credible without proving it, and even then I have several agreed upon credible sources that say otherwise.<br>
<br>
No, this is projection. Your sources were chock full of heresay, and parrots don't make proof. <br>
<br>
&gt; No I stated a fact on a mass murderer. Yes sorry if I don't respect a fraudulent president whose every action was anti white.<br>
<br>
Then you ignore Stalin's anti white actions via <strong class="text-strong">fucking murder</strong>... This is how you lose credibility. <br>
<br>
&gt; Joseph Kennedy is not John Kennedy. Plus his views on WW2 were a matter of pragmatism and honesty. Anyone could see the Nazi had done nothing wrong. Plus who likes Jews?<br>
More of a puppet meaning he literally died for Israel.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I believe you stated he was the same way. "Just as bad" IIRC. <br>
<br>
&gt; Sorry, there was a better chance of Hell freezing over than of Kennedy flipping. Especially since he served them his entire career.<br>
<br>
Yet they still killed him. And his shabbos goy brother. <br>
<br>
&gt; I said since you were disrespectful I might reciprocate, considering how snarky you were I think I did a good job of being polite.<br>
<br>
If that's what you call doing a good job of being polite, I wonder how you'd act if I actually disrespected you. But then again, I recall your banter with merlynn. You're not above childish name calling and trollolol. <br>
<br>
&gt; No but you argue like one. Surely you see it? Tell me how your points differ. Agreeing with an admitted hedonist and Zionist? Yikes.<br>
<br>
Vs. agreeing with a proven mass murderer?
</div></blockquote>
Yes I'm clearly a Jew despite everything I've said showing I'm not. I never used Ruqqus, because as you say it's run by Jews, but is this how you argue? Drop a claim without evidence then call everyone who questions it a Jew? More evidence of you arguing like a Qultist, and it sounds like you're doing more harm if that's the case.<br>
<br>
You understand I am talking about Lee Harvey Oswald, not Stalin right?<br>
<br>
So Ted Kennedy drowned his mistress, and his family seemed not to care. Imagine what point you have to be at to more or less brush that off.<br>
Okay but said group contained people who would be unlikely to make it up.<br>
<br>
Yeah why don't you read that whole thread genius. Clearly I hate FDR but I put somethings blamed on him on Truman and Churchill. More land = Silesia and Pomerania. You literally read it. Yeah Tallest who usually agrees with me and I with him totally destroyed me by seemingly agreeing with me after I explained my points, if it makes you feel better. Now please explain your flip flopping on FDR.<br>
<br>
Because you made a false claim about Kennedy trying to end the Fed when he asked Congress to support it and get rid of the silver standard, and claimed Jews killed him without proof. Frankly this should have been dispelled with my first or second response. Here's to 100 though.<br>
<br>
I did. Judges who were friends with Kennedy and LBJ ruled there was voter fraud in favor of them, but not enough to sway an election. Texas didn't allow for recounts either. Plus we do know Nixon won the popular vote. All put together it's incredibly unlikely he lost.<br>
<br>
The question is about Oswald being Jewish, not Stalin. Although I did say he was Georgian. I'm waiting for proof Oswald was Jewish.<br>
<br>
You agreed the FBI was likely trustworthy at the time.<br>
<br>
Nigga what you think this is Plebbit? Everyone here knows Stalin is a mass murderer. I need not explain that here, plus that was initially to address one of merlynn's points who brought him up.<br>
<br>
I don't know what IIRC means and I don't follow your point here.<br>
<br>
Yet you haven't proven they killed him. And if they did that doesn't mean he was anti Jewish/pro American.<br>
<br>
I've been more polite than you. Absolutely, merlynn talks shit (as he does to everyone) I reply with shit, I see no problem there. If I recall you liked his post when he first went schizo and started name calling and lying about what my sources said.<br>
You are straw manning me about Stalin. And your argument is no different than the Qult. Even if Kennedy secretly hated the Jews (which he didn't) it doesn't matter when he did everything they wanted.</div>

Stalin wasn't a jew any more than Hitler was. That's pilpul to make people question their history. Kind of like what T-Bitty's trying to do with Kennedy. I'd start by asking how those are jewish clothes since I've never seen jews dressed like that. And even if they were,that doesn't mean Stalin's a jew for wearing it anymore than Trump is for wearing a tiny hat in Israel. Look at his actions. He removed the antisemitism and antichristian laws. No jew would do that,especially not the antisemitism laws. They also wouldn't purge jews from high office. That weakens jewish control,they wouldn't do that. It wouldn't make sense. Stalin grew up around and worked with jews his whole life. So he knew what they were and when he got the chance,he moved against them. Which is why the jews lost control of Russia and started red scare propaganda in the 50s,focused on Russia. It's also why the jews killed him.<br>
<br>
This line right here: "Joseph Kennedy is not John Kennedy. Plus his views on WW2 were a matter of pragmatism and honesty. Anyone could see the Nazi had done nothing wrong. Plus who likes Jews?"<br>
<br>
That's been the point of the whole argument. JFK hated the jews. He did what they wanted because it was necessary to gain high office. If he hadn't,he'd have been kicked out of office like Nixon was. Or did you not realize Woodward and Bernstein were jews? But in the end,he'd started doing too much shit to weaken their control and they had to get rid of him immediately. They didn't have time for a simple scandal to get him out of office. And Jack Ruby killed Oswald to keep him quiet. The hands of the jews are obvious to those who look for them.<br>
<br>
But no,everyone hates jews. Especially the people who work for them.

Name one thing JFK did that was anti Jewish or pro American. That is the point that must be proven.</div>

<br>
Yes Stalin was, it was something like 1/4 jew on his grandfathers side. They hide this fact so no one can claim communism is pure Jewish. Those clothes are Khazakstanian or something similar, but he's standing next to a self admitted jew and looks identical. <br>
<br>
Trump is a shabbos goy as his kids married jews. Not even Stalin was at the wailing wall. <br>
<br>
He made antisemitism punishable by death in the first place, this is not absolved by undoing it later. He only undid it to consolidate power under the guise of nationalism. Even Hitler stated he admired him because he thinks in centuries. We never seem to focus on his mass murder of white Christians in the meantime though.
</div></blockquote>

That was Lenin. We don't know who Stalin's father was and his mother being jewish was speculation. Here's a theory. What if Stalin's mom gave him the name "jewson" to get the kikes to pay for his education? It's just as valid as that other guy's. And we still have the point that he turned on the jews and removed them from power and removed those laws that protected them. Why would a jew do that? Why would a jew cut his own throat and betray the tribe for no reason?<br>
<br>
All his mass murder and pro-jew laws were probably done by jews with Stalin's forced ok. Lots of people have done horrible shit on the jews' say so and most of them were forced to do it. Why does that explanation not apply to Stalin? Why does it all rest on his head when we know the jews were in power and had a lot of pull? It's the same thing with T-Bitty's Kennedy bullshit. It's all Kennedy's fault,ignore the jews.<br>
<br>
Don't be like T-Bitty.</div>

I'd ask for sources but all 3 of those are untrue. The first 2 are complete opposites of the truth and the third ignores who Israel's pm was at the time (Levi Eshkol, essentially Bernie Sanders, he wanted to scrap Israel's nuclear program for continued American protection). As I explained before. More on points 3, 4, and 5:<br>

			<div class="content">&gt; Yes I'm clearly a Jew despite everything I've said showing I'm not. <br>
<br>
I never said you were a jew, I said you argue like one. That and your deflecting away from Jewish ethnicity was rather suspect given that you were trying to praise his anti Jewish actions. <br>
<br>
&gt; I never used Ruqqus, because as you say it's run by Jews, but is this how you argue? Drop a claim without evidence then call everyone who questions it a Jew?<br>
<br>
More lies, that's not what I did and you blatantly ignored my evidence and proof. I'm all for public debate and presentation of facts, but you're clearly trying to move the goalposts by dismissing facts that don't support your claims. Like JFK ordering the troops back from Vietnam. You conveniently forgot to acknowledge that proof and moved onto the next topic. <br>
<br>
&gt;  More evidence of you arguing like a Qultist, and it sounds like you're doing more harm if that's the case.<br>
<br>
You seem to be stuck in the Q mindset, I wonder why that would be. <br>
<br>
&gt; You understand I am talking about Lee Harvey Oswald, not Stalin right?<br>
<br>
You didn't specify and your format makes it confusing as to which point you're addressing. Oswald wasn't himself Jewish, he was indoctrinated into their communist clutches by the age of 14 while growing up in the jew infested Bronx, we covered this. <br>
<br>
&gt; So Ted Kennedy drowned his mistress, and his family seemed not to care. Imagine what point you have to be at to more or less brush that off.<br>
Okay but said group contained people who would be unlikely to make it up.<br>
<br>
Ted Kennedy did not drown her, he crashed the car that ended up in the water. His negligent driving killed her. He didn't hold her head under the water. Let's not mince words here. They're corrupt enough without having to dramatize it. <br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah why don't you read that whole thread genius. Clearly I hate FDR but I put somethings blamed on him on Truman and Churchill. More land = Silesia and Pomerania. You literally read it. Yeah Tallest who usually agrees with me and I with him totally destroyed me by seemingly agreeing with me after I explained my points, if it makes you feel better. Now please explain your flip flopping on FDR.<br>
<br>
He destroyed your logic, and I never saw him agree with your original point. I never flipped on FDR the guy was a kike. Case in point: <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/uzkfsz.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br>
<br>
He was the one that stole our gold. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/n5fdnm.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
On top of that, he changed the US Seal <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/sphap3.JPG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> and redesigned the $1 bill from this <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/rex0vc.JPG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> to the current version that reflects the Star of David. <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/bjuidb.JPG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br>
<br>
Yet he ranks higher than JFK in your book... <br>
<br>
&gt; Because you made a false claim about Kennedy trying to end the Fed when he asked Congress to support it and get rid of the silver standard, and claimed Jews killed him without proof. Frankly this should have been dispelled with my first or second response. Here's to 100 though.<br>
<br>
Running in circles you are. You never proved anything beyond vague interpretations that he was supporting the fed and Israel. I did prove jews killed him because they were stalking him even in Cuba. I told you of the float that Castro made in his Hate America parade depicting JFK in a coffin weeks before his assassination. But it's more fun to ignore said evidence and act like your assertions were all correct as if nothing happened. <br>
<br>
&gt; I did. Judges who were friends with Kennedy and LBJ ruled there was voter fraud in favor of them, but not enough to sway an election. Texas didn't allow for recounts either. Plus we do know Nixon won the popular vote. All put together it's incredibly unlikely he lost.<br>
<br>
Popular vote &lt; Electoral College <br>
<br>
Popular vote means shit. If we went strictly by popular vote, the only deciders for leaders would be NY, California, Chicago, and Florida. <br>
<br>
&gt; The question is about Oswald being Jewish, not Stalin. Although I did say he was Georgian. I'm waiting for proof Oswald was Jewish. <br>
<br>
You're deflecting, I never said he was Jewish and you did say Stalin was Georgian, which he was. How the fuck would I think you were talking about Oswald there? Stalin was Jewish, not Oswald. <br>
<br>
&gt; You agreed the FBI was likely trustworthy at the time.<br>
<br>
&gt; Nigga what you think this is Plebbit? Everyone here knows Stalin is a mass murderer. I need not explain that here, plus that was initially to address one of merlynn's points who brought him up.<br>
<br>
You ask if this is plebbit then talk like a nigger. You hold him in a higher regard than JFK. That's the hang up. <br>
<br>
&gt; I don't know what IIRC means and I don't follow your point here.<br>
<br>
If I Recall Correctly, because I wasn't going searching for it. <br>
<br>
&gt; Yet you haven't proven they killed him. And if they did that doesn't mean he was anti Jewish/pro American.<br>
<br>
I love your little escape pod you create lol. I did prove it, but you claimed I didn't. Just in case I do though, you insert a "that's not why" ahead of time? Kek <br>
<br>
&gt; I've been more polite than you. Absolutely, merlynn talks shit (as he does to everyone) I reply with shit, I see no problem there. If I recall you liked his post when he first went schizo and started name calling and lying about what my sources said.<br>
<br>
I also liked your posts rebutting him, but no mention of that part... <br>
<br>
&gt; You are straw manning me about Stalin. <br>
<br>
How? You claimed a mass murdering communist did more good than JFK. There's really nothing more to be said, you're just back pedaling at this point. <br>
<br>
&gt; And your argument is no different than the Qult. Even if Kennedy secretly hated the Jews (which he didn't) it doesn't matter when he did everything they wanted.<br>
<br>
Why are you stuck on the Q shit? I'd really like to know. You're the one having to ignore facts to maintain a narrative.</div>

<br>
Yes Stalin was, it was something like 1/4 jew on his grandfathers side. They hide this fact so no one can claim communism is pure Jewish. Those clothes are Khazakstanian or something similar, but he's standing next to a self admitted jew and looks identical. <br>
<br>
Trump is a shabbos goy as his kids married jews. Not even Stalin was at the wailing wall. <br>
<br>
He made antisemitism punishable by death in the first place, this is not absolved by undoing it later. He only undid it to consolidate power under the guise of nationalism. Even Hitler stated he admired him because he thinks in centuries. We never seem to focus on his mass murder of white Christians in the meantime though.
</div></blockquote>

That was Lenin. We don't know who Stalin's father was and his mother being jewish was speculation. Here's a theory. What if Stalin's mom gave him the name "jewson" to get the kikes to pay for his education? It's just as valid as that other guy's. And we still have the point that he turned on the jews and removed them from power and removed those laws that protected them. Why would a jew do that? Why would a jew cut his own throat and betray the tribe for no reason?<br>
<br>
All his mass murder and pro-jew laws were probably done by jews with Stalin's forced ok. Lots of people have done horrible shit on the jews' say so and most of them were forced to do it. Why does that explanation not apply to Stalin? Why does it all rest on his head when we know the jews were in power and had a lot of pull? It's the same thing with T-Bitty's Kennedy bullshit. It's all Kennedy's fault,ignore the jews.<br>
<br>
Don't be like T-Bitty.
</div></blockquote>

Right back at ya, Stalin was Jewish just like Lenin. Let's not dismiss facts here. <br>
<br>
Just as Putin's Jewishness was nearly covered up even in our time today of never before freedom of information due to the world wide web. That shows the level of effort this took. The old Soviet regime removed and rewrote history. To the point after high ranking party members would be purged on Stalin's orders. After this, the propaganda machine would literally take images of Stalin and those purged and remove the purged from the photo's removing the previous from distribution in society. Then they never existed.<br>
<br>
Just like Putin there is virtual almost nothing about Stalin's origins or life at all. Which is a cover up. With a phoney small white washed history of Stalin put in later on to make him a Hero to his subjects. Its the same with Mao which is very suspicious as well. As the Jews created, built and still run Communist China:<br>
topic9078.html<br>
<br>
Remember the Jews tried to hide Lenin's Jewishness along with Trotsky's and numerous others of them. But the lying you know....just stopped at Stalin.....Since the Jews where lying about Lenin, Trotsky, Beria and the rest, they are lying about Stalin today as well.<br>
<br>
Some things can't lie, as Stalin's strange condition with his arm. Which he told numerous lies his whole life over. Why? Because for Jews in the Eastern regions he was from. His arm was a common genetic defect. Like tay-sachs disease which only effects Jews [which shows their a racial group. This is common to Jews. Stalin also had another birth defect on two interconnected toes on his feet [which he lied to cover up again]which is common to Jews.<br>
<br>
Stalin's place of birth Gori was the home of the largest Georgian Jewish population of the time. With Jewish groups such as the Lezgishvili branch of Jews being one of the largest ones in Georgia. Something to highlight is the surname of Stalin:<br>
<br>
Maurice Pinay wrote based off what Eastern Europeans had told him who escaped the Red Terror:<br>
<br>
"In the Georgian language “shvili” means son of, or son, as in Johnson. “Djuda” means Jew. therefore Djugashvili means Jewison… Or Joe Jewison." [1]<br>
<br>
With this...<br>
<br>
"In the Georgian language “shvili” means son of, or son, as in Johnson. “Djuda” means Jew. therefore Djugashvili means Jewison… Or Joe Jewison." As will be explained Juda, Iuda is the word for Jew in Georgia. Because this is the Jews word for themselves in all languages. <br>
<br>
Note the mention of Iranian origin:<br>
<br>
Stalin's surname is mentioned by Buachidze to have possible Persian origins over Georgian surnames:<br>
"Genetic studies carried out on Georgian Jews as part of a wider survey showed close genetic links with other Jews, and in particular with Iraqi and Persian Jews. This seemed to prove the historical accounts of Jewish migration from Persia into Georgia."[2]<br>
<br>
There are Jews in the Caucuses who claim Persian origin. One of the largest Jewish communities in central Asia is the Bukharian Jews who speak a Persian based language and stated they came from Persia. Among their surnames there are very similar ones in meaning to Stalin's. Such as Yuda-kov.<br>
<br>
‘Stalin's childhood origins were supposedly Georgian, but the truth is his mother was Ossete, from the Khazarian region." Khazaria was the original home of the Jews in Eastern Europe most of the Ashkenazi Jews are Kharazian. Unlike like bogus claims put forth by a certain Jew. Morden genetic tests show the Jews of Kharazian region are racial Jews and not converts. <br>
<br>
However Djuga within Georgian has been contested in this meaning by others. But its claimed mainstream meaning of "Steele" is also contested by Georgian writers such as Kita Buachidze. There is a lot of disagreement. The confusion is because this surname is not found as its claimed within the region. Juda- Iuda/iudeveli/iudeuri is Judah, Juda, judaic in Georgian. . Making Jugashvili a Georgian way to state Judah/Juda of which the word Jew is from and used as one in the same within this context. Note the J and I are interchangeable here within Gregorian.<br>
<br>
Djuga Jugashvili ~ Judashvili ~ Juda-son, Dzhugashvili ~ Juda-son.<br>
<br>
The “d” and “zh are simply used for the J sound in Russian. Dzh is simply the J sound.<br>
<br>
"In the Georgian language “shvili” means son of, or son, as in Johnson. “Djuda” means Jew. therefore Djugashvili means Jewison… Or Joe Jewison." D and J are the same. Once again Juda like the surname Yuda of the Jews in the central Asia region which the genetic test show the Georgian Jews are from. Such as the Bukharian Jewish community.<br>
<br>
People where looking at Evrei and ebraeli which are Georgian derivatives of Hebrew only, not the separate word, Judah/Juda. This was the mistake in claiming this surname didn't mean Son of a Jew. Based on the separate words of Hebrew only not Judah. Of course the sources I found that made this bogus claim based on such incorrect terms was from an obvious Jew or people repeating the narrative the Jews themselves created in their USSR. Big surprise. The other word they state for Jew in Georgian "Uriah" is derogatory term like Kike. How many Jews are walking around with the name Kikeson. None, Judah, Juda, Yuda, Yehudi are the universal terms the Jews use from themselves as a nation in all languages from Central Asia to the West.<br>
<br>
His Father was a Jew.<br>
<br>
This is the real source meaning of what Pinay reasoned out from what he was told by Eastern Europeans, <br>
<br>
This is why Stalin changed his surname from the original, just to cover this over. If it really was just Steele in Georgian there was no need to change it. <br>
<br>
I note Stalin's mother was from the peasant class of which the large majority of Georgian Jews where within. The other group of Georgian Jews where rich Jewish rug merchants of which Stalin's mother...."Keke often worked in the houses of rich Jewish traders in Gori, and sometimes took her son along."[2]<br>
It was these wealthy Jews who actually paid for Stalin's education as a young man. Which is a common custom for Jews in the Georgian community to provide educational support to the Jewish youth of their community. And Stalin had the mind for such. Stalin's mother Ekaterina did laundry and housekeeping for David Papisnedov, a local Jew. Their nickname for Stalin was "Soso". Stalin received Papisnedov at the Kremlin often. It has been believed with great case that the Jew Papisnedov was in fact Stalin's father by some. One way or another his father was a Jew and probably his mother a Khazar Jew too.<br>
<br>
Stalin also made anti-Semitism the death penalty in the USSR and was behind the creation of Israel sending the Jewish NKVD down to help along with money and supplies and was also the first world leader to recognize, Israel as the Jewish State in the UN.<br>
<br>
In 1931 Soviet Dictator Josef Stalin told the Jewish News Agency in the United States that: <br>
<br>
“Under USSR law active anti-Semites are liable to the death penalty!”<br>
<br>
This move was also to protect the members of the ruling regime from being exposed as Jews. As this was officially hidden. Doing so was the death penalty. <br>
<br>
Stalin spent his career violently liquating all nationalist sentiment from within the Soviet Union. Millions of Ukrainian Nationalist alone went to the death camps of the Gulag to never return along with millions others before firing squads. But then Stalin just turns around and gives the Jews their own Nationalist region within the USSR and later green lighted the creation of Israel.<br>
<br>
May 7, 1934, Stalin created the Jewish state of Birobidjan (or Birobidzhan) in Russia. Birobidjan was the first territorial-administrative entity in the world designated for the Jewish people on the basis of their Jewish nationality. It was located on the border of Russia and China.<br>
<br>
Stalin is the perfect example of how Jewish Christianity and Communism work together. He officially reopened the Orthodox Church to build a propaganda base to enforce the Soviet State during the war. They simply put KGB agents in the top ranks of the Clergy. The old Churches and Clergy where liquidated for being a Pro Czarist element along with millions of normal people. Nothing else. The church minted thousands of Icon's showing Stalin as a Saint.<br>
<br>
Putin's regimes, key intellectual and philosopher is this Communist creep, Dugin. Who believes that STALINIST North Korea is the ideal society. And praises the Kim's. <br>
<br>
Its worth noting what Dugin openly admits in a interview he did back in 2012:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/07" class="postlink">http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/07</a> ... der-dugin/<br>
"This fits well with the Orthodox critique of Western Christianity. It is easy to see that the secularization of Western Christianity gives us liberalism. The secularization of the Orthodox religion gives us Communism......"<br>
<br>
Now its no mistake why the Jewish Putin's regime pushes both Stalinism and Orthodox Christianity. Two sides of the same Jewish coin.<br>
<br>
The Jews in their writings state Christians are their slaves and soldiers. <br>
<br>
A lot has been done to cover over Stalin's Jewishness and the Jews have pushed all kinds of misinformation of the subject. Because they obviously know what it would mean today if Stalin's Jewishness was well known. They also tried to cover over another Georgian Jew as mentioned the close friend of Stalin, Beria. Beria is a deviate of the Jewish surname Bar.<br>
<br>
Lets look at what the Jews themselves where saying back when Stalin was still cool old "Uncle Joe our ally!" to the Western world...<br>
<br>
David Weissman, in an article in the B'NAI B'RITH MESSENGER (Mar. 3, 1950), stated that Stalin is a Jew. Stalin spoke Yiddish, &amp; had three Jewish wives,<br>
<br>
The Jewish writer Louis Levine, in SOVIET RUSSIA TODAY (Nov. 1946) wrote: "Stalin &amp; the father of his Jewish son-in-law drank Lachaim together in the Kremlin." <br>
<br>
Stalin's Jewish background was mentioned in Los Angeles B'nai B'rith Messenger, March 3, 1950, col. 2, p. 5. <br>
<br>
A columnist in the Los Angeles B'nai B'rith Messenger, March 3, 1950, col. 2, p. 5 wrote: "A former Soviet general claims that Joseph Stalin is of Jewish ancestry." Many White Russians who fled the Bolsheviks say Stalin was a Jew. One, a captain in the Czar's armies, stated that he knew Stalin in their boyhood and that Stalin's father (Djugashvili) was "a Jewish cobbler <br>
<br>
" Lots of sources describe Beria as a Jew, and state, he was talking Yiddish with Stalin's children."[3]<br>
<br>
Makes sense since Stalin spoke Yiddish and was married to Jewesses who spoke the same. That Jewish Beria would communicate with Stalin's children in Yiddish as well.<br>
<br>
Stalin frequently attended the Yiddish theater as well. <br>
<br>
"In 1921 the GOSET troupe moved into a theater less than a mile from the Kremlin. For 28 years, through purge, terror, and paranoia, they presented world-class theater in Yiddish."[4]<br>
<br>
This makes sense as the top People in Moscow where Jews who could also speak Yiddish.<br>
<br>
Stalin his wife and children and even Beria where sitting around the dinner table speaking Yiddish with each other.<br>
<br>
Stalin's oldest son Yakov married another Jew, Yulia Meltzer, a well-known Jewish dancer from Odessa who was formerly married to a NKVD officer.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Stalin's Jewish wives. [my note remember the one Jewish reported pointed out Stalin's...."Jewish brother in law...Meaning a Jewish wife."]<br>
<br>

<br>
The first was Ekaterina Svanidze who bore him one son, Jacob. His second wife was Kadya Allevijah. She bore him a son Vassili, and a daughter Svetlana. His second wife died in mysterious circumstances, either by committing suicide, or murdered by Stalin. His third wife was Rosa Kaganovich, the sister of Lazar Kaganovich, who was the head of Soviet industry. <br>
<br>
Stalin's daughter (who in 1967 fled to the USA) then married Lazar's son Mihail i.e. her step-mother's nephew. Svetlana Stalin had a total of four husbands, three of them Jewish. <br>
<br>
Stalin's vice-president Molotov was also married to a Jewess, whose brother, Sam Karp, runs an export business in Connecticut. Just to complicate things even more, the Molotov's (half-Jewish) daughter also called Svetlana was engaged to be married to Stalin's son Vassili. [5]<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Stuart Kahan states in his book The Wolf of the Kremlin that Rosa Kaganovich, sister of Lazar Kaganovich, was Stalin's third wife.<br>
<br>
Now with all the above and below we are supposed to buy that everyone around Stalin was Jewish even his wives and children......But not Stalin. Why? Because the lying Jooz today say so.<br>
<br>
Harold Wallace Rosenthal was a senior aide to then-Senator Jacob K. Javits when Rosenthal was murdered in a terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turkey which many believe was a Mossad hit for his revealing too much about the Jewish agenda.<br>
<br>
Rosenthal stated:<br>
<br>
"When asked why Jews frequently change their names he said: "Jews are the most intelligent people in the world, so if it benefits them to change their name they do so. That's all there is to it. They mix in your society which is plenty corrupt, so while the Jews are benefiting themselves the dumb goy doesn't realize that these Jews with non-Jew names are Jews. <br>
<br>
I know what you are thinking about Jews in government who use non-Jew names. Well don't be concerned because in the foreseeable future there will be no Presidential power in the United States. The invisible government is taking strength in that direction." <br>
<br>
"Most Jews throughout the world, I'd say more than 90%, know what is really happening to our people. We have communication unequalled anywhere. It is only the jerks, the ignorant and misinformed and degenerates who can find peace in your society and you bastards hide your sins by donning sheep's clothing. You are the hypocrites not the Jews, as you say and write about."<br>
<br>
"To answer your question, in Russia, there are two distinct governments, one visible and the other invisible. The visible is made up of different nationalities, whereas the invisible is composed of ALL JEWS. The powerful Soviet Secret Police takes its orders from the invisible government. There are about six to seven million Communist in Soviet Russia, 50% are Jews and 50% are gentiles, but the gentiles are not trusted. The Communist Jews are united and trust each other, while the others spy on one another. About every five to six years the secret Jewish Board calls for the purge of the party and many are liquidated."<br>
<br>
When asked why, Mr. Rosenthal replied, "Because they begin to understand too much about the Jewish secret government. Russian Communists have a Secret Group Order which consists of Jews only. They rule over everything pertaining to the visible government. It was this powerful organization that was responsible for the secret removal of the center of Communism to Tel Aviv from where all instructions now originate ... the invisible rulers in the Communist countries have a world control over the propaganda and the governments in free countries. We control every media of expression including newspapers, magazines, radio and television. Even your music! We censor the songs released for publication long before they reach the publishers. Before long we will have complete control of your thinking."<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/2irndh.JPG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Can we draw from this the conclusion that Stalin's government has shaken itself free of Jewish control and has become a National Government? Certainly no opinion could be more erroneous or more dangerous than that...<br>
The Jews are yielding ground at some points and are sacrificing certain lives, in the hope that by clever arrangements they may succeed in saving their threatened power. They still have in their hands the principal levers of control. The day they will be obliged to give them up the Marxist edifice will collapse like a house of cards.<br>
<br>
To prove that, though Jewish domination is gravely compromised, the Jews are still in control, we have only to take the list of the highly placed officials of the Red State. The two brothers-in-law of Stalin, Lazarus and Moses Kaganovitch, are ministers of Transport and of Industry, respectively; Litvinoff (Wallach-Jeyer- Finkelstein) still directs the foreign policy of the Soviet Union...The post of ambassador at Paris is entrusted to the Jew, Louritz, in place of the Russian, Potemkine, who has been recalled to Moscow. If the ambassador of the U.S.S.R. in London, the Jew Maiski, seems to have fallen into disgrace, it is his fellow-Jew, Samuel Kagan, who represents U.S.S.R. on the London Non-Intervention Committee. A Jew named Yureneff (Gofmann) is the ambassador of the U.S.S.R. at Berlin...Since the beginning of the discontent in the Red Army the guard of the Kremlin and the responsibility for Stalin's personal safety is confided to the Jewish colonel, Jacob Rapaport.<br>
<br>
All the internment camps, with their population of seven million Russians, are in charge of the Jew, Mendel Kermann, aided by the Jews, Lazarus Kagan and Semen Firkin. All the prisons of the country, filled with working men and peasants, are governed by the Jew, Kairn Apeter. The News-Agency and the whole Press of the country are controlled by the Jews...The clever system of double control, organized by the late Jankel Gamarnik, head of the political staff of the army, is still functioning, so far as we can discover. I have before me the list of these highly placed Jews, more powerful than the Bluchers and the Egonoffs, to whom the European Press so often alludes. Thus the Jew, Aronchtam, whose name is never mentioned, is the Political Commissar of the Army in the Far East: the Jew Rabinovitch is the Political Commissar of the Baltic Fleet, etc.<br>
<br>
All this goes to prove that Stalin's government, in spite of all its attempts at camouflage, has never been, and will never be, a national government. Israel will always be the controlling power and driving force behind it. Those who do not see that the Soviet Union is not Russian must be blind."<br>
<br>
The Rulers of Russia, Denis Fahey, pp. 40-42)<br>
<br>
Sometimes the Jews just can't hide their race no matter how they try. Take the Jew Sasha Cohen give a standard hair style and moustache of the Eastern regions of the day and........<br>

&gt; Yes I'm clearly a Jew despite everything I've said showing I'm not. <br>
<br>
I never said you were a jew, I said you argue like one. That and your deflecting away from Jewish ethnicity was rather suspect given that you were trying to praise his anti Jewish actions. <br>
<br>
&gt; I never used Ruqqus, because as you say it's run by Jews, but is this how you argue? Drop a claim without evidence then call everyone who questions it a Jew?<br>
<br>
More lies, that's not what I did and you blatantly ignored my evidence and proof. I'm all for public debate and presentation of facts, but you're clearly trying to move the goalposts by dismissing facts that don't support your claims. Like JFK ordering the troops back from Vietnam. You conveniently forgot to acknowledge that proof and moved onto the next topic. <br>
<br>
&gt;  More evidence of you arguing like a Qultist, and it sounds like you're doing more harm if that's the case.<br>
<br>
You seem to be stuck in the Q mindset, I wonder why that would be. <br>
<br>
&gt; You understand I am talking about Lee Harvey Oswald, not Stalin right?<br>
<br>
You didn't specify and your format makes it confusing as to which point you're addressing. Oswald wasn't himself Jewish, he was indoctrinated into their communist clutches by the age of 14 while growing up in the jew infested Bronx, we covered this. <br>
<br>
&gt; So Ted Kennedy drowned his mistress, and his family seemed not to care. Imagine what point you have to be at to more or less brush that off.<br>
Okay but said group contained people who would be unlikely to make it up.<br>
<br>
Ted Kennedy did not drown her, he crashed the car that ended up in the water. His negligent driving killed her. He didn't hold her head under the water. Let's not mince words here. They're corrupt enough without having to dramatize it. <br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah why don't you read that whole thread genius. Clearly I hate FDR but I put somethings blamed on him on Truman and Churchill. More land = Silesia and Pomerania. You literally read it. Yeah Tallest who usually agrees with me and I with him totally destroyed me by seemingly agreeing with me after I explained my points, if it makes you feel better. Now please explain your flip flopping on FDR.<br>
<br>
He destroyed your logic, and I never saw him agree with your original point. I never flipped on FDR the guy was a kike. Case in point: <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/uzkfsz.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br>
<br>
He was the one that stole our gold. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/n5fdnm.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
On top of that, he changed the US Seal <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/sphap3.JPG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> and redesigned the $1 bill from this <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/rex0vc.JPG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> to the current version that reflects the Star of David. <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/bjuidb.JPG" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br>
<br>
Yet he ranks higher than JFK in your book... <br>
<br>
&gt; Because you made a false claim about Kennedy trying to end the Fed when he asked Congress to support it and get rid of the silver standard, and claimed Jews killed him without proof. Frankly this should have been dispelled with my first or second response. Here's to 100 though.<br>
<br>
Running in circles you are. You never proved anything beyond vague interpretations that he was supporting the fed and Israel. I did prove jews killed him because they were stalking him even in Cuba. I told you of the float that Castro made in his Hate America parade depicting JFK in a coffin weeks before his assassination. But it's more fun to ignore said evidence and act like your assertions were all correct as if nothing happened. <br>
<br>
&gt; I did. Judges who were friends with Kennedy and LBJ ruled there was voter fraud in favor of them, but not enough to sway an election. Texas didn't allow for recounts either. Plus we do know Nixon won the popular vote. All put together it's incredibly unlikely he lost.<br>
<br>
Popular vote &lt; Electoral College <br>
<br>
Popular vote means shit. If we went strictly by popular vote, the only deciders for leaders would be NY, California, Chicago, and Florida. <br>
<br>
&gt; The question is about Oswald being Jewish, not Stalin. Although I did say he was Georgian. I'm waiting for proof Oswald was Jewish. <br>
<br>
You're deflecting, I never said he was Jewish and you did say Stalin was Georgian, which he was. How the fuck would I think you were talking about Oswald there? Stalin was Jewish, not Oswald. <br>
<br>
&gt; You agreed the FBI was likely trustworthy at the time.<br>
<br>
&gt; Nigga what you think this is Plebbit? Everyone here knows Stalin is a mass murderer. I need not explain that here, plus that was initially to address one of merlynn's points who brought him up.<br>
<br>
You ask if this is plebbit then talk like a nigger. You hold him in a higher regard than JFK. That's the hang up. <br>
<br>
&gt; I don't know what IIRC means and I don't follow your point here.<br>
<br>
If I Recall Correctly, because I wasn't going searching for it. <br>
<br>
&gt; Yet you haven't proven they killed him. And if they did that doesn't mean he was anti Jewish/pro American.<br>
<br>
I love your little escape pod you create lol. I did prove it, but you claimed I didn't. Just in case I do though, you insert a "that's not why" ahead of time? Kek <br>
<br>
&gt; I've been more polite than you. Absolutely, merlynn talks shit (as he does to everyone) I reply with shit, I see no problem there. If I recall you liked his post when he first went schizo and started name calling and lying about what my sources said.<br>
<br>
I also liked your posts rebutting him, but no mention of that part... <br>
<br>
&gt; You are straw manning me about Stalin. <br>
<br>
How? You claimed a mass murdering communist did more good than JFK. There's really nothing more to be said, you're just back pedaling at this point. <br>
<br>
&gt; And your argument is no different than the Qult. Even if Kennedy secretly hated the Jews (which he didn't) it doesn't matter when he did everything they wanted.<br>
<br>
Why are you stuck on the Q shit? I'd really like to know. You're the one having to ignore facts to maintain a narrative.
</div></blockquote>
Because I was unaware of Stalin's potential Jewish ancestry.<br>
<br>
It's what you did for the most part.<br>
Shit I think I did forget to acknowledge that, my bad. Yeah it really was just a slip up. I don't trust McNamara so I want the official order still. I meant to write that the last time. I kinda flew by. In my defense you too have missed or mixed up points.<br>
<br>
Because your argument about JFK being /our guy/ is the same as theirs for Trump. No need to wonder, I said this.<br>
<br>
He liked my response explaining it. I can't claim to read his mind though, you can ask him what he thinks if you're so griped by it. Yes, as stated I considered moving him lower but the rest sucked below him so I decided not to go back to change it (it took forever to make the list). The big plus FDR has is that he isn't a false icon of the right. Our worthless currency happened in three parts: FDR made it so American citizens couldn't use gold, JFK made it so we have to use worthless Fed notes, on a bittersweet note Nixon made it so foreign countries couldn't use our gold.<br>
<br>
I literally linked his congressional testimony on the fed, his campaign ad and giving our weapons to Israel seems pretty sufficient. And no, as stated I do not believe a communist retard killing him is the same as Jews killing him. Of course Castro did that, he and Kennedy aren't known for their warm relationship.<br>
<br>
It's rare the popular vote loses, especially with the other factors.<br>
<br>
I mean I think I clearly asked for proof on Oswald, my bad if it wasn't.<br>
<br>
I'm inclined to stand by it. I prefer an objective terrible over a false icon. But as stated its a tight race for the bottom.<br>
<br>
You haven't. You have at most concluded that communists killed Kennedy, which I can believe. As stated I don't consider all communists Jewish, despite following a terrible Jewish ideology. For example several Arab and African countries were communist despite opposing Israel and Jews. And yes, the Jews have no problem offing a puppet, it is not necessarily a sign of anything else. Isn't that your argument about Stalin? A puppet to the end? Well you claim he was also Jewish I suppose.<br>
<br>
Because you liked his at the beginning.<br>
<br>
I claimed a mass murdering communist did more against Jews than JFK, as it is true. That doesn't mean Stalin was anti Jewish overall though. I assume like Chappaquiddick you're unaware of the doctor's plot (warning, channel is not my favorite and is comically wrong about certain things like muh Hololocaust, this video may even be wrong, I just wanted a quick introduction): <a href="https://youtu.be/DeHsKoS9ssU" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/DeHsKoS9ssU</a><br>
But if you want me to vocalize Stalin was a bad dude, he was a bad dude. He killed roughly 20 million people deliberately. JFK despite his faults did not. Happy? At no point did I say I liked Stalin so you have been straw manning me.<br>
<br>
Shall I reiterate then? Your argument is that despite JFK's pro Jew words, actions, and brothers (which I have provided first hand sources for without a doubt), he was secretly our guy and that he wasn't discarded as a puppet because Jews believe they can do whatever they want or because they weren't directly involved, but because he was super secretly against them. It's almost the same as the Q argument.<br>
<br>
My bad if I missed something, it's not intentional. If you remind me I'll address it.</div>

			<div class="content">Lmao fuck both of you, don't be like T-bitty and what? Actually see what these goons said and did? I'll comment on your Stalin discussion though. I was unaware of Stalin possibly being Jewish before this discussion, as Wikipedia provides a thorough early life section on him that makes no mention of it. However him growing up in a Jewish region and dressing like a Jew with an originally Jewish last name is pretty damming. However merlynn's only good point is why would Stalin so comically cut his own throat then? We do have evidence of it unlike for JFK. Irregardless he still killed 20 million people, or at the very least did nothing to prevent it, turning on the Jews afterwards seems a little late to be praiseworthy.</div>

Lmao fuck both of you, don't be like T-bitty and what? Actually see what these goons said and did? I'll comment on your Stalin discussion though. I was unaware of Stalin possibly being Jewish before this discussion, as Wikipedia provides a thorough early life section on him that makes no mention of it. However him growing up in a Jewish region and dressing like a Jew with an originally Jewish last name is pretty damming. However merlynn's only good point is why would Stalin so comically cut his own throat then? We do have evidence of it unlike for JFK. Irregardless he still killed 20 million people, or at the very least did nothing to prevent it, turning on the Jews afterwards seems a little late to be praiseworthy.

I already said why, scroll back and read.
</div></blockquote>

I did. It just made a claim that Stalin didn't get rid of all the jews,which is obvious,it didn't say why he turned against them in the first place. Unless you're saying he wasn't jewish. Cause that was the only explanation there was. Non-jews turn against the secret jewish government as they learn more about it. That doesn't explain why a jew would do it. Stalin purged jews. This thing explains why jews purge non-jews from government. Not why a jew would turn against his fellow jews.<br>
<br>
So is Stalin a jew or not?</div>

I already said why, scroll back and read.
</div></blockquote>

I did. It just made a claim that Stalin didn't get rid of all the jews,which is obvious,it didn't say why he turned against them in the first place. Unless you're saying he wasn't jewish. Cause that was the only explanation there was. Non-jews turn against the secret jewish government as they learn more about it. That doesn't explain why a jew would do it. Stalin purged jews. This thing explains why jews purge non-jews from government. Not why a jew would turn against his fellow jews.<br>
<br>
So is Stalin a jew or not?
</div></blockquote>
No you didn't, because I already covered consolidation of power. Stalin was a jew. Look up the term Shoah.</div>

No one said he didn't work for the jews. The point is he hated them. Why is that so hard for you to understand?
</div></blockquote>
Because no one has proven that he hated Jews.

No one has proven he was worse than a communist murderer, either.

Lmao fuck both of you, don't be like T-bitty and what? Actually see what these goons said and did? I'll comment on your Stalin discussion though. I was unaware of Stalin possibly being Jewish before this discussion, as Wikipedia provides a thorough early life section on him that makes no mention of it. However him growing up in a Jewish region and dressing like a Jew with an originally Jewish last name is pretty damming. However merlynn's only good point is why would Stalin so comically cut his own throat then? We do have evidence of it unlike for JFK. Irregardless he still killed 20 million people, or at the very least did nothing to prevent it, turning on the Jews afterwards seems a little late to be praiseworthy.
</div></blockquote>

&gt; using the word "irregardless"
</div></blockquote>
&gt; needlessly complaining about a real word<br>
<br>
So in conclusion Kennedy was a fag
</div></blockquote>

I suppose you also say "dethawed". <br>
<br>
In conclusion, you favor a genocidal communist over a US President.</div>

&gt; using the word "irregardless"
</div></blockquote>
&gt; needlessly complaining about a real word<br>
<br>
So in conclusion Kennedy was a fag
</div></blockquote>

I suppose you also say "dethawed". <br>
<br>
In conclusion, you favor a genocidal communist over a US President.
</div></blockquote>
Why shouldn't I? Both are words that are easily understood.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, you're too vain to be reasoned with, you likely have turned more people away from the truth on Hitler than towards him with your Qtard debate skills. You know I don't believe that so you are a liar.</div>

No you didn't, because I already covered consolidation of power. Stalin was a jew. Look up the term Shoah.
</div></blockquote>

China consolidated power without purging jews. Every communist country consolidates power without purging jews. Why was it necessary in Russia for a jew to purge his fellow jews? To remove protections for jews? To target,specifically,jews? That's not consolidating power for the jews. That's taking power from the jews.</div>

Except they did kick their jews out, then they became nationalists. The jew wormed its way back in though by promising to get them to be the next superpower and giving them US industry.</div>

&gt; needlessly complaining about a real word<br>
<br>
So in conclusion Kennedy was a fag
</div></blockquote>

I suppose you also say "dethawed". <br>
<br>
In conclusion, you favor a genocidal communist over a US President.
</div></blockquote>
Why shouldn't I? Both are words that are easily understood.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, you're too vain to be reasoned with, you likely have turned more people away from the truth on Hitler than towards him with your Qtard debate skills. You know I don't believe that so you are a liar.
</div></blockquote>

<br>
Both are flawed. <br>
<br>
Your opinion is noted... Somewhere... I'm sure. Your ignorance to certain facts really paints a picture to why you keep mentioning the Q larp. Thank you for sliding my thread. Feel free to post your own endeavors of spreading truth, or whatever your isolated version of it is.</div>

Yes they are flawed because they're contradictory terms. You admitted you "forgot" to acknowledge all facts, but still maintain your narrative despite the facts contradicting it. The Q tard argument is that if you keep doing nothing, something or someone will save us from corruption. Thinking my debate style has any connection to that talking about past presidents that are long dead, is delusional at best and you're searching for a scapegoat to compare me to.</div>

<br>
Both are flawed. <br>
<br>
Your opinion is noted... Somewhere... I'm sure. Your ignorance to certain facts really paints a picture to why you keep mentioning the Q larp. Thank you for sliding my thread. Feel free to post your own endeavors of spreading truth, or whatever your isolated version of it is.
</div></blockquote>
No they're not, but I get it you're bent of shape and need to bitch about something.<br>
<br>
I acknowledged all facts, you didn't know basic facts about the subject. Your argument is the exact same as the Qtards.
</div></blockquote>

Yes they are flawed because they're contradictory terms. You admitted you "forgot" to acknowledge all facts, but still maintain your narrative despite the facts contradicting it. The Q tard argument is that if you keep doing nothing, something or someone will save us from corruption. Thinking my debate style has any connection to that talking about past presidents that are long dead, is delusional at best and you're searching for a scapegoat to compare me to.
</div></blockquote>
They're not, really bent about it huh? You got an English degree or something?<br>
I addressed it when reminded of it (plus the you didn't address my point about Vietnam how I asked you to, with the official order), meanwhile you missed some of my points and straw manned me.<br>
The Qtard argument is also that a man who served Jews his whole life was secretly thinking about betraying them despite doing nothing to suggest it, the same argument you use for JFK.</div>

No you didn't, you claimed MacNamara claimed it who said I didn't trust. Ah yes, I'll just do all the research myself to your points (I have any way and it shows you're wrong). "I'm not falling for the pilpul tactic of prove-it loops." You mean the tactic you used half this time? How is it you can describe how Jews debate and argue exactly how you describe? You seem rather hypocritical.<br>
<br>
Your argument is undeniably the exact same "muh pawn was secretly thinking about double crossing his masters despite doing nothing to show it [Insert no proof]". "Projection" is a fancy way of saying "no u" which shows you are childish and unoriginal on top of being vain and unknowledgeable about the subject.</div>

Yes I did. This is the prove it loop. "I don't trust that proof, give me more proof" repeated infinity. Straight out of the book of Marx. <br>
<br>
&gt; Ah yes, I'll just do all the research myself to your points (I have any way and it shows you're wrong). "I'm not falling for the pilpul tactic of prove-it loops." You mean the tactic you used half this time? How is it you can describe how Jews debate and argue exactly how you describe? You seem rather hypocritical.<br>
<br>
Well, perfect example is your lack of proof that Kennedy wanted to support the fed. He never came out and claimed anything, although his brother did. If you scrutinized your own sources like you did mine, you'd be demanding the same thing: more proof. <br>
<br>
Show me the actual order in which JFK stated specifically that we are to support Israel and jews. The sources you gave were heresay &amp; circumstantial at best. I want it quoted &amp; sourced. <br>
<br>
&gt; Your argument is undeniably the exact same "muh pawn was secretly thinking about double crossing his masters despite doing nothing to show it [Insert no proof]". <br>
<br>
Except the fact that he was withdrawing troops from Vietnam and they killed him. I guess that's not proof enough, either huh? <br>
<br>
&gt; "Projection" is a fancy way of saying "no u" which shows you are childish and unoriginal on top of being vain and unknowledgeable about the subject.<br>
<br>
Well, you're the one stuck on the Q shit and unable to solidify your points. You're the one lashing out emotionally when your points are challenged. You're the first to become disrespectful (self admittedly) citing disagreement as disrespectful...</div>

"I don't trust the direct quotes of women and Kennedy's staff!" "No you can't not trust MacNamara! Don't you know bureaucrats are super trustworthy?!"<br>
<br>
Lmao I literally linked you the speech he gave to Congress. Here it is again even though you won't read them:<br>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/HouseReportNo.183SilverLegislation" class="postlink">https://archive.org/details/HouseReport ... egislation</a><br>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/EconomicReportOfThePresidentJanuary1963/page/n21/mode/1up?view=theater" class="postlink">https://archive.org/details/EconomicRep ... ew=theater</a><br>
<a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-q8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2964,4612588" class="postlink">https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=- ... 64,4612588</a><br>
Maybe if you read my sources you'd know this already. It is a full fledged lie Kennedy opposed the Fed which I proved beyond a doubt from the start.<br>
<br>
He sent them our weapons, and allowed his campaign to say Jews had a right to Israel, I sent you links on them before. No point in sending them again because you either don't read them or deny facts. Also you refused to give me substantial evidence for any of your claims except Stalin being Jewish.<br>
<br>
No you claiming Kennedy reversed his decision on sending troops to Vietnam is not enough evidence. When I called you out you looked it up and choose the very first source, which I do not trust, you searched further when I pressed you but that's the only source that claims it. I know because I looked it up.<br>
<br>
So you call me delusional (or some variety of it), claim I argue like a Jew (when you act exactly how you described them), you straw man me and claim I love FDR after I asked why you claimed he was the most anti Semitic president after claiming he was Jewish as though I forgot and you straw manned me for addressing one of Merlynn's points on Stalin, then you try to end the argument by bitching about grammar. I was not rude first, I asked you to stop being rude but said since you started I might return it, and when I saw "the guy who's every action supported Jews was secretly the next Hitler, even though Hitler was honest and wouldn't try to be secretive" I couldn't help but laugh. And because you're so vain you can't see how stupid it is to claim JFK was anything other than an anti white degenerate, it's the exact same argument as "muh savior Trump." You know it is but you'd rather double down then consider you could ever be wrong.<br>
<br>
If you weren't right about Hitler and Trump I'd have to assume the worst about you, instead I'm left knowing you are too vain to debate with. It must have been dumb luck you figured those two out because it clearly wasn't research.</div>

&gt; No you didn't, you claimed MacNamara claimed it who said I didn't trust.<br>
<br>
Yes I did. This is the prove it loop. "I don't trust that proof, give me more proof" repeated infinity. Straight out of the book of Marx. <br>
<br>
&gt; Ah yes, I'll just do all the research myself to your points (I have any way and it shows you're wrong). "I'm not falling for the pilpul tactic of prove-it loops." You mean the tactic you used half this time? How is it you can describe how Jews debate and argue exactly how you describe? You seem rather hypocritical.<br>
<br>
Well, perfect example is your lack of proof that Kennedy wanted to support the fed. He never came out and claimed anything, although his brother did. If you scrutinized your own sources like you did mine, you'd be demanding the same thing: more proof. <br>
<br>
Show me the actual order in which JFK stated specifically that we are to support Israel and jews. The sources you gave were heresay &amp; circumstantial at best. I want it quoted &amp; sourced. <br>
<br>
&gt; Your argument is undeniably the exact same "muh pawn was secretly thinking about double crossing his masters despite doing nothing to show it [Insert no proof]". <br>
<br>
Except the fact that he was withdrawing troops from Vietnam and they killed him. I guess that's not proof enough, either huh? <br>
<br>
&gt; "Projection" is a fancy way of saying "no u" which shows you are childish and unoriginal on top of being vain and unknowledgeable about the subject.<br>
<br>
Well, you're the one stuck on the Q shit and unable to solidify your points. You're the one lashing out emotionally when your points are challenged. You're the first to become disrespectful (self admittedly) citing disagreement as disrespectful...
</div></blockquote>
"I don't trust the direct quotes of women and Kennedy's staff!" "No you can't not trust MacNamara! Don't you know bureaucrats are super trustworthy?!"<br>
<br>
Lmao I literally linked you the speech he gave to Congress. Here it is again even though you won't read them:<br>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/HouseReportNo.183SilverLegislation" class="postlink">https://archive.org/details/HouseReport ... egislation</a><br>

Maybe if you read my sources you'd know this already. It is a full fledged lie Kennedy opposed the Fed which I proved beyond a doubt from the start.<br>
<br>
He sent them our weapons, and allowed his campaign to say Jews had a right to Israel, I sent you links on them before. No point in sending them again because you either don't read them or deny facts. Also you refused to give me substantial evidence for any of your claims except Stalin being Jewish.<br>
<br>
No you claiming Kennedy reversed his decision on sending troops to Vietnam is not enough evidence. When I called you out you looked it up and choose the very first source, which I do not trust, you searched further when I pressed you but that's the only source that claims it. I know because I looked it up.<br>
<br>
So you call me delusional (or some variety of it), claim I argue like a Jew (when you act exactly how you described them), you straw man me and claim I love FDR after I asked why you claimed he was the most anti Semitic president after claiming he was Jewish as though I forgot and you straw manned me for addressing one of Merlynn's points on Stalin, then you try to end the argument by bitching about grammar. I was not rude first, I asked you to stop being rude but said since you started I might return it, and when I saw "the guy who's every action supported Jews was secretly the next Hitler, even though Hitler was honest and wouldn't try to be secretive" I couldn't help but laugh. And because you're so vain you can't see how stupid it is to claim JFK was anything other than an anti white degenerate, it's the exact same argument as "muh savior Trump." You know it is but you'd rather double down then consider you could ever be wrong.<br>
<br>
If you weren't right about Hitler and Trump I'd have to assume the worst about you, instead I'm left knowing you are too vain to debate with. It must have been dumb luck you figured those two out because it clearly wasn't research.
</div></blockquote>

1. I said quote it. Source <strong class="text-strong">and quote</strong> it. From what I saw it's basically legalese gibberish that allowed for the possibility, not that he came right out and said they're our biggest ally or to the likes thereof. <br>
<br>
2. <blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also you refused to give me substantial evidence for any of your claims except Stalin being Jewish.</div></blockquote>

Yes I did. Fact denial right here after accusing me of the same. <br>
<br>
3. I sent you an article on it, it wasn't just my claim. If I were as petty as you I'd say prove he didn't. <br>
<br>
4. &gt; So you call me delusional (or some variety of it),<br>
<br>
When you can't prove your points, you speculate. I saw you do it with merlynn when you called him JIDF. There's no actual proof, just your assertion and we just have to take your word for it. Self reinforced delusion.<br>
<br>
&gt;  claim I argue like a Jew (when you act exactly how you described them), <br>
<br>
Amazing how you react to your own medicine, isn't it...<br>
<br>
&gt; you straw man me and claim I love FDR <br>
<br>
Link to where I ever said you loved him<br>
<br>
&gt; after I asked why you claimed he was the most anti Semitic president after claiming he was Jewish as though I forgot and you straw manned me for addressing one of Merlynn's points on Stalin, then you try to end the argument by bitching about grammar. <br>
<br>
Woah your horses there bud, take a breath. 1. I didn't make the claim, other people in office did, I just cited them. 2. He was both. 3. This whole straw man thing is beginning to look like the Q assertion. 4. Your grammar was offensibly terrible then you defended using it. It doesn't help you look more right by flubbing your words. <br>
<br>
&gt; I was not rude first, I asked you to stop being rude but said since you started I might return it, <br>
<br>
I asked what I did that was considered rude and you couldn't even give an example. Your claim is subjective and it would appear that you were emotionally triggered that someone dared disagree with you. I saw how fast your tact devolved in that merlynn episode, so I know you have it in you to trololol in a debate. There is no strawmanning here. <br>
<br>
&gt; and when I saw "the guy who's every action supported Jews was secretly the next Hitler, even though Hitler was honest and wouldn't try to be secretive" <br>
<br>
You're quoting shit that didn't happen, moving on... <br>
<br>

<br>
So you're going with an "I'm rubber, you're glue" stance? You haven't given a convincing example on this whole Q assertion, let alone proof, hence it's delusional to maintain that theory.</div>

1. Actions &gt; words<br>
<br>
2. You lie through your teeth. I await proof Jews killed Kennedy and await any instance of him acting against Jews.<br>
<br>
3. You sent the first article you found that says "MacNamara claimed..." When I specifically asked for the official order.<br>
<br>
4. I proved all my points despite the burden of proof being on you.<br>
Yes I called a Zionist a Jew, sorry not sorry.<br>
"Grrr! Tallest Skill destroyed you!" It was around there. Which you undoubtedly know.<br>
<br>
1. You didn't cite anyone by name. 2. The Jewish president was the most antisemitic? If that's what you're claiming you are as dumb as the qtards. 3. Be ALS, blatantly straw man opponent, feign ignorance. Really why do you argue how you described Jews to argue? 4. "Offensibly"<br>
<br>
I gave examples and you continued right away. Your dishonesty is beginning to dumbfound me. It's pretty just been us two, why are you trying to lie to me when you know i won't be convinced? Merlynn is only here to troll, I replied to him how he replied to me. You liked it when he first got rude and claimed my sources said things they didn't. I see how you get with others as well. Why act as though you're above it? Especially when you started it with me. Besides your dishonesty. You straw man like the devil and deny it in the next breathe, incredible.<br>
<br>
If you want an exact quote you're out of luck, but that is what you claimed. That JFK had an above zero chance of turning on his masters and that despite his dishonesty and lack of charisma he could have been the next Hitler.<br>
<br>
Come now, if you're going to try and troll me and lie to me at least use some original insults that don't boil down to "no u." I know you have them. Of do you only go for easy targets like Australians where the jokes write themselves? I explained it thoroughly why it's as crazy to think that your polio ridden gay ass Irish Catholic puppet was secretly considering betraying his masters as it is that Trump was going to.</div>

"I don't trust the direct quotes of women and Kennedy's staff!" "No you can't not trust MacNamara! Don't you know bureaucrats are super trustworthy?!"<br>
<br>
Lmao I literally linked you the speech he gave to Congress. Here it is again even though you won't read them:<br>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/HouseReportNo.183SilverLegislation" class="postlink">https://archive.org/details/HouseReport ... egislation</a><br>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/EconomicReportOfThePresidentJanuary1963/page/n21/mode/1up?view=theater" class="postlink">https://archive.org/details/EconomicRep ... ew=theater</a><br>
<a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-q8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2964,4612588" class="postlink">https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=- ... 64,4612588</a><br>
Maybe if you read my sources you'd know this already. It is a full fledged lie Kennedy opposed the Fed which I proved beyond a doubt from the start.<br>
<br>
He sent them our weapons, and allowed his campaign to say Jews had a right to Israel, I sent you links on them before. No point in sending them again because you either don't read them or deny facts. Also you refused to give me substantial evidence for any of your claims except Stalin being Jewish.<br>
<br>
No you claiming Kennedy reversed his decision on sending troops to Vietnam is not enough evidence. When I called you out you looked it up and choose the very first source, which I do not trust, you searched further when I pressed you but that's the only source that claims it. I know because I looked it up.<br>
<br>
So you call me delusional (or some variety of it), claim I argue like a Jew (when you act exactly how you described them), you straw man me and claim I love FDR after I asked why you claimed he was the most anti Semitic president after claiming he was Jewish as though I forgot and you straw manned me for addressing one of Merlynn's points on Stalin, then you try to end the argument by bitching about grammar. I was not rude first, I asked you to stop being rude but said since you started I might return it, and when I saw "the guy who's every action supported Jews was secretly the next Hitler, even though Hitler was honest and wouldn't try to be secretive" I couldn't help but laugh. And because you're so vain you can't see how stupid it is to claim JFK was anything other than an anti white degenerate, it's the exact same argument as "muh savior Trump." You know it is but you'd rather double down then consider you could ever be wrong.<br>
<br>
If you weren't right about Hitler and Trump I'd have to assume the worst about you, instead I'm left knowing you are too vain to debate with. It must have been dumb luck you figured those two out because it clearly wasn't research.
</div></blockquote>

1. I said quote it. Source <strong class="text-strong">and quote</strong> it. From what I saw it's basically legalese gibberish that allowed for the possibility, not that he came right out and said they're our biggest ally or to the likes thereof. <br>
<br>
2. <blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also you refused to give me substantial evidence for any of your claims except Stalin being Jewish.</div></blockquote>

Yes I did. Fact denial right here after accusing me of the same. <br>
<br>
3. I sent you an article on it, it wasn't just my claim. If I were as petty as you I'd say prove he didn't. <br>
<br>
4. &gt; So you call me delusional (or some variety of it),<br>
<br>
When you can't prove your points, you speculate. I saw you do it with merlynn when you called him JIDF. There's no actual proof, just your assertion and we just have to take your word for it. Self reinforced delusion.<br>
<br>
&gt;  claim I argue like a Jew (when you act exactly how you described them), <br>
<br>
Amazing how you react to your own medicine, isn't it...<br>
<br>
&gt; you straw man me and claim I love FDR <br>
<br>
Link to where I ever said you loved him<br>
<br>
&gt; after I asked why you claimed he was the most anti Semitic president after claiming he was Jewish as though I forgot and you straw manned me for addressing one of Merlynn's points on Stalin, then you try to end the argument by bitching about grammar. <br>
<br>
Woah your horses there bud, take a breath. 1. I didn't make the claim, other people in office did, I just cited them. 2. He was both. 3. This whole straw man thing is beginning to look like the Q assertion. 4. Your grammar was offensibly terrible then you defended using it. It doesn't help you look more right by flubbing your words. <br>
<br>
&gt; I was not rude first, I asked you to stop being rude but said since you started I might return it, <br>
<br>
I asked what I did that was considered rude and you couldn't even give an example. Your claim is subjective and it would appear that you were emotionally triggered that someone dared disagree with you. I saw how fast your tact devolved in that merlynn episode, so I know you have it in you to trololol in a debate. There is no strawmanning here. <br>
<br>
&gt; and when I saw "the guy who's every action supported Jews was secretly the next Hitler, even though Hitler was honest and wouldn't try to be secretive" <br>
<br>
You're quoting shit that didn't happen, moving on... <br>
<br>
&gt; I couldn't help but laugh. And because you're so vain you can't see how stupid it is to claim JFK was anything other than an anti white degenerate, it's the exact same argument as "muh savior Trump." You know it is but you'd rather double down then consider you could ever be wrong.<br>
<br>
So you're going with an "I'm rubber, you're glue" stance? You haven't given a convincing example on this whole Q assertion, let alone proof, hence it's delusional to maintain that theory.
</div></blockquote>
1. Actions &gt; words<br>
<br>
2. You lie through your teeth. I await proof Jews killed Kennedy and await any instance of him acting against Jews.<br>
<br>
3. You sent the first article you found that says "MacNamara claimed..." When I specifically asked for the official order.<br>
<br>
4. I proved all my points despite the burden of proof being on you.<br>
Yes I called a Zionist a Jew, sorry not sorry.<br>
"Grrr! Tallest Skill destroyed you!" It was around there. Which you undoubtedly know.<br>
<br>
1. You didn't cite anyone by name. 2. The Jewish president was the most antisemitic? If that's what you're claiming you are as dumb as the qtards. 3. Be ALS, blatantly straw man opponent, feign ignorance. Really why do you argue how you described Jews to argue? 4. "Offensibly"<br>
<br>
I gave examples and you continued right away. Your dishonesty is beginning to dumbfound me. It's pretty just been us two, why are you trying to lie to me when you know i won't be convinced? Merlynn is only here to troll, I replied to him how he replied to me. You liked it when he first got rude and claimed my sources said things they didn't. I see how you get with others as well. Why act as though you're above it? Especially when you started it with me. Besides your dishonesty. You straw man like the devil and deny it in the next breathe, incredible.<br>
<br>
If you want an exact quote you're out of luck, but that is what you claimed. That JFK had an above zero chance of turning on his masters and that despite his dishonesty and lack of charisma he could have been the next Hitler.<br>
<br>
Come now, if you're going to try and troll me and lie to me at least use some original insults that don't boil down to "no u." I know you have them. Of do you only go for easy targets like Australians where the jokes write themselves? I explained it thoroughly why it's as crazy to think that your polio ridden gay ass Irish Catholic puppet was secretly considering betraying his masters as it is that Trump was going to.
</div></blockquote>

You're really thirsty for a troll session, wow. Yeah, not interested. I told you where to go looking for that order. You refuse to do it. <br>
<br>
So in the meantime: <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The policies adopted in NSAM-263 were quickly overtaken by events. McNamara and Taylor's doubt that a successful coup d'etat would take place in South Vietnam proved mistaken when President Diem was overthrown and killed on 2 November. The coup was followed by Kennedy's assassination on November 22, and in December by a change of opinion by McNamara who came to the conclusion that "current trends [in South Vietnam], unless reversed in the next 2–3 months, will lead to neutralization at best and more likely to a Communist-controlled state."[11]<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the withdrawal of almost 1,000 U.S. military personnel from South Vietnam took place, albeit described by the Pentagon Papers as an "accounting exercise." The number of soldiers in South Vietnam was 16,752 in October and on December 31, was 15,894.[12]</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
First wave withdrew when he was killed.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Many historians, Kennedy acolytes, and celebrities, such as movie director Oliver Stone, have claimed that the withdrawal of 1,000 U.S. soldiers from Vietnam was the beginning of Kennedy's plan to withdraw completely from South Vietnam after he gained re-election in 1964 and cited NSAM-263 as evidence for that plan. Others, including Pulitzer Prize winning historian Fredrik Logevall, have said that "NSAM 263 hardly represented the kind of far-reaching policy initiative that the incipient-withdrawal proponents suggest. It was but one part of a larger 'selective pressures' policy designed to push the Diem regime into greater effectiveness." Logevall concluded that "The great preponderance of the evidence...would appear to refute any notion that John Kennedy had decided to withdraw from Vietnam." However, Logevall goes on to speculate that Kennedy, because of his character and personality, might have considered, at a later date, a unilateral withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam.[13]</div></blockquote></div>

Yeah I read your source, it's the first one to pop up showing you did no further research. No 1,000 troops is not evidence of a full reversal of Kennedy's original order and I still don't trust MacNamara. "Lol look up my claims," no. I didn't make you search even for obvious information like Chappaquiddick (which you probably live next to), it's your job to provide the proof for your claims. Aren't you Irishmen supposed to be the good journalists? Or did Jews completely replace you in that field? Like the Chinese did on the railroads and blacks did in complaining.

You tagged the wrong person @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=146629" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">T-bitty</a> <br>
<br>
You're the one misquoting and relying on delusion to ad hominem your adversary.
</div></blockquote>
You didn't meet your burden of proof when you made a far fetched claim (which under scrutiny is proven false instantly), didn't read my sources yet criticized them without providing your own, insulted me, straw manned me, and tried lying to me about the things you said. Or maybe you forgot, the Boston Red Sox lost, I imagine you about killed your liver Patty Taig. So long as you can stumble to your heretical Church Sunday it's all good.<br>
<br>
Yeah I read your source, it's the first one to pop up showing you did no further research. No 1,000 troops is not evidence of a full reversal of Kennedy's original order and I still don't trust MacNamara. "Lol look up my claims," no. I didn't make you search even for obvious information like Chappaquiddick (which you probably live next to), it's your job to provide the proof for your claims. Aren't you Irishmen supposed to be the good journalists? Or did Jews completely replace you in that field? Like the Chinese did on the railroads and blacks did in complaining. At least you still dominate voting for politicians who work against you.

I wonder how many times you'll go running around in this circle lol.

Stalin wasn't a jew any more than Hitler was. That's pilpul to make people question their history. Kind of like what T-Bitty's trying to do with Kennedy. I'd start by asking how those are jewish clothes since I've never seen jews dressed like that. And even if they were,that doesn't mean Stalin's a jew for wearing it anymore than Trump is for wearing a tiny hat in Israel. Look at his actions. He removed the antisemitism and antichristian laws. No jew would do that,especially not the antisemitism laws. They also wouldn't purge jews from high office. That weakens jewish control,they wouldn't do that. It wouldn't make sense. Stalin grew up around and worked with jews his whole life. So he knew what they were and when he got the chance,he moved against them. Which is why the jews lost control of Russia and started red scare propaganda in the 50s,focused on Russia. It's also why the jews killed him.<br>
<br>
This line right here: "Joseph Kennedy is not John Kennedy. Plus his views on WW2 were a matter of pragmatism and honesty. Anyone could see the Nazi had done nothing wrong. Plus who likes Jews?"<br>
<br>
That's been the point of the whole argument. JFK hated the jews. He did what they wanted because it was necessary to gain high office. If he hadn't,he'd have been kicked out of office like Nixon was. Or did you not realize Woodward and Bernstein were jews? But in the end,he'd started doing too much shit to weaken their control and they had to get rid of him immediately. They didn't have time for a simple scandal to get him out of office. And Jack Ruby killed Oswald to keep him quiet. The hands of the jews are obvious to those who look for them.<br>
<br>
But no,everyone hates jews. Especially the people who work for them.
</div></blockquote>
Name one thing JFK did that was anti Jewish or pro American. That is the point that must be proven.

Look at your source. It's hyper partisan (ex: it gives Kennedy credit for ending the Cuba Missile Crisis) and it links to numerous pages that don't exist. I know, I tried to use them. All it says is that Kennedy agreed to remove a thousand troops out of over ten thousand he sent.  This does not prove the man who's most famous speech was that America should be the world's policemen and who sent the troops to begin with was about to substantially reverse his decisions.<br>
<br>
Notice how this is your last point you latch on to after I disproved the rest? You're spamming me with the same link, instead of saying "wow maybe I was wrong about JFK" you double down on this last point that even at it's very best makes JFK look bipolar, but in actuality is just more evidence he was a bad guy.<br>
<br>
I guess pointing out how nonsensical you've become was upsetting. There's nothing wrong with being wrong, there is a problem when you start calling people Jews when they prove you wrong. Before you say it, I called merlynn a Jew not because he disagreed, but because he supported Zionism and Hedonism (and because he's rude to everyone first, but that could just be for lols), before that I assumed he was a delusional boomer. Anyway, another problem is refusing to learn because of emotions, whatever connection you hold with Kennedy (being a taig) doesn't mean he was on your side. Be it stupidity or maliciousness, he was never going to be either.</div>

Exactly as I said. But you're deflecting attention away from that and digressing to other nitpicks that have nothing to do with the fact that he ordered the first wave to return. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>  This does not prove the man who's most famous speech was that America should be the world's policemen and who sent the troops to begin with was about to substantially reverse his decisions.</div></blockquote>

Yes it does prove he was going to withdraw, and you're trying to translate a speech into your own interpretation and you misquoted him as such.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Notice how this is your last point you latch on to after I disproved the rest?</div></blockquote>

Nope, it's the fact that he did order a withdrawal and was killed before he could complete it. It clearly states that was his goal.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> You're spamming me with the same link, instead of saying "wow maybe I was wrong about JFK" you double down on this last point that even at it's very best makes JFK look bipolar, but in actuality is just more evidence he was a bad guy.</div></blockquote>

Nice troll, they're several different links all saying the same thing. You're trolling, instead of saying "Wow maybe I was wrong and JFK really did want to withdraw!" <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> I guess pointing out how nonsensical you've become was upsetting. There's nothing wrong with being wrong, there is a problem when you start calling people Jews when they prove you wrong.

</div></blockquote>

You'd do well to take your own advice. We never said he didn't serve jews, yet you keep trying to deflect and act as if we said he didn't. You accused us of claiming he was /ourguy/ and worshipping him all without a shred of evidence. We've maintained this entire conversation that he was a puppet that hated his handlers. I see what you're trying to do and it won't work. That's why I call you schlomo. You're a total hypocrite in what you're trying to say I'm doing.</div>

Right back at ya, schlomo. <br>
<br>
<a href="http://jfkmoon.org/vietnam.html" class="postlink">http://jfkmoon.org/vietnam.html</a>
</div></blockquote>
<img alt="😒" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f612.svg"> sigh, you just can't swallow your pride can you?<br>
<br>
Look at your source. It's hyper partisan (ex: it gives Kennedy credit for ending the Cuba Missile Crisis) and it links to numerous pages that don't exist. I know, I tried to use them. All it says is that Kennedy agreed to remove a thousand troops out of over ten thousand he sent. </div></blockquote>

Exactly as I said. But you're deflecting attention away from that and digressing to other nitpicks that have nothing to do with the fact that he ordered the first wave to return. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>  This does not prove the man who's most famous speech was that America should be the world's policemen and who sent the troops to begin with was about to substantially reverse his decisions.</div></blockquote>

Yes it does prove he was going to withdraw, and you're trying to translate a speech into your own interpretation and you misquoted him as such.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Notice how this is your last point you latch on to after I disproved the rest?</div></blockquote>

Nope, it's the fact that he did order a withdrawal and was killed before he could complete it. It clearly states that was his goal.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> You're spamming me with the same link, instead of saying "wow maybe I was wrong about JFK" you double down on this last point that even at it's very best makes JFK look bipolar, but in actuality is just more evidence he was a bad guy.</div></blockquote>

Nice troll, they're several different links all saying the same thing. You're trolling, instead of saying "Wow maybe I was wrong and JFK really did want to withdraw!" <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> I guess pointing out how nonsensical you've become was upsetting. There's nothing wrong with being wrong, there is a problem when you start calling people Jews when they prove you wrong. Before you say it, I called merlynn a Jew not because he disagreed, but because he supported Zionism and Hedonism (and because he's rude to everyone first, but that could just be for lols), before that <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:red">I assumed</span></span></strong> he was a delusional boomer. Anyway, another problem is refusing to learn because of emotions, whatever connection you hold with Kennedy (being a taig) doesn't mean he was on your side. Be it stupidity or maliciousness, he was never going to be either.
</div></blockquote>

You'd do well to take your own advice. We never said he didn't serve jews, yet you keep trying to deflect and act as if we said he didn't. You accused us of claiming he was /ourguy/ and worshipping him all without a shred of evidence. We've maintained this entire conversation that he was a puppet that hated his handlers. I see what you're trying to do and it won't work. That's why I call you schlomo. You're a total hypocrite in what you're trying to say I'm doing.
</div></blockquote>
He ordered one thousand troops out of the sixteen thousand he sent to return home. That's not the same as him ending the American involvement he started as I stated before you even sent your links. I sent you the speech, you refused to read it like your own sources, I gave a very accurate description of it though. No, see before. Two hyper partisan links that link to broken links and previous ones I said I didn't trust (as well as a few okay ones that don't provide enough proof for your false claim), good job. Yes, you claimed he was going to end the Fed despite the fact he supported the Fed, which I proved at the beginning, then you tried claiming it again later on. Even then, you have to prove he hated his handlers, which you haven't done (because you can't read his mind). If you didn't like Kennedy you would have accepted the facts at the start instead of blindly denying them. Frankly I'm losing interest, you're all the worst stereotypes of a Taig and you never intended to listen. You don't address all my points and instead use the same inaccurate insults, meanwhile I address your points as soon as I can and my insults are spot on.<br>
<br>
We done yet? Or do you have more hairs to split? More falsehoods to repeat? More time to kill? Or will you admit you were wrong about Kennedy?</div>

<br>
Look at your source. It's hyper partisan (ex: it gives Kennedy credit for ending the Cuba Missile Crisis) and it links to numerous pages that don't exist. I know, I tried to use them. All it says is that Kennedy agreed to remove a thousand troops out of over ten thousand he sent. </div></blockquote>

Exactly as I said. But you're deflecting attention away from that and digressing to other nitpicks that have nothing to do with the fact that he ordered the first wave to return. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>  This does not prove the man who's most famous speech was that America should be the world's policemen and who sent the troops to begin with was about to substantially reverse his decisions.</div></blockquote>

Yes it does prove he was going to withdraw, and you're trying to translate a speech into your own interpretation and you misquoted him as such.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Notice how this is your last point you latch on to after I disproved the rest?</div></blockquote>

Nope, it's the fact that he did order a withdrawal and was killed before he could complete it. It clearly states that was his goal.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> You're spamming me with the same link, instead of saying "wow maybe I was wrong about JFK" you double down on this last point that even at it's very best makes JFK look bipolar, but in actuality is just more evidence he was a bad guy.</div></blockquote>

Nice troll, they're several different links all saying the same thing. You're trolling, instead of saying "Wow maybe I was wrong and JFK really did want to withdraw!" <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> I guess pointing out how nonsensical you've become was upsetting. There's nothing wrong with being wrong, there is a problem when you start calling people Jews when they prove you wrong. Before you say it, I called merlynn a Jew not because he disagreed, but because he supported Zionism and Hedonism (and because he's rude to everyone first, but that could just be for lols), before that <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:red">I assumed</span></span></strong> he was a delusional boomer. Anyway, another problem is refusing to learn because of emotions, whatever connection you hold with Kennedy (being a taig) doesn't mean he was on your side. Be it stupidity or maliciousness, he was never going to be either.
</div></blockquote>

You'd do well to take your own advice. We never said he didn't serve jews, yet you keep trying to deflect and act as if we said he didn't. You accused us of claiming he was /ourguy/ and worshipping him all without a shred of evidence. We've maintained this entire conversation that he was a puppet that hated his handlers. I see what you're trying to do and it won't work. That's why I call you schlomo. You're a total hypocrite in what you're trying to say I'm doing.
</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:yellow">He ordered one thousand troops</span></span></strong> out of the sixteen thousand he sent <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:yellow">to return home</span></span></strong>. </div></blockquote>

The first time you actually acknowledged my facts, wow, progress! <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>That's not the same as him ending the American involvement he started as I stated before you even sent your links. </div></blockquote>

Yeah, umm... <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:red"> BECAUSE HE WAS FUCKING KILLED!!</span></strong> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> I sent you the speech, you refused to read it</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
I sent you his speech, you refused to read it<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> ... like your own sources, I gave a very accurate description of it though. </div></blockquote>

Not when you're misquoting, taking out of context, making leaps and bounds out of his overall message that is nothing more than speculation. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>No, see before. Two hyper partisan links that link to broken links and previous ones I said I didn't trust (as well as a few okay ones that don't provide enough proof for your false claim), good job. Yes, you claimed he was going to end the Fed despite the fact he supported the Fed, which I proved at the beginning, then you tried claiming it again later on. Even then, you have to prove he hated his handlers, which you haven't done (because you can't read his mind). If you didn't like Kennedy you would have accepted the facts at the start instead of blindly denying them. Frankly I'm losing interest, you're all the worst stereotypes of a Taig and you never intended to listen. You don't address all my points and instead use the same inaccurate insults, meanwhile I address your points as soon as I can and my insults are spot on.</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
Link to the comment where I said he was going to end the fed. It's funny how bad your projection is; you claim I don't address all your points when here I am taking your entire response, and breaking it up point by point to address them - something you have yet to do. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We done yet? Or do you have more hairs to split? More falsehoods to repeat? More time to kill? Or will you admit you were wrong about Kennedy?
</div></blockquote>

It's almost like you're pretending you don't recall what happened the day before, but you continue to rattle off the same old nonsense as if nothing at all had happened, and you insist you had proven your assertions correct. <br>

So what you're saying is, Kennedy like you was a fag. I've acknowledged that several times now, notice the 16 thousand troops he sent, you even included it. He WaS kIlLeD. Good, fuck that Vietnam starting Jew puppet. Link to comments? It's you and merlynn's first or second comments each. Not hard to find. No, you didn't send the speeches, I did. Are you this retarded or do you really think you can lie your way out of this? If you fucking read the speech you'd see I'm right. You literally argue exactly like that, Taig.<br>

Also who's we? The voices in your head? It's just you and me here rn.</div>

I didn't think you'd be able to link to them, in fact I knew you wouldn't. Because they aren't there because we didn't make those comments - you did. You projecting faggot.</div>

Then I started to develop a following. This is really what triggered a response.

And merlynn's first reply (I don't know how to quote two at once):<br>
Well,T-Bitty,the simple fact is that JFK may have lied about supporting the jews to get into office. I mean,they killed him for some reason. This is along the lines of the argument that simply because Churchill worked for the jews,he also loved them. Churchill probably hated those bastards more than Hitler ever did. Most people who know about the true nature of the jews do. If he could've taken them down without being dragged down with them,he'd have jumped at the chance. Stalin did. Of course,they got him back,but still.<br>

It's on the first page. You really want a link? <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=3273" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=3273</a><br>
<br>
So yes. You did claim JFK opposed the Fed/our current Jew run banking system and merlynn claimed he secretly hated being a puppet even though that's not a provable claim and it isn't relevant since JFK never did anything to upset his masters.<br>

Here's where your pilpul shines: <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yes, you claimed he was going to end the Fed </div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
Then when challenged to link it: <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>You did claim JFK opposed the Fed/our current Jew run banking system</div></blockquote>

Two completely different claims. <br>
<br>
Then your quote of @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=149174" class="username">merlynn132</a> doesn't even support your claim let alone prove it. All he said was they killed him for "some reason". Like, WTF how is that even remotely proving your point? lol</div>

My first ban came when I posted a pic of Gaddafi and JFK to illustrate what happens when you try to start your own bank. Ironically they were deplatformed for allowing Nazi content, to which I felt a tad bit responsible. So trying to be a good sport:..
</div></blockquote>
And merlynn's first reply (I don't know how to quote two at once):<br>
Well,T-Bitty,the simple fact is that JFK may have lied about supporting the jews to get into office. I mean,they killed him for some reason. This is along the lines of the argument that simply because Churchill worked for the jews,he also loved them. Churchill probably hated those bastards more than Hitler ever did. Most people who know about the true nature of the jews do. If he could've taken them down without being dragged down with them,he'd have jumped at the chance. Stalin did. Of course,they got him back,but still.<br>
...<br>
<br>
It's on the first page. You really want a link? <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=3273" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=3273</a><br>
<br>
So yes. You did claim JFK opposed the Fed/our current Jew run banking system and merlynn claimed he secretly hated being a puppet even though that's not a provable claim and it isn't relevant since JFK never did anything to upset his masters.<br>

</div></blockquote>

Here's where your pilpul shines: <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yes, you claimed he was going to end the Fed </div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
Then when challenged to link it: <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>You did claim JFK opposed the Fed/our current Jew run banking system</div></blockquote>

Two completely different claims. <br>
<br>
Then your quote of @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=149174" class="username">merlynn132</a> doesn't even support your claim let alone prove it. All he said was they killed him for "some reason". Like, WTF how is that even remotely proving your point? lol
</div></blockquote>
You're claiming the Fed isn't run by Jews? And merlynn claiming Kennedy might have hated his Jewish masters doesn't prove merlynn claimed Kennedy might have hated his Jewish masters? Incredible, instead of admitting you were wrong you double down yet again, even when faced with your own words! Alright I'm done, if you're going to deny your own words that I was kind enough to link for you there was never a point in debating you, even merlynn didn't do that.<br>
<br>
Was this a hint ALS? First you counted on no one disputing your claim. Then you played dumb. You then argued what you were arguing. I needn't wait long to see you make this claim again I reckon. <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/6ahcar.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
However, I still doubt you're a Jew, I imagine you're just a Taig with an exceptional lack of self awareness, but behind a computer who's to say? Oh well, I can't debate a man who disputes his own words no matter what ethnicity he is.</div>

And again you didn't address my points. You instead deflect to a misquoted point that wasn't even accurate. You're recoiling and speaking nonsense. I'm... I'm... I'm just... Absolutely shocked!</div>

Excellent post! I will nit pick and point out JFK was a staunch supporter of Israel and supported Jews running our banks (EO 11110 was to make getting rid of the gold standard for US citizens easier). The guy arguing "muh Brits were good guys" was retarded enough to annoy me. It's a fact accepted by even Jewish sources today Britain began bombing civilians for the purpose of sowing terror, not the Germans who tried to get the Brits to comply with the Geneva convention. Also Britain's only real allies were France and Portugal. The former decided to join Germany instead of Britain. I find it funny when people say Europe was liberated from Germany when only like the Dutch and the Soviets didn't willingly ally with Germany.<br>
As for your call to action at the end, I had a YouTube account I would comment with, as based as I could get it. I would waste time trying to expose the truth to sheep. I occasionally succeeded, the Jews I dealt with were usually Mossad, their tell is never shutting up. Other Jews tells were telling bold lies, than acting as described here when called out, and being generally nasty. I don't think you can educate 99% of their useful idiots. Nearly everyone believes in muh Hololocaust to the point where even if you prove it didn't happen (even though you shouldn't have to, it's their job to prove it did happen) to them, they'll reset the next day. One day without warning my account got terminated, I didn't know YouTube did for comments alone, but evidently they do. Hundreds of sources and excellent points, for nothing. Fun fact, the YouTube channel "Emperor Tigerstar" is run by a colossal faggot who believes neutering literal prepubescent children is okay and hates free speech, but people still watch him.

What's funny about this is that I did say JFK opposed the fed. It's in the thread somewhere. And he quotes a post that doesn't say that. Not even close. This jew is defective.
</div></blockquote>
He wasn't asking for that part on you, and no kidding, you claimed it even after I sent you Kennedy's speeches and reports to Congress where he said he supported the Fed. How'd I get stuck arguing two Jews?
</div></blockquote>

Except you claimed I said it. And you couldn't link it. Fucking retard.
