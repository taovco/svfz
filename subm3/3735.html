			<div class="content">In the last couple of days I've been shocked to find that Robert David Steele and Lawrence Bloom have passed away, both reportedly within the last week and a half, due to complications from COVID-19.  Being a tin-foil hat conspiracy theorist, I thought I'd do a post on both men and even highlight the common network that they shared.<br>
<br>
I'll start with RDS.. <br>
<br>
What’s Politician Robert David Steele’s Cause of Death at 69? <a href="https://usdaynews.com/celebrities/celebrity-death/robert-david-steele-death-cause/" class="postlink">https://usdaynews.com/celebrities/celeb ... ath-cause/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A 39-year veteran of the USMC and the CIA has sadly passed away. American politician, Robert David Steele’s cause of death, is not to be announced yet; however, it is reported that he was admitted to the hospital on August 16 and was reportedly diagnosed with Covid.<br>
<br>
US day News doesn’t confirm or refuse this reason for his death, but we are waiting for more official information, so stay with us.<br>
<br>
Robert David Steele was a retired politician and former military intelligence officer. Steele worked and managed several operations under his belt. He was also an author and had written many books on secret intelligence agencies. ..<br>
<br>
How did Robert David Steele Die?<br>
Mark Tassi, Robert Steele’s close friend, has confirmed his death on a video and shared it on Twitter on Sunday, August 29, 2021. It is reported that Robert David Steele died in a hospital in Florida after he was diagnosed with Coronavirus.<br>
<br>
As his condition got worse, they shifted him to the ventilator, but they couldn’t save his life as he had declined to take any of the Covid19 vaccines, being a protestor of the vaccine and the COVID himself...<br>
<br>
An online user wrote on Twitter: “I have a hard time believing Robert David Steele died of Covid…….. I don’t know what happened to him, but this makes no sense.”<br>
<br>
Robert David Steele leaves behind his wife Kathy and three sons, Patrick James Steele, Matthew Brian Steele, and Sean Joseph Steele. His wife was Kathy Lynette Steele. The couple got married in 1988. The family needs privacy; please respect them during this difficult time.</div></blockquote>

There is much speculation on Twitter and 2 accounts in particular are standing out to me because of the vitriol spewed at the 'conspiracy crowd'..  One is Dave Troy <a href="https://twitter.com/davetroy" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/davetroy</a> : 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Curator, TEDxMidAtlantic. Johns Hopkins. <a href="http://davetroy.medium.com" class="postlink">http://davetroy.medium.com</a>
</div></blockquote>

In the last few hours he tweeted this in response to a February tweet from Steele accusing Troy of pedophilia <a href="https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1432082625070604293" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1432082625070604293</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Bless his heart</div></blockquote>

Steele's tweet: <a href="https://twitter.com/OSSRobertSteele/status/1361145550121422850" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/OSSRobertSteele/sta ... 0121422850</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><a href="https://pedoempire.org" class="postlink">https://pedoempire.org</a> <a href="https://stopnakedshortselling.org" class="postlink">https://stopnakedshortselling.org</a> <a href="https://unrig.net" class="postlink">https://unrig.net</a><br>
 you are such as stupid ignorant fuck.  We have it all asshole.  Every email, every text, every banking transaction.  Look for your name in the tag clouds.
</div></blockquote>

I was no fan of Steele but I find the trolling of him now that he's dead quite shocking.<br>
<br>
The other account which seems to work in tandem with Troy is Jim Stewartson, a 'anti-disinfo activist' who seems obsessed still with Qanon and the so-called Jan. 6th 'insurrection'. Apparently he hasn't yet got the memo from the FBI that there wasn't one. Still pinned at the top of his account : <a href="https://twitter.com/jimstewartson/status/1349580433114226688" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/jimstewartson/statu ... 3114226688</a> 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It was QANON.<br>
It was a CULT. <br>
It was a PSYOP. <br>
<br>
The insurrection last week was not just “political violence”, it was the result of a planned psychological operation.<br>
<br>
It was an attack by a foreign power with the aid domestic terrorists. We must not forget.<br>
<br>

</div></blockquote>

I had a look at our most recent post relating to RDS:<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">Perversion of the "TRUTH" Doctors, the UN's Parvati Foundation and the Supreme Master Ching Hai satanists </span><a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=3306" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=3306</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>By 'perversion' I mean corruption... I've just seen a video which points to the Academy of Divine Knowledge <a href="https://academyofdk.com/" class="postlink">https://academyofdk.com/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Some of their 'teachers' : <a href="https://academyofdk.com/meet-our-teachers/" class="postlink">https://academyofdk.com/meet-our-teachers/</a><br>

Look who else is involved.. the ITNJ aka Robert David Steele, Sacha Stone et al <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/f1vk4w.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/f1vk4w.jpg</a><br>
<br>
Sacha Stone receiving an award at the UN for his org Humanitad .. Support for Humanitad's 2009 UN award from the <span style="color:#FF0040">Point of Peace Foundation</span>, Norway <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/2p9v1v.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/2p9v1v.jpg</a> .. The organization has in project the web-based “Peace Channel” in cooperation with Bob Geldof, and his London based company Ten Alps, aimed to be launched in September 2008.<br>
<br>
..This was all starting to sound familiar.. so I did a search for Bob with the Parvati Foundation.. ..<span style="color:#FF0040">Parvati v</span>olunteers her time and all her creative work to its immediate realization. She is using her voice, her creativity and her music connections for change. <span style="color:#FF0040">Bob Geldof’s partner in Live Aid, legendary concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith, is now part of the MAPS production team</span> to onboard the music industry with a ‘Live Aid for the Arctic” themed concert.
</div></blockquote>

And there's our <span style="color:#FF0040">Lawrence Bloom</span> connection. He was on the Advisory Board of the Parvati Foundation, as I've written about now many times on this forum... From their twitter account on 22nd August: <a href="https://twitter.com/ParvatiOfficial/status/1429556659962191878" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/ParvatiOfficial/sta ... 9962191878</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Deeply saddened to lose colleague and friend Lawrence Bloom to COVID-19. He had exceptional insight, heart and vision. Thank you Lawrence for being the shining star that you are. Our lives are richer for having had you in it.
</div></blockquote>

Another account which mentioned his passing - Bawa Jain - <em class="text-italics">Visionary leader in the interfaith movement and a pioneer of religious diplomacy.</em>   <a href="https://twitter.com/IamBawaJain/status/1429488174770933761" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/IamBawaJain/status/ ... 4770933761</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Our Amigo Lawrence Bloom passed away Friday morning with complications due to Covid-19.<br>
"Oh setting Sun, as in your red rays, Lawrence's day is set....Go forth in peace my friend and do even more now that you are freed from physical bondage. Adios Amigo!" - Your Friend, Bawa Jain
</div></blockquote>

This is an intriguing account because Bawa Jain works with the UN and deals with some high profile people yet the interactions with his social media are next to nothing.  His profile banner photo includes an image of Jane Goodall.  She is also on the board of the Parvati Foundation <a href="https://twitter.com/IamBawaJain/header_photo" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/IamBawaJain/header_photo</a><br>
<br>
Jain was clearly close to Lawrence Bloom and there are many photos of the two of them, particularly on their most recent trip to Mexico. On his Instagram account there are a number of photos with Bloom and Val Jon Farris <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CROwtoJrovB/" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/CROwtoJrovB/</a><br>
<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/sdua7h.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/sdua7h.jpg</a><br>

Val Jon Farris  is yet another leadership guru endorsed by Richard Branson

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>.When NEXUS did it’s event at the White House this year, all the competing presidential delegates were invited to send a representative to present their case to the group.

<br>
..Juan Carlos Kaiten, Social Architect for Systemic Transformation at The Hague Center and the Foundation for Conscious Evolution, added, “Social Acupuncture means both having the sensitivity to understand .. we have to harness technology like Aaron is doing and like in the project <span style="color:#FF0040">Barbara Marx Hubbard</span> and Dr. Don Beck are doing via the Foundation for Conscious Evolution, The Memnosyne Institute and Be Earth Foundation with the Planetary Indaba project bringing the Vital Signs Monitor based on Spiral Dynamics with the Wheel of CoCreation.... <span style="color:#FF0040">Lawrence Bloom, Secretary General Be Earth Foundation, (a UN Inter Governmental Organization), spoke up</span>, “Yes, it takes all this and it will take businesses being willing to act with this understanding. For example, Be Earth Foundation is part of a set of negotiations that would enable 1,500 Km of spine road across South America with service areas approximately every 100Km and it is our intention, subject to a successful outcome, to link the Memnosyne Institute’s School Out of A Box program into each one of those service areas as part of our social program. <br>
<br>
...The vision of NEXUS is growing still, and as I age towards becoming an Advisor, instead of just a member, I can do so knowing that the millennials are already hitting the ground running full speed ahead. Like Don Beck, <span style="color:#FF0040">Ervin Laszlo, and Barbara Marx Hubbard </span>have often told my husband Joshua Frenk and myself, that they feel just a little better knowing that we will be carrying on the work of understanding why an integral approach is necessary more than ever in the 21st century..<br>

Strange people, strange times.  Speaking of Draper's employers.. there's a connection to the #together campaign.. which I'll leave for another post.  Everything we see right now on TV from the Afghans running alongside a fake plane, to ex-British military bringing stray cats and dogs home, is a psyop.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Project Harvest Moon was a first effort by private individuals to explore and exploit the Moon. Sponsored by the Committee for the Future, "the original space advocacy organization in the NASA era," Harvest Moon would have used a leftover Saturn rocket and lunar module to conduct experiments on the Moon, paid for by the sale of lunar materials retrieved from the Moon's surface.[1] The Committee for the Future was founded and propelled by Barbara Marx Hubbard, daughter of wealthy toy manufacturer Louis Marx. Hubbard received support from retired military officers, former NASA employees, and prominent industrialists. On May 11, 1972, Rep. Olin Teague (D-Tex) offered a Resolution in support, but the project was terminated that summer following cogent objections from NASA.<br>
<br>
Committee for the Future<br>
The Committee for the Future was founded in 1970 by Barbara Marx Hubbard, its organizing director and prime mover,[2][3][4] with headquarters in Lakeville, Connecticut. Her father, Louis Marx, provided advice to the committee and some funding.[4][5] Other prominent members included its Chairman, Gen. Joseph S. Bleymaier, USAF-ret.;[4][5] Executive Director John J. Whiteside, USAF-ret.;[3][4] Richard Nolte, President, Thiokol;[3] Dr. Harold W. Ritchey, Board Chairman, Thiokol;[2][3][4] George Van Valkenburg,[3] producer of the documentary, The Log of Apollo 7;[6] diamond expert Ronald Winston;[2] and John F. Yardley, Vice President of McDonnell Douglas.[4] According to Whiteside, the committee's goals were "to develop within ten years a lunar community open to people of all nations as the next step in developing the solar system for man. At the same time to apply the most advanced systems and knowledge to overall earth problems." Harvest Moon was an outgrowth of these objectives.<br>
<br>
The mission of Harvest Moon was to use leftover Saturn rockets and lunar modules from the Apollo program's space flights to fly two astronauts to the Moon, where they would set up automated experiments that could be controlled from Earth, collect one to four hundred pounds of lunar rocks, and return to Earth, where the collected material would be divided into tiny fragments and sold to the public.[2] The cost to investors was estimated by the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to be $150–$250 million, but income could reach $400 million.[2] Profits would go to charity.[3] The mission would be controlled by NASA.[8] In addition to the acquisition of lunar material, two experiments were proposed. The first, with an eventual Moon colony in mind, was a twenty-foot mylar dome under which plants, insects, and possibly small animals would be observed for their reaction to the two-week-long lunar day. The second experiment would be a lunar observatory which would provide remote-controlled fourteen-day exposures through the negligible lunar atmosphere.[5][9] The privately funded International Lunar Observatory, to be launched in 2019, is a modern realization of the Harvest Moon proposal.[10] The advantages of a Moon observatory had been discussed at the beginning of the space age by Willy Ley<br>
<br>
Suggested by George Van Valkenburg in October 1970,[12][13] Project Harvest Moon was developed by the New Worlds Company, incorporated by the Committee for the Future in 1970.[8] After the financial analysis by the brokerage firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the project was publicized in the summer of 1971 and reviewed by independent newspapers and syndicated columnists such as Bob Considine.[2][3][5][8][14] On March 9, 1972, the Project received a hearing by the House Subcommittee on Manned Flight, chaired by Rep. Olin Teague (D-Tex),[7] a vocal supporter,[15] who submitted a House Resolution instructing NASA to "reserve a Saturn 5 rocket, a command service module, and a lunar module for possible use by a transnational mission".[16] On July 18, however, a spokesman from NASA, which had remained lukewarm to the project,[2] reported that there were no serviceable lunar modules.[4] Having terminated Harvest Moon, the Committee for the Future moved on to other space proposals

Barbara Marx Hubbard and the Origins of the Pro-Space Movement in the 1970s <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/barbara-marx-hubbard-and-origins-pro-space-movement-1970s" class="postlink">https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/edit ... ment-1970s</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The formal beginnings of the modern "pro-space movement"—really an extension of the ad hoc efforts to gain and sustain public support for an aggressive spaceflight agenda earlier led by Wernher von Braun and others—might be best traced to the June 1970 formation of the Committee for the Future (CFF), a small group of space activists, dreamers, and misfits. Meeting in the home of Barbara Marx Hubbard, daughter of the toy king, and her husband, artist-philosopher Earl Hubbard, in Lakeville, Connecticut, they proposed establishing a lunar colony. They unabashedly offered this as a great utopian experiment in which humanity, free from the constraints of everyday society, could create a perfect community.<br>
<br>
The CFF's charter clearly voiced these utopian ideals: "Earth-bound history has ended. Universal history has begun. Mankind has been born into an environment of immeasurable possibilities. We, the Committee for the Future, believe that the long-range goal for Mankind should be to seek and settle new worlds. To survive and realize the common aspiration of all people for a future of unlimited opportunity, this generation must begin now to find the means of converting the planets into life support systems for the race of Men." They concluded, "A Challenge of this magnitude can emancipate the genius of Man." ..<br>
<br>
Barbara Marx Hubbard has remained involved in futurist activities since this time. She was a founding member of <span style="color:#FF0040">the World Future Society, the Society for the Universal Human, and co-founder of the Foundation for Conscious Evolution</span>.</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">Harry Vox had some interesting insights into what was going on with RDS in his last few days.  Apparently he had fallen out with Sacha Stone and left the Arise Tour.. he accused them of stealing money from him.. Vox didn't quite believe him. Also RDS's wife was divorcing him... The usual mess that these characters have... when they are about to do a pivot in the narrative? <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/GoAW8laml0dc/" class="postlink">https://www.bitchute.com/video/GoAW8laml0dc/</a><br>
<br>
Looking for obits... I can't find much on either of these two men...<br>
<br>
This one shows that RDS was apparently cremated but I had to go to cache to see it: <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:X0zyyWaV-p4J:https://www.news-press.com/obituaries/fnp095074+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ch" class="postlink">https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/ ... clnk&amp;gl=ch</a><br>
<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/j1duef.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/j1duef.jpg</a><br>
<br>
This is the kind of coverage he is getting in the press: Former CIA officer and conspiracy theorist who called pandemic a hoax dies of Covid <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/qanon-anti-vaxxer-dies-from-covid-b1911586.html" class="postlink">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/worl ... 11586.html</a><br>
<br>
Meanwhile I can't find anything on Lawrence Bloom at all. Except for his daughter, who calls herself Rebekah Shaman.. I can't find it now, but I read one of her posts that Bloom was cremated and his ashes scattered in Mexico. That's where he was when he fell ill.  <br>
<br>
I want to point out a dialogue on one of her posts : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rebekah.shaman/posts/10159348398795950" class="postlink">https://www.facebook.com/rebekah.shaman ... 8398795950</a><br>
<br>
Rebekah posted the following on August 30th:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Those of you who have lost a parent know what a life changing process it is. <br>
For the last week I have been working through deep ancestral karma and hidden/suppressed feelings that have gushed to the surface.<br>
It’s as if the dam that held back a lifetime of experience has crumbled, releasing a tidal wave of emotion.<br>
Unfortunately there was no time to physically complete with my father. By the time I arrived in Mexico he was already very poorly.<br>
We are not given the tools to deal with death, especially death of a parent and if we are not prepared, the shock and after affects can last for years.<br>
What this process has taught me is to make peace with your family now, while they are living. <br>
This killer virus is showing us our fragility. Please take it seriously because your loved ones could pass over suddenly. <br>
Tie up loose emotional  ends, make peace, accept your differences, hug more and most importantly enjoy each day with them as if it was your/their last because life is fleeting and it’s easier to find completion in life, then it is in death.
</div></blockquote>

Someone challenged her use of the phrase 'killer virus'..

Tony Sayers is one of a slew of men suddenly making videos calling out the New Age scene and other 'actors'.. make of that what you will... here is his YT channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TonySayers/videos" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/c/TonySayers/videos</a><br>
<br>
Vox does point out that RDS worked heavily with military psyop units.  Seems to me that the psyops within psyops program  has gone into overdrive.  It seems to me two things are happening simultaneously: we are in a race.. (1) their House of Cards narrative is falling down around them as researchers like us, otherwise known as tin-foil hat consiracy theorists, have caught up with the agenda and lies and are now pulling ahead of the psyops and even predicting what comes next.. as against (2) the extremely speedy implementation of the NWO high-tech enslavement system.  It's up to Humanity what happens next.</div>

James, is the elder child and only son of Sir Angus Ogilvy and Princess Alexandra of Kent... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Ogilvy" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Ogilvy</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sir Angus James Bruce Ogilvy KCVO (14 September 1928 – 26 December 2004) was a British businessman. He is best known as the husband of Princess Alexandra, a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.<br>
<br>
Ogilvy is also remembered for his role in a scandal involving the breaking of sanctions against the regime in Rhodesia in the 1970s in the Lonrho affair. In later years, he was heavily involved in charity work.<br>
<br>
Angus Ogilvy was born in London, the second son of the 12th Earl of Airlie and Lady Alexandra Coke, the daughter of the 3rd Earl of Leicester.[1] Many of his relatives had close links with the British Royal Family.[1] His grandmother, Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie, was a close friend and Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Mary.[1] His father was a lord-in-waiting to George V and Lord Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother).[1] He was a second cousin of Diana Mosley, second cousin of Lavinia Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk, and a second cousin once removed of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury. He was also third cousin, once removed of Pamela Harriman...<br>
<br>
On 24 April 1963, Ogilvy married Princess Alexandra of Kent, a granddaughter of George V and a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, at Westminster Abbey in London.[4][5] The wedding ceremony was attended by all the members of the royal family and was broadcast worldwide on television, watched by an estimated 200 million people.<br>
<br>
The Queen had offered Ogilvy an earldom on his wedding, which he declined.[6] He also rejected a grace-and-favour apartment at one of the royal palaces. Instead, he leased Thatched House Lodge in Richmond, London from the Crown Estate for him and Princess Alexandra to live in,[2] and where she still lives today. However, Princess Alexandra retained an apartment at St James's Palace, which is customary for the royal family...<br>
<br>
After his business career was blighted, Ogilvy was involved with charity work.[4] He served as president of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, and as chairman of Youth Clubs UK, the biggest non-uniformed youth organisation in Britain. He was patron of Arthritis Care; vice-patron of the National Children's Homes; chairman of the advisory council of The Prince's Trust; a trustee of the Leeds Castle Foundation, as well as being a member of the governing council of Business in the Community, and of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.[2] He was also a member of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Royal Company of Archers</span>, the Sovereign's Bodyguard in Scotland,[2] in which his father served as one of its four lieutenants.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
M&amp;E Contractor, Synecore recently hosted a Charity Golf Day and raised £12,000 for Holding ON Letting Go. Over 100 Building Service Professionals from across the UK were welcomed to the Tudor Park Hotel and Country Club in Maidstone on Friday 29th September to play golf and raise significant funds for the charity.<br>
<br>
Synecore, delivers Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing services to major hospitality, retail and leisure brands nationwide. With such a vast network of suppliers and clients, the business wanted to utilise its fortunate position to fund raise for a local children’s charity. After much research the team discovered Holding On Letting Go, and decided that we would hugely benefit from the money Synecore raised.<br>
