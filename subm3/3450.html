Implying that James Alefantis visit has something to do with Obama visit and also implying it further by saying that Rolling Stones concert (delayed over Obama visit) is yet to happen. In fact Obama was there with official visit, and Rolling Stones concert was delayed over it.<br>

Here's more on their cooperation:<br>

<br>
Interestingly Alice Louise Waters was listed in credits of the movie named Automatic at Sea, produced by Matthew Lessner, James Alefantis and David Henry Gerson (son of Joan Nathan and Allan Gerson) - yeah, that cultish sinister movie with occult and "secret pizza", basically about girl trapped on island with Peter (played by Gerson) who goes absolutely mad:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>While being trapped in the bizarre vision she is finally trapped so much that she isn't trying to escape anymore, she joins weirdo girlfriend of Peter. Also in one vision she is eating pizza at night, very strange:<br>

<br>
At the end of the movie Martha's Vineyard location is mentioned with list of many people but also Alice Waters is being thanked as one of the people on the list:<br>

And if that's the same person as Alice Louise Waters then she is the one who sent something with writing Moloch Maschine on it to James Alefantis:<br>

Allan Gerson, husband of Joan Nathan and father of David Henry Gerson was basically hunting nazis:<br>

So you may ask, what this "cooking" stuff and "Jewish" stuff has to do with Obama/James Alefantis visit on Cuba. Well it seems so that Washington Post article I've linked earlier tells us that James Alefantis visited it with Joan Nathan and they've visited it basically to show solidarity with Jews of Cuba, article is from 2017, it described the visit as "last year" meaning Joan Nathan and James visited it in 2016, maybe perhaps March 2016 when James took pictures in Havana (when he was commented by Penzner):<br>
<br>

Continuing -&gt;<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Before his life became consumed by the madness of Pizzagate, restaurateur <strong class="text-strong">James Alefantis, the man behind Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing and Camping, took a trip to Cuba last year with the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art. He invited Nathan to join him, even though they would have different aims. Alefantis had art business to attend to. Nathan was there to visit “like all the Jews in Havana,” Alefantis jokes. “We met all these young Jewish Cubans.”</strong><br>
<br>
But they also met Paolo Titolo, husband of Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban president Raúl Castro and director of the country’s National Center for Sex Education. Titolo is an Italian photographer known for shooting members of Cuba’s transgender communities. Titolo took Nathan and Alefantis to a shantytown where they stopped at a shack with a corrugated metal roof, home to a local drag queen who makes dresses for young girls to wear to their quinceañera celebrations. Titolo told the Americans they would have to be discreet at the home.<br>
<br>
Nathan “of course, goes right over and opens the refrigerator because she’s like, ‘You can always tell where they’re from if you look in their refrigerator,’ ” Alefantis remembers. “It was perfectly clean, this refrigerator. There were just like eggs and vegetables. It turned out they had a big garden for themselves right there, and they were growing all their vegetables.”<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“For some reason, the Cubans sell lots of cabbage. Cabbage, you think of it as Eastern European, but then it occurred to me: Russia! . . . I don’t even know if I thought then about Russia bringing it to Cuba. You just keep thinking about these things.”</em><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Waters first met Nathan in 1987, when they both went on a gastronomic tour of the Soviet Union.</strong> The tour was coordinated, they later learned, by a Lithuanian nationalist who regularly sent the esteemed group of American chefs and food writers to cooking schools while the organizer apparently stirred up trouble elsewhere. Nathan wasn’t daunted by the turn of events. As she always does before a major trip, she had researched the area and had a list of people to meet. She split from the group to conduct her interviews. By herself.</div></blockquote>

Here's also interesting part about Nathan:<br>

She’s close friends with Alice Waters, the chef and matriarch of the locavore movement.</strong> She remembers names and details of interactions as if they occurred yesterday, even when they occurred more than 60 years ago, when she was a sixth-grader in Larchmont, N.Y.</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">What you need to know about Joan Nathan is that she was an aide to Teddy Kollek, a spy, mayor of Jerusalem, and one of the most important founders of Israel and named after his father's friend Theodor Herzl.  <br>
<br>
The entire crux of Pizzagate is satanic Jewish families infiltrating intelligence agencies to control governments.  <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2166431" class="postlink">I posted the Cuba trip specifically to point that out,</a> but instead got shilled and banned by Qtards who will soon be in camps LOL.<br>
<br>
The Gerson+Nathan family is an emblematic example. Note that Joan and Alice Waters started a group called Sips &amp; Suppers to host private dinners with elites like Prince Charles in DC, including a fundraiser mentioned in Politico at Pegasus "art space" with Tony Podesta and David Brock (who evidently no longer has beef with Alefantis). <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/d2n3od.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/d2n3od.jpg</a><br>
<br>
Officially, Teddy Kollek, who wrote the foreword to one of her cookbooks, is important for uniting Mossad with the CIA via his "close personal relation" with Allen Dulles. <br>
<br>
Kollek claimed he tried to warn Dulles about Kim Philby (most notorious double agent of the 20th c) when he recognized him walking through CIA headquarters but it's now known that Kollek didn't simply once meet Philby (whose father Harold was the Saudis' handler) but was even a witness at his wedding.  At that point Philby's handler was "Arnold Deutsch, an associate of the radical sex therapist Wilhelm Reich" (the Jew who put people in a box to masturbate in order to harness their energy). <br>
<br>
Point being these aren't nationalist agents at all but occult ones, and that's why mainstream treatments of this episode admit to their confusion (<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/my-lunch-with-the-spider-who-nearly-wrecked-the-cia" class="postlink">https://www.thedailybeast.com/my-lunch- ... ed-the-cia</a>).  <br>
Most importantly, they were the founders of OSS-CIA (look up Georgetown Set), and included the (Jewish) Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, protege of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who through his mother is <strong class="text-strong">one of the few publicly confirmed Frankists/Sabbateans.</strong>  <br>
<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/cne4h0.png" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/cne4h0.png</a><br>
<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/j8k8aw.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/j8k8aw.jpg</a><br>
<br>
Compare Gerson family:<br>
<br>
1. daughter Merissa Gerson<br>
 -Sex therapist etc <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/30zjyg.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/30zjyg.jpg</a><br>
- "Hebrew priestess" (spiral logo) <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/mnd9r8.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/mnd9r8.jpg</a><br>
-"inherited trauma" expert (this is a field Jews have invented to extort money indefinitely for Holocaust/slavery descendants etc) <br>
-workshop on "Jewish Queer Ritual Objects" <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/3iohmi.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/3iohmi.jpg</a><br>
-consultant for early tranny series "Transparent" by Jews who made another Jew show set in Marfa, TX <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/jnu3si.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/jnu3si.jpg</a><br>
<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/q8zmyg.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/q8zmyg.jpg</a><br>
-Wrote an "aphrodisiac" recipe in Tablet (Jewish magazine), adapted from her mom's book, called "Luzzatto Family Venetian Charoset" (another Sabbatean family currently highly placed in the federal government) <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/rcbwop.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/rcbwop.jpg</a><br>
<br>
2. Daughter Daniela ran a publication focused on promoting Zionism to the college left.  Her lesbian wife is a lawyer for immigrants.  <br>
<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/8su6c1.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/8su6c1.jpg</a><br>
<br>
3. Sam Gerson (brother of Allen)+wife Shelly Nathans are both psychanalysts in San Francisco, Tavistock-affiliated <br>
<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/6jx7n6.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/6jx7n6.jpg</a><br>
<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/5lc1jp.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/5lc1jp.jpg</a><br>
<br>
Compare to Allen Gerson himself: allegedly illegally immigrated to the US escaping the fake Holocaust and even his obituary requests donations be sent to the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.  <br>
Meanwhile his professional claim to fame is "hunting Nazis" and demonizing Libya, an enemy of Israel and the bottle-cap for African immigrants to Europe, for a plane bombing now accepted to have not in fact been perpetrated by Libya. <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/x3m76n.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/x3m76n.jpg</a><br>
<br>
The point is: <strong class="text-strong">there is no observable distinction between Satanic agendas like sexual degeneracy/mass immigration/Zionism and "legitimate" Jewish activism.</strong><br>
<br>
Gerson/Nathan even donated to the same Jewish research organization as Jeffrey Epstein <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/ryubdm.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/ryubdm.jpg</a><br>
<br>
There should be stickied threads for the major topics like Food, Art, etc. But what moderation can be expected from the SAME EXACT QTARDS AS BEFORE LOL seriously how the fuck are they still mods after such humiliation?</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What you need to know about Joan Nathan is that she was an aide to Teddy Kollek, a spy, mayor of Jerusalem, and one of the most important founders of Israel and named after his father's friend Theodor Herzl.</div></blockquote>

She graduated from the University of Michigan with a master's degree in French literature and earned a master's in public administration from Harvard University. <strong class="text-strong">For three years she lived in Israel where she worked for Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem.</strong> In 1974, working for Mayor Abraham Beame in New York, she co-founded the Ninth Avenue Food Festival. The mother of three grown children, Ms. Nathan lives in Washington, D.C. and Martha's Vineyard with her husband, attorney Allan Gerson.</div></blockquote>

Your quote
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Gerson+Nathan family is an emblematic example. Note that Joan and Alice Waters started a group called Sips &amp; Suppers to host private dinners with elites like Prince Charles in DC, including a fundraiser mentioned in Politico at Pegasus "art space" with Tony Podesta and David Brock (who evidently no longer has beef with Alefantis). <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/d2n3od.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/d2n3od.jpg</a></div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">Kollek served in a number of senior intelligence roles for the Haganah and Israel during the 1940s and 1950s.</strong></div></blockquote>

Your quote:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Kollek claimed he tried to warn Dulles about Kim Philby (most notorious double agent of the 20th c) when he recognized him walking through CIA headquarters but it's now known that Kollek didn't simply once meet Philby (whose father Harold was the Saudis' handler) but was even a witness at his wedding. At that point Philby's handler was "Arnold Deutsch, an associate of the radical sex therapist Wilhelm Reich" (the Jew who put people in a box to masturbate in order to harness their energy).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>By 1947, Kollek was head of the Jewish Agency Intelligence Organization for the Anglo-Saxon world (basically U.K. and U.S.), so it was his job to know exactly who was who in MI5 and MI6. Is it really likely that Kollek never heard that a man whose wedding he had attended was working in the very same professional circles?<br>
<br>
It may be the case that Kollek did not want to share the information with Oldfield and the others at MI6, and told instead an American spymaster, not a British one. After the “accidental” meeting at the CIA, he informed the CIA’s head of counterintelligence, James Jesus Angleton, about Philby’s background. But, as far as we know, Angleton did not act on the information—or did not seem to—leading to epic conspiracy theories.)<br>
<br>
How Kollek might have used his privileged information in the years just before Israel won its independence in 1948 will remain unclear at least for as long as those pages in the archives at Kew remain redacted.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Kollek was stunned. As a young Austrian socialist fighting the fascists in Vienna, Kollek had known Philby very well and knew his communist sympathies. Indeed, in 1934 Kollek was one of a handful of witnesses at Philby’s marriage to Litzi Friedman, “a Jewish Communist,” he told Angleton.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Most importantly, they were the founders of OSS-CIA (look up Georgetown Set), and included the (Jewish) Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, protege of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who through his mother is one of the few publicly confirmed Frankists/Sabbateans.<br>

			<div class="content">Joan Nathan Gerson - who was connected to head of Jewish intelligence - can be spotted on Tony Podesta birthday, just behind/beside James Alefantis, at least two times, here's 53 weeks before James Instagram archive was made (November 2016) meaning birthday is near end of October 2015<br>

<br>
And here's my quote from another thread, Gerson family are linked to production of the occult movie (Automatic at Sea) with themes of the occult, what looks like a cult, and secret pizza.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Additionally to Alice Waters, there are also parents of David Henry Gerson - Allan Gerson and Joan Nathan Gerson mentioned in credits of the Automatic at Sea occult movie, they are thanked when it comes to locations - we know they settled there on Martha's Vineyard so it makes sense.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hasidism or Chasidism was a 17th-20th century Eastern European Jewish movement emphasizing feeling over intellect (compared to normative, legalistic Judaism). There were, however, earlier movements called Hasidic in Western Europe (i.e. Germany) sometimes referred to as Ashkenazi Hasidism. The movement in question, however, was started by the Baal Shem Tov (acronym = Besht) or Master of the Good Name. There are many magical tales about the Besht and his disciples (see books by Martin Buber, Aryeh Kaplan, and Elie Wiesel). Moshe Idel is a fine writer. His most famous work (taking issue with Scholem in a number of issues) is "Kabbalah: New Perspectives." Idel has no problem creating his own ideas and innovations. He has also written an impressive trilogy of works about the great ecstatic Kabbalistic master, Abraham Abulafia ("Language, Torah, and Hermaneutics in Abraham Abulafia," "The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia," and "Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah"). They are worth reading--especially the last one. Thus, Idel has delved deeply into ecstatic mysticism. ..</div></blockquote>

<br>
Idel has undertaken a systematic revision of the history and analysis of Jewish mysticism. His explorations of the mythical, theurgical, mystical, and messianic dimensions of Judaism have been attentive to history, sociology, and anthropology, while rejecting a naïve historicist approach to Judaism.[4] His 1988 work, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (Yale University Press), is said to have revolutionised Kabbalah studies.[5] His historical and phenomenological studies of rabbinic, philosophic, kabbalistic, and Hasidic texts have transformed the understanding of Jewish intellectual history and highlighted the close relationship between magic, mysticism, and liturgy.[4] He is also a three-time fellow at the <span style="color:#FF0040">University of Pennsylvania's Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies</span>.</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>According to Gershom Scholem, “the activities of these migrants <br>
strengthened the Kabbalah, which acquired many adherents in Italy in the <br>
fourteenth	and	fi	fteenth	centuries.”2<br>
 Laying the basis for the rediscovery of the <br>
occult tradition of classical philosophy was, as Moshe Idel, one of the foremost <br>
scholars of the subject, has pointed out that “Kabbalah was conceived by both <br>
Jewish and Christian Renaissance	fi	gures	as	an	ancient	theology,	similar	to	and,	<br>
according to the Jews, the source of such later philosophical developments as <br>
Platonism, Aristotelianism, Pythagoreanism, and atomism.”3</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>While commonly conceived as a religious cause, Zionism began as a secular <br>
movement. As the father of Reform Judaism, Moses Mendelssohn founded the <br>
culture of Jewish secularism, which also opened the way for the development <br>
of Zionism. According to Gershom Scholem, and later Jacqueline Rose, as <br>
outlined in The Question of Zion, Zionism derived from Sabbateanism.86 According <br>
to Scholem,	 “Sabbateanism	 is	 the	 matrix	 of	 every	 signifi	cant	 movement	 to	<br>
have emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, from Hasidism, to <br>
Reform Judaism, to the earliest Masonic circles and revolutionary idealism. The <br>
Sabbatean ‘believers’ felt that they were champions of a new world which was to <br>
be established by overthrowing the values of all positive religions.”87<br>
It was Rabbi Antelman, in To Eliminate the Opiate, who pointed out that <br>
the Frankists introduced Sabbateanism on a large-scale to Judaism principally <br>
through the Reform and Conservative movements, as well as Zionist-leaning <br>
organizations like the American Jewish Congress, the World Jewish Congress <br>
and the B’nai B’rith, which was initially a branch of Freemasonry.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Freud, when he was made aware of the Kabbalah of Isaac Luria apparently <br>
exclaimed, “This is gold!” and asked why these ideas had never previously been <br>
brought to his attention.22 Carl Jung, who had worked with Freud, commented <br>
approvingly of the Jewish mystical origins of Freudian psychoanalysis, stating <br>
that in order to comprehend the origin of Freud’s theories:<br>
…one would have to take a deep plunge into the history of the <br>
Jewish mind. This would carry us beyond Jewish Orthodoxy into the <br>
subterranean workings of Hasidism… and then into the intricacies of <br>
the Kabbalah, which still remains unexplored psychologically.23<br>
Freud’s theories were excessively concerned with sex and even incest, <br>
which	 is	 refl	ected	 in	 Sabbatean antinomianism. As Gershom Scholem noted, <br>
the Sabbateans were particularly obsessed with upturning prohibitions against <br>
sexuality, particularly those against incest, as the Torah lists thirty-six prohibitions <br>
that are punishable by “extirpation of the soul,” half of them against incest. <br>
Baruchya Russo (Osman Baba), who in about the year 1700 was the leader of <br>
the most radical wing of the Sabbateans in Salonika	and	who	directly	infl	uenced	<br>
Jacob Frank, not only declared these prohibitions abrogated but went so far as <br>
to transform their contents into commandments of the new “Messianic Torah.”</div></blockquote>

From David Livingstone's "Black Terror White Soldiers"<br>
<br>
Also the founder of Hasidism's descendant today is a tranny rabbi who justifies trannyism via the Kabbalah and Bible.  presumably the whole notion is from the "shekhinah" "female aspect of God" (Lurianic idea) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekhinah" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekhinah</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>According to Gershom Scholem, "The introduction of this idea was one of the most important and lasting innovations of Kabbalism. ...no other element of Kabbalism won such a degree of popular approval."[28] The "feminine Jewish divine presence, the shekhinah, distinguishes Kabbalistic literature from earlier Jewish literature."[29] </div></blockquote>

It was Pamela Cafritz who established concept of slavery in NXIVM:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Prior to her passing,<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"> Miss Cafritz established the concept of slavery among the women who were united in slavery to Mr. Raniere</span></strong>. Despite being the topmost harem member, Miss Cafritz acted as slave to some of women in the harem.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://frankreport.com/2017/06/11/part-9-branded-slaves-and-master-raniere-allison-mack-replaces-the-late-pam-cafritz-at-top-of-the-harem/" class="postlink">https://frankreport.com/2017/06/11/part ... the-harem/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Cafritz's Life Before NXIVM <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cafritz was the daughter of Washington socialites Buffy and William Cafritz</span></strong>. In old footage featured in the docuseries, Raniere and Cafritz describe meeting at a ski trip when they were younger. Cafritz became closely involved with Raniere in the '90s when he launched Consumers' Buyline Inc. When the government accused CBI of being a pyramid scheme, she and Karen Unterreiner signed a consent agreement with prosecutors admitting their roles in CBI.<br>
<br>
Cafritz's Complicity in NXIVM's Dark SideWhen Raniere started NXIVM, Cafritz cofounded Jness, a women's group in NXIVM that focussed on how gender influences women's roles in society and their relationships. Before her death, not only did Cafritz support Raniere as a business and romantic partner, but she also enabled his sketchy dealings. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cafritz has been brought up often by "Daniela," an undocumented woman who was a DOS slave kept in a house against her will for two years.</span></strong> When Daniela became impregnated by Raniere, Cafritz guided her through an abortion at a doctor's office. Daniela believes that Cafritz's role was to shield Raniere from liability, that she was "the defuser of bombs" who would "neutralise others.<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cafritz's complicit behaviour can also be traced back to the '90s during Raniere's CBI days. According to The Times Union, she reportedly hired a 12-year-old girl to walk her dog, encourageing the girl to visit the townhouse she shared with Raniere. Later, Raniere raped the underage victim, whose mother worked for his company. He allegedly had around 60 sexual encounters with her. Two years later, in 1993, the girl reported the abuse to the police. She eventually signed a waiver saying that the claim that Raniere had sex with her was true but that she wouldn't press charges.</span></strong></div></blockquote>

<br>
At this point we should easily see the pattern. Cafritzes are powerful DC Jewish family with members connected to James Alefantis, his friends and Maccoby family (I wrote about this here: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2056" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2056</a>) ... who are another DC based influential Jewish family ... and are connected strongly with Gerson family, yet another influential Jewish family. Not to mention around this circle we can spot Rothschilds (banking dynasty, Epstein/Bronfman/Alefantis/Clintons/Abramovic connected) and Bronfmans (NXIVM/Epstein connected) multiple connections through different organizations, people and social events.</div>
