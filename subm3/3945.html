<a href="https://nwobroadcastcorp.wordpress.com/2020/04/25/the-magnificent-sassoons-and-their-opium-wars/" class="postlink">https://nwobroadcastcorp.wordpress.com/ ... pium-wars/</a><br>
<br>
India has had many famous and infamous criminals and crooks but one of the most underreported and devious of them is not even Indian He was a Bhagdadi Jew called David Sassoon<br>
<br>
David Sassoon was born in Baghdad, Iran in 1792. His father, Saleh Sassoon, was a wealthy banker and the treasurer to Ahmet Pasha, the governor of Baghdad (Thus making him the “court Jew” – a highly influential position) In 1829 Ahmet was overthrown due to corruption and the Sassoon family fled to Bombay(Mumbai), India.<br>
<br>
In Mumbai, David Sassoon  did a Rothschild and sent his eight sons all over India Indo China and China He built the international business called David S. Sassoon, with the policy of staffing it with people brought from Baghdad. They filled the functions of the various branches of his business in India, Burma, Malaya, and east Asia. In each branch, he maintained a rabbi.<br>
<br>
In the beginning, David Sassoon wanted to trade cotton cloth with China in exchange for tea, but the Chinese did not want the cotton that Sassoon wanted to trade.At the same time, Britain had an insatiable appetite for Chinese tea, but the Qing Dynasty and its subjects did not want to buy anything that the British produced.<br>
<br>
The Chinese were, however, willing to trade tea for silver, since at that time China had a currency fully backed by silver. But the government of Queen Victoria did not want to use up the country’s reserves of gold or silver in buying tea.However, Sassoon considered that the Chinese might be susceptible to opium, which could then be exchanged for tea.<br>
<br>
Armed with this knowledge, he sailed back to England to make a new proposition to the Queen. And, on the advice of David Sassoon, Queen Victoria decided to export opium from the Indian Subcontinent to China where her military would enforce its importation and use.<br>
<br>
In Order to boost the trade David Sassoon forced the farmers in Bengal to stop farming food and turn to growing opium poppies. This change in cropping patterns was to have disastrous consequences later for Bihar Bengal and Uttar Pradesh  The climate in Bengal was very good for growing opium and Sassoon’s business flourished. He became a MEMBER OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY, A FIRM OWNED AND RUN BY JEWS(a fact few Indians know even now ) out of the City of London. So successful was the opium business that the tax the East Indian Company paid to England paid for all English wars between 1831 and 1905.<br>
<br>
Sassoon’s sons were busy pushing this mind-destroying drug in Canton, China, and their trade expanded alarmingly. Between 1830 – 1831 they trafficked 18,956 chests of opium earning millions of dollars. Part of the profits went to Queen Victoria and the British government. In the year 1836 the trade increased to over 30,000 chests and drug addiction in coastal cities became endemic.<br>
<br>
By 1880 it had skyrocketed to 105,508 chests, making the Sassoons the richest Jews in the world next to the Rothschild’s.The Sassoons were now licensing opium dens in each British occupied area with large fees being collected by their Jewish agents.Pretty soon the Rothschild’s and Sassoons were tied in marriage when one of  Davids many grandsons  Sir Edward Albert Sassoon (1856 – 1912), the son of Albert, married Aline Caroline de Rothschild,<br>
<br>
And many of these Jewish agents were the Chinese Jews of Kaifeng.These Jews had immigrated to China along the Silk Road hundreds of years ago and had so intermarried with the Chinese that they looked entirely Chinese.But they still were practicing Jews and were thus the perfect Chinese agents for the Sassoons.The entire trade was controlled by Jewish families only. Sassoon would not allow any other race to engage in “the Jews’ business” of importing and selling opium.Opium was strictly a Jewish monopoly, but these Jews were working under British passports.The corrupt British monarchy honored them with privilege and knighthood – to the disgrace of the Crown.<br>
<br>
IN SHORT THE MAGNIFICENT SASSOONS MADE TONNES OF MONEY AS  OPIUM DRUGLORDS  SCREWED  BOTH INDIA AND CHINA ALL THE WHILE USING BRITISH TROOPS AND SAILORS  ……….JEHOVA MUST HAVE BEEN PLEASED</div>
