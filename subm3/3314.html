<br>
<br>
<br>
Dr Peter McCullough reveals the Covid-19 Vacc are Bioweapons and a CDC whistle-blower has confirmed 50k Americans have died due to the jabs<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The most highly cited physician on the early treatment of COVID-19 has come out with an explosive new interview that blows the lid off the medical establishment’s complicity in the unnecessary deaths of thousands.<br>
<br>
Dr. Peter McCullough said these deaths have been facilitated by a false narrative bent on pushing an all-new, unproven vaccine for a disease that was highly treatable.<br>
<br>
He said the alleged Covid-19 virus is a bioweapon and the vaccines represent “phase two” of that bioweapon.<br>
<br>
“As this, in a sense, bioterrorism phase one was rolled out, it was really all about keeping the population in fear and in isolation and preparing them to accept the vaccine, which appears to be phase two of a bioterrorism operation,” .<br>
<br>
He noted:<br>
<br>
“Both the respiratory virus and the vaccine delivered to the human body the spike protein, the gain of function target of this bioterrorism research.”<br>
<br>
 “But, we had learned we could no longer communicate with gov agencies. We actually couldn’t even communicate with our propagandised colleagues in major medical centres, all of which appear to be under a spell, almost as if they are hypnotized right now.”  So sad <br>
<br>
<br>
He did not hold back in his criticism of his colleagues in the medical community.<br>
<br>
“And doctors, good doctors, are doing unthinkable things, like injecting biologically active messenger RNA that produces this pathological spike protein into pregnant women. I think when the doctors wake up from their trance they’re going to be shocked to think what they’ve done to people.”<br>
<br>
McCullough is professor of medicine and vice chief of internal medicine at Baylor Univ.   He is an epidemiologist, cardiologist and internist and has testified before the Texas State Senate related to COVID-19 treatments. He is  the most widely cited physician in the treatment of COVID-19 with more than 600 citations in the Nat’l Library of Medicine.<br>
<br>
In the interview McCullough said:<br>
<br>
“The first wave of the bioterrorism is a respiratory virus that spread across the world, and affected relatively few people—but generated great fear.”<br>
<br>
He said the virus targeted primarily people over 50 with multiple medical conditions. It poses almost no risk to children.<br>
<br>
He said 85 percent of the more than 600k U.S. deaths could have been prevented with a multi-drug treatment given in the early to mid-point of the disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The vast majority of doctors jumped in lockstep to follow these erroneous “guidelines” handed down by the World Health Org. and the U.S. Centre for Disease Control. Those guidelines neglected to place any focus on the treatment of sick patients and, started emphasizing the need for a vaccine as the only real hope.<br>
<br>
The federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS] logged 6k reports of deaths of people injected. That’s more than all the deaths reported to VAERS from all other vaccines combined over the last .<br>
<br>
“We have now a whistleblower inside the CMS, and we have two whistleblowers in the CDC. We think we have 50k dead Americans. 50k deaths. So we actually have more deaths due to the vaccine per day than certainly the viral illness by far. It’s basically propagandized bioterrorism by injection.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He said the suppression of early COVID treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine and especially Ivermectin, “was tightly linked to the development of a vaccine.”<br>
<br>
Without the suppression of the already-available treatments, the government would not have been able to legally grant Emergency Use Authorisation to the three vaccines rushed to market in the USA by Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson.<br>
<br>
In the case of Moderna, the U.S. gov is co-patent holder through the Nat’l Institutes of Health, a clear conflict of interest, and confidential documents reveal Moderna sent a coronavirus mRNA vaccine candidate was sent to a US University in December 2019, weeks before Covid-19 was allegedly known to even exist.<br>
<br>
“I published basically the only two papers that teach doctors how to treat COVID-19 at home to prevent hospitalisation and death…If treated early, it results in an 85 percent reduction in hospitalisations and death,” McCullough said.<br>
<br>
So not only were the vaccines rolled out unnecessarily by suppressing already available, effective treatments, but the FDA and CDC are now covering up tragic numbers of deaths caused by their experimental mRNA injections.<br>
<br>
McCullough said he has org groups around the world that emphasise early treatment.<br>
<br>
“Governments have actually tried to block early treatment of Covid patients...”<br>
<br>
“We broke through to the people, and the people who got sick with COVID called in to get medications from mail-order distribution pharmacies. So we crushed the epidemic here in the United States towards the end of December and January.<br>
<br>
“We basically took care of the pandemic with about 500 doctors and telemedicine services. And to this day we treat about 25 percent of the US COVID-19 population that actually are at high risk.  And we basically handled the pandemic.<br>
<br>
McCullough said his focus has recently turned to the unnecessary and dangerous injections.<br>
<br>
“We are working to change the public view of the vaccine. The public initially accepted the vaccine and we had to kind of slowly turn the ship. Now, in the U.S. the rates of vaccination have been dropping since April 8. Most of the vaccination centres are empty.<br>
<br>
“We have a lot going on in the United States. We are engaging more and more attorneys.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sadly my spouse has taken 2 injection. My son and his new wife have also. <br>

			<div class="content">Thanks for the article. If you look up the definition of a Bio weapon, corona fits all of them. My Drill instructor in basic even told us that last year when it all started. Sadly there are very few. Or at least, few who are willing to rise up against it. They claim they just want their life back. What they don't know is by taking the jab they are giving up their freedom and therefore their life in the most literal sense.  <br>
<br>
As Thomas Jefferson said: If people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny</div>
