<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Feb. 2021:<br>
<br>
The ten-year anniversary of Heinz Junkermann’s passing provides an opportunity for his friends and family to reflect on the career and personal life of the German businessman. Born in 1928 in Frankfurt, Heinz developed a successful career across different business sectors before marrying Ingrid Junkermann and becoming father to his daughter Nicole in 1980. He made significant contributions to post-war Germany, beginning in the 1960s as he built a series of businesses within the real estate, jewellery and <span style="color:#FF0040">most importantly private banking sectors.</span> <br>
<br>
Though Junkermann’s most significant business venture was his launch of a private bank for high-net-worth clients, his involvement in real estate company IFG Gesellschaft für Immobilienbesitz mbH and the jewellery company Schmuck-Kassette GmbH represent a legacy that lives on in his investor daughter, Nicole Junkermann.  ...
</div></blockquote>
Then the article just goes on about Nicole herself, what a fabulous investor she is, blah blah blah...<br>
<br>
I found the article interesting because I have been looking for information on her family for years. But it had been carefully hidden.. now we have a charm offensive... as Nicole has been linked to the UK's former Health Minister Matt Hancock's Healthtech Advisory Board and many people were asking questions about what what she was doing there we now have an onslaught of PR articles... why Heinz suddenly even has his own Wiki page.. note that all the references there are from this year.....<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">This article is about Paul Desmarais senior. For his son, see Paul Desmarais Jr.<br>
</em><br>
<br>
Paul Desmarais Sr. PC CC OQ (January 4, 1927 – October 8, 2013) was a Canadian financier and philanthropist, based in Montreal. With an estimated family net worth of US$4.5 billion (as of March 2012), Desmarais was ranked by Forbes as the fourth wealthiest person in Canada and 235th in the world in 2013.[2] He was chairman and chief executive officer of Power Corporation of Canada until 1996 when he passed the reins of management of Power Corporation to his sons, Paul Jr. and André. He then continued to serve as a director and as chairman of the executive committee of the board, and remained the controlling shareholder. Power Corporation of Canada is a diversified international management and holding company with interests in companies in the financial services, asset management, sustainable and renewable energy, and other business sectors....<br>
<br>
Power Corporation of Canada<br>
Taking advantage of the substantial investment of Power Corporation of Canada, Desmarais took control of a large pulp and paper company, Consolidated Bathurst (built since in Stone-Consolidated, then merged with Abitibi-Price Inc. to form Abitibi-Consolidated, then Abitibi-Bowater and Resolute). At the same time, under the leadership of Desmarais, Power Corporation of Canada continued to acquire control positions in Great-West Life and Investors Group which formed the basis of Power Financial Corporation which was founded in 1984.[19] Acquiring Trans-Canada Corporation Fund, Desmarais obtained the newspaper La Presse in 1968, which enabled him to gain experience in the field of print media in Canada. Then he looked for companies in Europe and he met the <span style="color:#FF0040">Belgian financier Albert Frère</span> to the board of directors of Paribas. The two men discovered an alter ego, applying the same financial techniques: a friendly investment in substantial firms, some of which were experiencing financial hardship. Desmarais owned about 15% of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, a Belgian holding company, which in 2001 acquired a 25% interest in the German media company<span style="color:#FF0040"> Bertelsmann</span>, whose subsidiaries include BMG and Random House (the German company Bertelsmann bought the 25% back in July 2006). Groupe Bruxelles Lambert currently holds positions in global industrial and services companies based in Europe including: Imerys, LafargeHolcim, <span style="color:#FF0040">adidas</span>, SGS, Pernod Ricard, Umicore, Ontex, GEA and Parques..<br>
<br>
The Desmarais family enjoys connections to politicians worldwide. Critics charge that the family's political connections provide it with unfair advantages in business.[21]<br>
<br>
According to a profile in The Australian, "Desmarais grew to command the intersection of Canadian business and politics through close relations with four prime ministers."[22] <span style="color:#FF0040">Desmarais was an advisor to Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.</span>[22] Brian Mulroney worked as a labour lawyer for Desmarais before entering politics, and Desmarais named his then-employee Paul Martin as president of <span style="color:#FF0040">Canada Steamship Lines Inc. (Power Corp.'s Great Lakes shipping subsidiary)</span> in 1974 (Desmarais sold the company to Martin in 1981.)[22] Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was related to Desmarais by marriage; Chretien's daughter France is married to Desmarais' son André.[22] <span style="color:#FF0000">Both Mulroney and Trudeau served on advisory boards for Power Corp. after leaving office</span>..<br>
<br>
According to Le Figaro, Paul Desmarais Sr. was a close associate of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. Paul Desmarais Sr. and Sarkozy were together at the party at Fouquet's to celebrate the election of the new president on May 6, 2007.[23] In 2004, Nicolas Sarkozy was a guest at his estate in Sagard, in Charlevoix, a good distance from the Saint Lawrence. «Quand tu entres dans la propriété, on t'ouvre un premier portail. Ensuite, tu dois faire des kilomètres et des kilomètres avant d'arriver au château...» ("When you enter the property, they open the first gate. Then you have to go kilometers and kilometers before arriving at the chateau...") Nicolas Sarkozy told about the fortitude of his friend Desmarais.[24] Sophie Desmarais' ex-husband, Eric Le Moyne de Sérigny, is also close to Nicolas Sarkozy, heads numerous companies, and was a member of the board of directors of Imerys...<br>
<br>
Many testimonials were shared around the time of his death and the ceremony:<br>
<br>
- <span style="color:#FF0040">George H. W. Bush</span>: “Paul was that rarest of men, who possess not only the drive, the integrity and the vision to succeed spectacularly in business, but also a tremendous capacity for friendship. He was what I would call <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">a true point of light</span></span>, helping and usually leading many worthwhile causes. So, yes, I liked and I respected this good man immensely. At age 89 and a half, I recognize more than ever the importance and the blessings of friendship.”

..André Desmarais is a Canadian business leader and well-known philanthropist. He is president and co-chief executive officer of Power Corporation of Canada, and was instrumental in building the financial success of Power Corporation. Mr. Desmarais was one of the first Canadian business executives to advocate and lead in the establishment of closer ties between Canada and China.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2012:<br>
<br>
French police on Tuesday raided the home and offices of Nicolas Sarkozy, but the recently defeated president of France was nowhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
That’s because, according to news reports, he was in the Charlevoix region, north of Montreal, vacationing with one of Canada’s most influential families. Sarkozy is vacationing at Sagard, the palatial home of Paul Desmarais, Sr., owner of Canada's Power Corp.<br>
<br>
Sarkozy is being investigated over allegations he took illegal campaign donations from<span style="color:#FF0040"> Lilliane Bettencourt, the 90-year-old heiress to the $23.5-billion L’Oreal cosmetics fortune and France’s richest woman.</span><br>
<br>
It’s long been known that Desmarais, Canada’s fourth-richest person by one count, and seventh-richest person by another count, has long been a close friend of the French ex-president, but the campaign finance scandal touching Sarkozy touches people linked to the Desmarais clan as well.<br>
<br>
One of Desmarais’ daughters, <span style="color:#FF0040">Sophie, is the former wife of Eric Le Moyne de Sérigny</span>, whose name has surfaced in the scandal now engulfing Sarkozy. Their marriage ended a decade ago, according to news sources.<br>
<br>
An asset manager and investment banker, <span style="color:#FF0040">De Sérigny was an adviser to Eric Woerth</span>, a former French budget minister under Sarkozy who was implicated in the scandal. Woerth is under investigation. [In 2015 the charges ere dropped.]<br>
<br>
Serigny sits on the board of Imerys, a mining company partly owned by a subsidiary of Power Corp., the company owned by Desmarais.<br>
<br>
In 2010, a former accountant for Bettencourt alleged that French politicians commonly received large amounts of cash while visiting Bettencourt’s home, in violation of French law. Sarkozy is alleged to have received as much as EURO 150,000 in unsolicited donations. The limit for campaign donations by individuals in France is EURO 4,600.<br>
<br>
The scandal simmered on the back burner during Sarkozy’s years in the Elysee Palace, but when he lost the election on June 15, clearing the way for current President Francois Hollande, Sarkozy’s presidential immunity ended.<br>
<br>
The links between Sarkozy and the Desmarais family go back to well before the Bettencourt scandal. Desmarais has reportedly known Sarkozy since the mid-1990s, and, during a visit to Canada in 2008, Sarkozy said that Desmarais was one of the reasons he had become president of France.<br>
<br>
"If I am president now, I owe that part to the advice, friendship and loyalty of Paul Desmarais," he reportedly said.<br>
<br>
Sarkozy said he had spent 10 days in 1995 with the Canadian business magnate, at the same Desmarais property north of Montreal, and came to feel so close to Desmarais that he felt “like a family member -- except for the inheritance, of course.”<br>
<br>
Desmarais’ proximity to Sarkozy may have actually changed French policy towards Canada. While France had kept a neutral position on Quebec independence for decades after Charles De Gaulle’s “Vive le Quebec” comments in 1967, that policy changed under Sarkozy. The French president made it clear he wanted Quebec to remain in Canada.<br>
<br>
Some observers say that position was due to Desmarais’ influence. Desmarais is known as a firm federalist who once reportedly said, “If Quebec separates from Canada, that’s my end.”<br>
<br>
Desmarais is considered one of Canada's most influential entrepreneurs. No fewer than three former prime ministers -- Jean Chretien, Paul Martin and Brian Mulroney -- have worked for Power Corp. The online activist group Anonymous released a video in May showing Desmarais' connections to Canadian politicians.<br>
<br>
The Montreal Gazette reports that Sarkozy will “spend a few days” at the Desmarais compound.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Just thought I'd throw this article in here before I forget as there has been some speculation that Nicole Junkermann was involved in the Chinese Communist Party's Big Brother app:<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">Are Urban School Systems Giving Away Staff and Students DNA?</span> <a href="https://teachersforchoice.org/2021/07/23/are-urban-school-systems-giving-away-staff-and-students-dna" class="postlink">https://teachersforchoice.org/2021/07/2 ... udents-dna</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In both New York City and Philadelphia the public school systems signed contracts for in-school COVID testing with laboratories that ‘coincidentally’ own large proprietary catalogues of DNA specimens.<br>
<br>
In NYC the contracted laboratory is Fulgent Genetics. Through the courts and freedom of information requests, we were able to get legal guarantees that specimens from COVID testing will be destroyed and used for nothing but a positive or negative COVID result.<br>
<br>
In Philadelphia the schools have contracted Thermo Fischer Scientific, a laboratory that is known to have given “free health screenings” to children in China for the hidden purpose of cataloguing their DNA specimens. They also maintain a DNA database that every police department in America has access to (supporting documentation provided below).<br>
<br>
Is it just a coincidence that 2 of the largest cities on the east coast have partnered with major laboratories that own DNA catalogues to collect specimens for in-school COVID testing? What about the other major cities in America? Los Angeles? San Francisco? Chicago? Who has been contracted to execute those in-school COVID testing contracts? Is it also, coincidentally, a laboratory that owns a large proprietary catalogue of DNA specimens? This is an open question that I hope a journalist of integrity will pick up the ball and run with.<br>
<br>
I’m just a teacher.<br>
<br>
New York City<br>
<br>
TEACHERS FOR CHOICE has sued NYC Schools over privacy rights of specimens taken from staff and students during in-school COVID testing, and we won. In our case KANE vs. NYC DOE, we ultimately won a court ordered stipulation forbidding Fulgent Genetics, or any NYC DOE contractor, from utilizing collected specimens for anything other than getting a positive or negative COVID result. After winning in court, we still did not get to see the governing contract; it remained secret. When we finally uncovered the governing contract through a freedom of information request, it revealed Fulgent was never required to destroy any of the specimens they collected.<br>
<br>
Glad we got our court-ordered stipulation!<br>
<br>
Philadelphia<br>
<br>
In Philadelphia, teacher Neal Follman has uncovered that the lab contracted for in-school COVID testing in the public schools, Thermo Fischer Scientific, is creating its own DNA database accessible to every police department in the country. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#FF0040">Thermo Fischer has also harvested DNA from Chinese children through “free heath screenings.” In addition to this they have played a key role in the detention and tracking of the Muslim minority Uighers and other dissidents many who are in Chinese concentration camps. The lab has also partnered with Bode Technologies, a private company run by CIA interests</span></strong> (supporting documentation below).<br>
<br>
Follman has asked to see the contracts that govern Thermo Fischer’s in-school COVID testing program in Philadelphia schools. While some of the contracts have been provided, others still remain secret. (This is exactly the same nonsense we dealt with in NYC which forced us to retain attorneys). Follman was recently fired for refusing to sign the in-school COVID testing consent form in Philadelphia public schools. Below is brilliant research from Neal Follman documenting the shady reality surrounding Thermo Fischer Scientific. This comes from Follman’s 16 page rebuttal to Philadelphia’s Labor Relations Department on why he was unfairly and illegally fired from his teaching position in Philly.<br>
<br>
....  Why did the Philadelphia Police Department allocate money to Thermo Fisher Scientific for “lab equipment”?  And if your immediate reaction is to label this question as speculation, I ask that you look at the information provided in number 4.  I also would encourage you to investigate the PPD Forensic Director’s (Mike Garvey) ties to the CIA....<br>
<br>
WHY ARE WE GIVING CONTRACTS TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE ASSISTED IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES SINCE 2017?  <br>
<br>
Thermo Fisher Scientific has supplied, “[T]echnologies to ‘severely limit the freedoms of movement, expression, and religion’ of the ethnic minority Uyghur population of western China. China has detained an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in ‘political education centers,’ including over a dozen family members of U.S.-based Radio Free Asia (RFA) Uyghur Service journalists.” <a href="https://www.cecc.gov/media-center/press-releases/chairs-ask-commerce-secretary-ross-about-sale-of-surveillance-technology" class="postlink">https://www.cecc.gov/media-center/press ... technology</a><br>

<br>
.. <span style="color:#FF0040">“[H]uman rights groups have expressed alarm that such data could be employed to track down Uighurs who do not cooperate with the government. For example, the DNA could be used to predict an individual’s facial features, images of which the government could compile in ‘mass surveillance and facial recognition systems that it is building.’”  Also of note is the quotation that has haunted me since I found it in April: ‘“The Chinese government’s intrusive surveillance of its population, including the collection of biometric data, is not confined solely to Xinjiang. Throughout the country, police have taken individuals’ DNA samples by offering “free health checks” or by simply taking saliva samples from schoolchildren. Chinese public security officials aim to have 100 million DNA records in their national database before the end of this year.</span></div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 2015, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Public Security Bureau announced it planned to purchase equipment from the <span style="color:#FF0040">U.S.-based biotechnology company Promega</span> for the purpose of analyzing DNA and adding it to a national database, according to Chinese government procurement documents.<br>
<br>
The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, colloquially known as the Bingtuan, is a quasi-colonial enterprise under the dual leadership of the central government and the government of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. With over 2.7 million members, the Bingtuan is “a vast farming militia” that operates many of the region’s largest agricultural and resource extraction industries that can also be called upon to support the military or police in an emergency.  In theory subordinate to the local government, in practice the Bingtuan, originally founded under the auspices of the Chinese military, maintains completely independent administrative and judicial institutions. As part of its mission, the Bingtuan is tasked with increasing the regional population of China’s national ethnic majority Han in relation to local ethnicities like the Uighurs. It also works to “cultivate and guard [China’s] border areas.”<br>
<br>
Previous purchases of DNA analysis equipment by public security authorities in Xinjiang have raised outcry in recent years because human rights experts worry it could be employed in the surveillance and persecution of Uighurs. Since 2017, authorities throughout the region have interned over one million Uighur and other ethnic minority Muslims in what they euphemistically refer to as “vocational training centers.” Various government entities manage individual internment camps, depending on the facility in question. Regional government procurement documents show that the Bingtuan itself operates some of the camps.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Chinese authorities, led by Xinjiang’s Office of Population Service and Management and Real-Name Registration Work Leadership Committee, are collecting and analyzing the DNA of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities throughout the region. Though the ultimate aim of this collection is not yet clear, human rights groups have expressed alarm that such data could be employed to track down Uighurs who do not cooperate with the government. For example, the DNA could be used to predict an individual’s facial features, images of which the government could compile in “mass surveillance and facial recognition systems that it is building.”..<br>
