WILLY BAD Actor in bare-bottomed monkey costume with fake penis appears at event to encourage children to read <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15566434/actor-bare-bottomed-fake-penis-monkey-kids-event/" class="postlink">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15566434/ ... ids-event/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>12 July 2021:<br>
<br>
AN actor in a bare-bottomed monkey costume with fake penis appeared at an event to encourage children to read. Worried mums and dads complained after snaps appeared online of the rainbow-coloured character at a event.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/hu72w0.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

It was part of the Redbridge Libraries Summer Reading Challenge run by Redbridge Council in East London.<br>
<br>
One parent said: “Someone needs to lose their job over this.”<br>
<br>
A second asked: “This is unbelievable. Have we completely lost our moral compass as a society?” <br>
<br>
Redbridge Libraries apologised for the “inappropriate” costume.
</div></blockquote>

That 'actor' came from a company called Mandinga Arts which has gone into damage control, locked down their website and scrubbed stuff from the web. <br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It would appear not, this is grooming in plain sight, Mandinga Arts are obviously aware since they have deleted all the photos similar to this from their website, of men displaying dildos and fake buttocks smirking next to children.

Boris Johnson was photographed with monkey man in 2008 when he was Mayor of London <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15595735/boris-johnson-rainbow-monkey-fake-penis/?rec_article=true" class="postlink">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15595735/ ... ticle=true</a><br>
<br>
Mandinga Arts. <span style="color:#FF0040">British and Colombian artists Charles Beauchamp and Julieta Rubio</span> trained as painter?printmakers and have had regular solo exhibitions in London. For the last 20 years they have designed and created award-winning giant puppets, costumes, masks and floats for carnivals, festivals, community projects and theatre. <a href="https://ivangonzalez.photoshelter.com/image/I0000MclkYnm4a1k" class="postlink">https://ivangonzalez.photoshelter.com/i ... clkYnm4a1k</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mandinga Arts was founded by Julieta Rubio and Charles Beauchamp in 2002, in response to a clear need for artists to work together on performance opportunities – to practice, improve, educate, share and promote carnival arts.

So, I went looking for more company info: <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06026004/officers" class="postlink">https://find-and-update.company-informa ... 4/officers</a>#  No Julieta Rubio or Charles Beauchamp listed but I did find a Charles Gimpel and Julieta Gimpel listed at the company's official address.<br>
<br>
And that's when I found the spooks story of the Gimpel family... <span style="color:#00FF40">Kay &amp; Charles Gimpel  -They fell in love at 1 Dorset Square </span><a href="https://www.alliancefrancaise.london/Kay-and-Charles-Gimpel.php" class="postlink">https://www.alliancefrancaise.london/Ka ... Gimpel.php</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...Kay was a British citizen born in Canada in 1914 of Irish parentage (her father was a major in WWI), who went to Paris in 1936 to study international relations until she abandoned the course and travelled in Europe. When war broke out, she was back in Paris, working in the British Embassy. As Brig. William Fraser for whom she worked in the military attachés office put it in a reference letter, “in that capacity she was in touch with secret matters. I consider her entirely reliable and discreet, and have a high opinion of her energy and capacity. […] She is an expert on filing and general office routine.”<br>
<br>
She left France in a hurry in May 1940. Once in London, Kay held two jobs before joining SOE. She worked at the War Office, employed by MI5, then at Canada House, “coding and deciphering”, and as an official there wrote, “doing confidential work in our Cypher and De-cypher Department, where discretion, accuracy and industry are required. It gives me great pleasure to say that she has shown all these qualities while she has been with us.” She started work for SOE on 1st April 1941. Once in place, Kay, ever the organiser, got her Paris colleague and friend Mary a job in the Firm, and arranged for them and another girl working for MI5 to share a townhouse in Knightsbridge...<br>
<br>
..Part of Kay’s job, like all RF staff, was to ease the agents’ pre-mission jitters, by making them laugh and lots of cups of tea. Her sunny personality was such that she knew everybody and everything in the organisation, was in contact with many agents and other exiles, and parties at her home (unbeknownst to SOE) were famous among them. She was close to a number of them but when she met<span style="color:#FF0040"> Ernest Gimpel</span>, it was love at first sight. The coup de foudre happened at 1 Dorset Square, as she was giving his codes to this dashing cavalry officer, now Charles Beauchamp, a special agent. They dated and got engaged before he left....<br>
<br>
A party at Kay’s: Charles, with brother Peter on his right, and Canadian war artist <span style="color:#FF0040">Will Ogilvie</span>. Charles and Kay <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/ehtnpm.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/ehtnpm.jpg</a><br>
<br>
..Ernest Gimpel was born in 1913 in France. His father, René Gimpel, was a renowned French art dealer. His mother, Florence Duveen was part of English aristocracy, and sister of influential art dealer Sir Joseph Duveen. Ernest had two brothers: Peter, two years his junior, and Jean, five years younger...<br>
<br>
..In August 1943, he received a Grade A in his paramilitary training, showing a good standard in use of weapons, a quick and aggressive approach to close combat, and very good knowledge (in theory and practice) of explosives and demolitions...As the name Gimpel was too well-known, or his connection to British aristocracy, he took the nom de guerre of <span style="color:#FF0040">Charles Beauchamp</span>. He would use the christian name Charles for the rest of his life, becoming <span style="color:#FF0040">Charles Gimpel </span>to everybody. He was parachuted into France on 25 November 1943. His false papers were in the name of Charles Henri Blanc, civil servant, domiciled in Vichy. The reality was that he was joining the Military Delegate (DMR) to the Paris region, André Boulloche (codename SEGMENT) to be his deputy. Their job was to liaise with the local resistance leaders, coordinate and facilitate their actions by distributing British arms and materiel.<br>

</div></blockquote>

Charles Beauchamp? Charles Gimpel? You can read the rest of the story at the link.  Ernest and Kay were spooks. They were also the parents of the Charles Gimpel, listed as a founder of the Mandinga Arts Group.<br>
<br>
Ernest Gimpel <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Gimpel" class="postlink">https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Gimpel</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ernest Gimpel (known as Charles Gimpel after the war), alias Charles Beauchamps , Cercle et Doucet , ( Vaucresson , Seine-et-Oise , France, August 5 , 1913- Cretingham , Suffolk, United Kingdom, January 26 , 1973) is a French resistance fighter, Compagnon de la Liberation , of an English mother, assigned to the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Action 1 , as well as an art dealer...<br>
<br>
Released on April 24, 1945 by the advance of the allied troops, he was repatriated to France and attached to the General Directorate of Studies and Research (DGER).<br>
<br>
He left the army with the rank of commander, and settled in England.<br>
<br>
He married there, adopted the name Charles Gimpel and until his death <span style="color:#FF0040">ran an internationally renowned painting gallery, Gimpel fils</span> , founded in 1946 with his wife Kay and his brother Pierre.<br>
<br>
Charles Gimpel was also an amateur photographer who, during six trips to the Canadian Arctic , set out to document Inuit life during the 1950s and 1960s. His work was the subject of an exhibition in Cambridge in 1992, as well as a book by Canadian historian Maria Tippett  ( fr ) 2

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Gimpel Fils was founded in 1946 by brothers Charles and Peter Gimpel and Charles’ wife Kay. They added "Fils" in homage to their father René, the dealer and collector whose journal Diary of an Art Dealer was first published in 1966.

Company info for Gimpel Fils <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/00579653/officers" class="postlink">https://find-and-update.company-informa ... 3/officers</a><br>

From that Kay and Ernest Gimpel link <a href="https://www.alliancefrancaise.london/Kay-and-Charles-Gimpel.php" class="postlink">https://www.alliancefrancaise.london/Ka ... Gimpel.php</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In London Charles was reunited with his brother Peter and in November 1946 they founded an art gallery named Gimpel Fils in honour of their father. Although both brothers were trained in the old masters, their gallery spearheaded the market for modern and contemporary British art by promoting emerging young artists. Kay was the queen of networking, armed with her rolodex.<br>
<br>
Kay never lost touch with her Canadian roots, and it was through her that Charles became interested in the Arctic. In 1953, <span style="color:#FF0040">to honour the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the Gimpel Fils art gallery hung the first show of Inuit art in London</span>.<br>
<br>
Gimpel, despite being awarded the cross of the Ordre de la Libération, is not mentioned in most books on the resistance, whether the Dictionnaire de la résistance or SOE in France. The DMRs’ work has been airbrushed from resistance history and is just beginning to resurface. Charles died prematurely, aged 59; Kay carried on at the gallery until her later years.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Jann Haworth (born 1942) is an American pop artist. A pioneer of soft sculpture, she is best known as the co-creator of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover...<br>
<br>
Haworth was born in 1942 and raised in Hollywood, California. Her mother Miriam Haworth was a distinguished ceramist, printmaker, and painter. Her father, Ted Haworth, was an Academy Award-winning art director. ..Her work was seen in Amsterdam and Milan and also was featured in the Hayward Gallery's landmark exhibition of Pop Art in 1968. That same year, she and her then-husband, Pop artist Peter Blake, won a Grammy for their album cover design of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band....<br>
<br>
In the 1970s, she and Blake were members of the Brotherhood of Ruralists, a group of artists that also included Ann and Graham Arnold, Annie and <span style="color:#FF0040">Graham Ovenden</span>, and David Inshaw.[7] In 1979 she founded and ran The Looking Glass School near Bath, Somerset, an arts-and-crafts primary and middle school. In the same year, she separated from Blake and commenced living with her present husband, the writer Richard Severy. <br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">After mounting two solo exhibitions at Gimpel fils, London, in the mid-1990s</span>, Haworth won a fellowship in 1997 to study American quilt-making. She returned to the United States and took up residence in Sundance, Utah, where she founded the Art Shack Studios and Glass Recycling Works, and co-founded the Sundance Mountain Charter School (now the Soldier Hollow Charter School)...<br>
<br>
In 2004, Haworth began work on SLC PEPPER, a 50-feet × 30-feet civic wall mural in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, representing an updated version of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover...<br>
<br>
Among the more than 100 new people included in SLC PEPPER are: Adbusters, Akira Kurosawa, Alice, Alice Walker, Annie Lennox, Banksy's Rat, B.B. King, Beastie Boys, Benicio del Toro, Billie Holiday, Björk, Bob Marley, César Chávez, Charlize Theron, Cindy Sherman, Dalai Lama, David Bowie, David Hockney, Ellen DeGeneres, Erykah Badu, Eudora Welty, Enid (Thora Birch), Eve Ensler, Felix the Cat, Frank Zappa, Frida Kahlo, Garrison Keillor, Gandhi, Mikhail Gorbachev, Gore Vidal, Guerrilla Girls, Harvey Pekar, Hedwig, Howard Zinn, Jackie Robinson, Jane Goodall, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jeff Bridges, Katharine Hepburn, Laurie Anderson, Lee Krasner, Little My and the Snork Maiden, Louise Brooks, Martin Luther King Jr., Maya Angelou, Maya Lin, Miles Davis, Mother Jones, Muddy Waters, Nelson Mandela, Pablo Picasso, Peter Gabriel, Robert Rauschenberg, Ray Charles, Richard Feynman, Rosa Parks, Samuel Beckett, Sojourner Truth, Sylvia Plath, Terry Gilliam, Tom Waits, Thom Yorke, Toni Morrison, and Tony Kushner.</div></blockquote>

Have you ever wanted to build giant puppets and take over London? Well, now's your chance, if you live in the UK. The Puppet Centre Trust looks like it's recently sprung back to life with a dynamic new Project Coordinator by the name of Emma Leishman. Watch out for that name!<br>
I now receive their news updates and there's a great workshops being organised on the 19-20 November at the Mandiga Arts Studio...<br>
<br>
..In 2012 Mandinga Arts will play a pivotal role in 2012 Cultural Olympiad project Night of Festivals which will see an impressive carnival parade in Nottingham in June and in Leicester during the July Games Opening week-end.  For more information, contact Emma Leishman at the Puppet Centre Trust here!
</div></blockquote>

Night of Festivals has changed to Liberty UK <a href="https://www.nightoffestivals.com/" class="postlink">https://www.nightoffestivals.com/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Liberty UK is a pop-up Festival exploring the themes of Freedom and Democracy, produced by ArtReach.<br>
<br>
Previously known as Night of Festivals which has a 10-year history of popping up in towns and cities across the UK celebrating themes of freedom and democracy from around the world.<br>
<br>
Liberty UK is inspired by ideas of Freedom; Democracy; Solidarity and Unity; and will bring a new approach to the values of celebrating 'Freedom and Democracy' for the new decade ahead. In response to an overwhelming shift in public discourse surrounding the immediate and palpable fragility of social and political freedoms, Liberty UK seeks to take ArtReach and it’s work a step closer to front line of democratic action and build projects and programmes that look directly at some of today's most urgent, and sometimes uncomfortable, socio-political issues.
