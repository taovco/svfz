<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pearl &amp; Dean is a British cinema advertising company, founded in 1953..  The initial staffing of Pearl &amp; Dean was by employees of Theatre Publicity and Langfords (The Rank Organisation) who followed the directors when they left to form the company upon obtaining the advertising rights in ABC Cinemas, the first time that group had accepted advertising in their cinemas.<br>
<br>
In 1966, Pearl &amp; Dean formed a subsidiary company called Radiovision Broadcast International (RBI) to represent the marketing interests of the American Broadcasting Company radio and television stations in Europe. During the same year, the company signed an exclusive contract to represent the sale of advertising time on the offshore pirate radio stations Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio. This contract with the offshore stations became mired in controversy due to lack of sales and led to the headline-making bankruptcy of the original London management company for the two offshore radio stations that had been created by a private investment group formed by <span style="color:#FF0040">Don Pierson of Eastland, Texas, USA</span>.
</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Pierson" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Pierson</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Donald Grey Pierson (October 11, 1925 – March 30, 1996) was a businessman and civic leader in Eastland, Texas. He founded the British pirate stations Wonderful Radio London, Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio during the 1960s. He also attempted to create<span style="color:#FF0040"> free ports on the islands of Tortuga, Haiti and Dominica during the 1970s</span>.<br>
....   In 1963, he established U.S. Telephonics, the world's first computer telemarketing company and together, with a number of Abilene business leaders, he founded the Abilene National Bank (now Bank One - Abilene) in 1964 and served as the chairman of the board of the bank.<br>
<br>
.In 1964, his interests took him to the UK, after reading The Dallas Morning News. The newspaper carried a report of the start-up of Radio Caroline and Radio Atlanta from ships at that time anchored off the coastline of Southeast England... The end result was Radio London, which started transmitting on 16 December 1964 from the MV Galaxy, a former World War II United States Navy US Minesweeper...Between 3 May 1966 and 13 November 1966, Pierson ran radio stations Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio from the MV Olga Patricia (later renamed MV Laissez Faire), a World War II vessel built in the USA as a supply ship. The two stations shared a studio and transmitter...<br>
<br>
..Don Pierson re-entered the world of broadcasting during 1981 when he founded radio station KVMX-FM close to his home in Eastland, Texas. ..<br>
<br>
Haitian Freeport<br>
In 1967, during the time that Don Pierson was attempting to lease the ship which had been the former homes of Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio, he received a response from the Ambassador for Haiti in Washington, DC. Don Pierson's original plan was to lease or sell the ship to the government of Haiti for it to establish two powerful 50 kW commercial radio stations aimed at American tourists visiting the old buccaneer stronghold of Tortuga island, which is located some 10 miles off the north coast of the main Haitian island of Hispaniola which is also shared by the Dominican Republic.<br>
<br>
This offer became a plan to develop the island itself as a freeport and he was asked to assist the government of Haiti to encourage business investment in that poverty-stricken land. After years of research and negotiation, Don Pierson's idea of a privately financed, privately managed free enterprise zone became a reality in 1971 when Haitian dictator François Duvalier (known as "Papa Doc") and the Haitian government entered into a 99-year contract with Don Pierson's company called <span style="color:#FF0040">Dupont Caribbean Inc.</span> This contract provided for the establishment of Freeport Tortuga... Within 18 months Don Pierson succeeded in building the island's first airport, a loading dock for seagoing vessels, a rudimentary water and sewer system, an electricity generating facility, and six miles of paved road. ..portance. the project created jobs for some 400 previously unemployed Haitians and resulted in the establishment of a small school to teach various job skills. During this period he also became Honorary Consul of the Republic of Haiti to Texas from 1969 through 1974.<br>
<br>
Tragically, the free port project came to abrupt end in 1974 when, after it was announced that Gulf Oil Corporation was contemplating investing more than $300 million to build a resort on the island, the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as "Baby Doc"), summarily expropriated the project, resulting in its collapse.<br>
<br>
A similar venture on the island of Dominica which was attempted in the wake of the failed project in Haiti, also met with disaster following governmental turmoil in Dominica...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>LAST night Richard Desmond was awarded one of the world’s highest accolades for his extraordinary generosity. And some of the top figures in entertainment and business were there to honour him...<br>
<br>
Sir Evelyn de Rothschild of the banking dynasty, a close friend and fellow philanthropist, telephoned specially from New York to express his delight...<br>
<br>
Mr Desmond first became  involved with <span style="color:#FF0040">Variety through one of its founders – his god father Dickie Pearl, chairman of the Pearl&amp;Dean advertising agency.</span>..<br>
<br>
His links with Variety led to his long involvement with Norwood, an organisation which helps the disabled and their families.<br>
<br>
“<span style="color:#FF0040">They asked for a Sunshine coach</span> so I went to investigate. I went to Ravenswood Village in Berkshire which is staffed by the disabled and was blown away by the fantastic work they do. I started fundraising for them right away.”<br>
<br>
He is now president of the charity. In 2005 he was also touched by the plight of millions of the poorest people in  Niger, West Africa, who were facing famine. He decided to donate £1million to the Disasters Emergency Committee, which was co-ordinating aid. Their response, however, did not quite match his for speed...<br>
<br>
His portfolio of charities is all-embracing, from boys clubs to Old Ben, the benevolent fund for news vendors; the child-sponsoring scheme run by World Vision to Sir Elton John’s Aids Foundation.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>#MeToo in the jewelry industry. Chopard co-boss Caroline Scheufele is said to have sexually coerced her employees. An ex-employee now files a complaint and the Chopard company in Geneva denies it..<br>
<br>
A sexual assault complaint has been filed against the co-owner of the Swiss luxury company Chopard, Caroline Scheufele, with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  - a US federal agency that deals with discrimination in the workplace. Her former public relations officer Desiree Gallas reports numerous incidents of sexual harassment in the complaint.<span style="color:#FF0040"><strong class="text-strong"> Scheufele is the "Ghislaine Maxwell" of the jewelry world</strong></span>, quoted the New York Post from the complaint. For years she had offered women employees to wealthy men to do sales.<br>
<br>
..The Chopard boss is in contact with numerous stars. Here she is posing with Elton John and his partner David Furnish. - Keystone..<br>
<br>
Gallas worked for Chopard between 2014 and 2019. During this time, the two women solicited potential buyers at film industry events and hotspots in New York. <span style="color:#FF0040">Scheufele would have engaged sexually with customers several times and asked Gallas to do the same.</span><br>
<br>
Gallas, dismayed by the rapprochement<br>
<br>
The co-owner would have let herself be fondled openly during a business lunch in 2017. Gallas was taken aback by the situation. The customer then wanted to kiss her too. "I didn't feel safe," she writes in the complaint...<br>
<br>
Caroline Scheufele and her brother Karl-Friedrich, both co-bosses of Chopard, both highly reputable "Swabian" business people, as it is called<br>
On another occasion, Gallas was wearing a luxury company's necklace, which caused a customer to get inappropriately close to her. When she complained to her boss, she fired back. You should do everything to handle a sale, reports the New York Post.<br>
<br>
Caroline Scheufele and Harvey Weinstein, best friend ever!<br>
<br>
Caroline Scheufele, Harvey Weinstein, best friend ever! In March 2020, Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape. He was the trigger for the #MeToo movement worldwide<br>
Scheufele was out and about with the film producer Harvey Weinstein at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. At that time he was already accused of rape. Gallas feared for her safety and avoided Weinstein. In March 2020, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape.<br>
<br>
Desiree Gallas, former Chopard public relations officer, got the ball rolling, did she do it out of hurt pride, or are the allegations true? The court was to clarify this.<br>
Gallas alleges in the complaint that Chopard has a long-lasting “sex for dollars” workplace culture . She is also suing her former employer for emotional compensation. After filing a written complaint, Gallas was fired in August 2019.<br>
<br>
Chopard denies allegations<br>
<br>
Caroline Scheufele declined to comment, as reported by the New York Post. The luxury company called Gallas in a statement as a "disgruntled employee". She was fired for important reasons, now she wants to enrich herself financially and damage the company. Scheufele was named a respected industry leader known for her professionalism.<br>
<br>
Hostess of Hollywood's a-ranks<br>
<br>
Scheufele's family comes from Baden-Württemberg, where they owned the Eszeha watch manufacturer. In 1963 the family bought the watch company Chopard and from then on commuted between Germany and Switzerland. Scheufele attended the International School in Geneva and after graduating began to work in the parents' company...<br>
<br>
In 1998 Scheufele was invited to redesign the Palme d'or. For fifty years the festival winners received a Plexiglas pyramid as a prize, Scheufele has now designed a real palm made of gold. Soon Chopard was the festival's official partner, and Scheufele made a name for herself as an excellent host.<br>
<br>
While the latest films are being presented on the Cote d'Azur, it turns the seventh floor of the luxury hotel Martinez on the Croisette into its headquarters and invites directors, actresses, customers, journalists and influencers to join them.<br>
<br>
In return, they are allowed to present expensive Chopard jewelry on the red carpet. Her exclusive invitations are correspondingly popular, with the result that the American “Vogue” awarded her the title “Queen of Cannes”. Nobody expected that she would soon be associated with the darker side of Hollywood. Now a court will have to settle the matter.<br>
<br>
Up-Date AUGUST 20, 2020<br>
Inga Griese, editor-in-chief of ICON (Die Welt), speaks at ICON . Griese was constantly in Cannes and wherever Caroline Scheufele was a VIP guest. Of course, Griese is very close to the protagonists of the WWMG.<br>
<br>
UP-DATE AUGUST 30, 2020<br>
The former Bavarian government official Gisbert L. Brunner, who was supposed to have a “sideline permit” at the time, as well as the Austrian Alexander Linz, have been looking for close contact with the Scheufele family for decades in order to acquire writing and advertising contracts. Both are founding members of a controversial journalist syndicate: WWMG World Watch Media Guild.<br>
<br>
- Gisbert L. Brunner, co-owner of Uhrenkosmos.com, reports constantly about KFS, the brother of Caroline Scheufele<br>
- Alexander Linz, Buddy of KFS, the brother of Caroline Scheufele, is constantly doing KFS interviews for WatchAdvisor<br>

KFS likes to be photographed with these two men and interviewed by both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cRLc8ol5ax4" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/cRLc8ol5ax4</a><br>
<br>
UP-DATE SEPTEMBER 1, 2020<br>
Chopard's version sounds very different. At the request of TICK-TALK, the company denies the allegations. In the wording it says:<br>
<br>
“ The Chopard company and Ms. Caroline Scheufele reject all allegations made by their former employee, Ms. Desiree Gallas, in all forms. Both are available to the US judicial authorities to answer any questions and to fully restore the truth. ” Gallas had filed a complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a US federal agency with a mandate to prevent discrimination in employment and occupation to end...

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>International travel in some respects, is easier than ever before—yet it still remains complex. Governments continue to add hurdles through new and complex immigration and tax laws, visa regimes, pre-clearance and permission to travel schemes, as they seek to deliver safer journeys and stronger border controls. Moreover, delays for visas and work permits and long queues at Immigration and Customs controls are commonplace around the world.<br>
<br>
In this paper, we share and explore our own vision of the future for immigration—a new way of digital immigration control, as designed by our thought leader on immigration, Peter Graham...<br>

It leverages the new digital schemes that governments around the world are introducing. It’s an approach that blends effectiveness with security, and it explores how making digital innovations in immigration can make global travel simpler and easier.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>DARK MONEY INVESTIGATIONS..<br>
<br>
Conservatives accused of being ‘in hock’ to developers as donations from property and construction soars amid ‘cash for access’ accusations against housing secretary Robert Jenrick...<br>
<br>
The Conservatives have received more than £11 million from some of the UK’s richest property developers and construction businesses since Boris Johnson became prime minister last July, an openDemocracy investigation has found...Donations to the Tories from the property business increased significantly over the past year, with more than 120 individuals and companies connected to the sector giving money.<br>
<br>
..Details of the Conservatives’ reliance on property tycoons comes as housing secretary Robert Jenrick is under fire after admitting unlawful “apparent bias” in over-ruling local officials who rejected <span style="color:#FF0040">Tory donor Richard Desmond’</span>s £1billion Tower Hamlets housing development and fast-tracking the planning process saving the property developer £45 million.<br>
<br>
Desmond – who had sat beside Jenrick at a £900-a-head Conservative fundraiser at the Savoy Hotel in London late last year – subsequently donated £12,000 to the Conservatives.<br>
<br>
In a BBC interview defending Jenrick earlier this week, business minister Nadhim Zahawi said that voters who wanted to raise planning issues with their MPs could likewise go to a Conservative fundraiser.<br>
<br>
...Malcolm and Eddie Healey – dubbed “East Yorkshire’s richest men” in the local press -have donated £1.1 million to the Conservatives between them since July.<br>
<br>
Billionaire property developer Tony Gallagher gave the Conservatives almost three-quarters of a million pounds through his company Countywide Developments Ltd. A long-time Tory donor, Gallagher hosted David Cameron’s fiftieth birthday party at his Oxfordshire mansion in 2016.....<br>
<br>
New money<br>
openDemocracy’s analysis found a number of figures linked to the property sector have emerged as Conservative donors for the first time over the past year.<br>
<br>
Adeyheath Limited has given £260,000 since August. The property firm is controlled by <span style="color:#FF0040">Berish Berger</span>, who is the director of more than 130 companies including the London-based Greaterhaven and Makepeace Investments.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> David Gershon, founder and CEO of Empowerment Institute, is considered a leading authority on behavior change and large-scale community and organizational transformation. Over the past two decades, he has developed a highly effective and robust transformational technology considered by many to be the state-of-the-art.<br>
<br>
He has applied this methodology to a number of initiatives. Included among these was a global transformative event created at the height of the cold war, the First Earth Run. In partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and ABC Television, he organized the historic passing of a torch of peace around the world. This simple and profound act of global unity offered at a moment of great fear engaged the participation of 25 million people in 62 countries, the world's political leadership and through the media an estimated 20 percent of the population on earth. It was an extraordinary confirmation of the efficacy of the empowerment tools.<br>
<br>
David applies his empowerment and large system transformation expertise to personal, community, organizational, and societal transformation issues. His clients include cities, countries, and large organizations wishing to create behavior change amongst their constituencies. The versatility of the empowerment tools enable them to address issues ranging from organizational culture change to low-income neighborhood revitalization; from environmental behavior change to emergency preparedness. Longitudinal research studies indicate the adopted behavior changes are sustained over time.<br>
<br>
His best-selling book, cowritten with Gail Straub, Empowerment: The Art of Creating Your Life As You Want It, has become a classic on the subject. Considered a master personal growth trainer and transformational architect, he coleads the Empowerment Institute Certification Program, a school for practitioners wishing to gain mastery in the empowerment transformational tools. He has served on committees appointed by the White House, the United Nations, and various international advisory committees addressing empowerment and large system transformation issues. His work has received considerable media attention and many honors.
