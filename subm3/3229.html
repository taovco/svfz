			<div class="content">For those who are new here, Heather O'Rourke was a child actress in the 70's and 80's who met a tragic end at the age of 12. In 2017, a post by enty on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead.<br>

<br>
Timeline: <br>
-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Tobe Hooper (dead), Michael Grais, Gary Sherman.<br>
Accomplices: Judy Wix<br>
<br>
-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).<br>
<br>
-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.<br>
<br>
Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. Heather’s family is threatened in 1989? The "skinning" was in 1991. Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. <br>
<br>
Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Bruce Kane (C), Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane, Lewis Arquette. (C) = confirmed.<br>
Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.<br>
<br>
-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result</div>
