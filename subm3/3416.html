<br>
"NEW ORLEANS — Two days after flames raged through a 154-year-old New Orleans mansion with strong ties to the Rex Organization, drone footage gave a peek behind the walls to show the extent of the damage.<br>
<br>
A 7-alarm fire tore through the home and raged for several hours before it became under control. <br>
<br>
According to the Preservation Resource Center - this home at 2525 St. Charles Avenue was built by famed architect Henry Howard for businessman Charles Miltenberger sometime prior to 1865."<br>

Here is text from CDAN posts, this first one isn't directly on topic but includes reference to the purpose of the Charles House: 'They always wanted leverage. That is their thing. That has always been their thing in New Orleans too.'  Also, consider the news regarding Pegasus spy software plus these first two blinds. I'm just wondering about it. Sorry if some dates are confusing, there are dates when first Blind was posted and then the date of the Reveal.. I may not have everything straight as sometimes I copied text from the former and then went back to find link to the Reveal as well.  I just put * next to original date of Blinds.<br>

Blind Items Revealed #43<br>
*April 8, 2021<br>
They are not allowed to say it. They are afraid to say it. They know they could end up dead if they say it. It is incredible to watch the linguistic gymnastic going on in a trial where a couple, but not all of the players know the real story but can't actually say anything. In the past, I have written and spoken about parts of this, but watching the trial play out is something else. You need to go back in time almost five years. There is a meeting between the ruler/killer and the now dead billionaire pedophile. Right after that meeting the ruler/killer had a meeting with the wealthy guy/book seller. The dead pedophile made much of his living off blackmail and extortion and doing dirty work for people and governments. He also did a ton of middleman stuff between countries and arms dealers. The ruler/killer was one of his biggest clients and someone you didn't cross. At some point after the ruler/killer met with the book seller, the pedophile was told to get dirt on him.&nbsp;<br>
The pedophile and the book seller didn't always cross paths but the pedophile knew enough people that did. Once every few months, the book seller's phone would be cloned. Not only did the pedophile know what was going on, but the ruler/killer did too. They always wanted leverage. That is their thing. That has always been their thing in New Orleans too. Anyway, after a few years of doing this, the pedophile hits pay dirt. Literal pay dirt. The ruler/killer is ecstatic. At some point, either the ruler/killer or the pedophile overplayed their hand. The pedophile met with the ruler/killer overseas and when he returned was arrested, jailed and killed. The ruler/killer was not about to speak, but the pedophile would have.&nbsp;<br>
Now, in the present day no one can decide who was the source of the information. At least two of the parties know, but they can't say anything. One of the parties has no idea and is flailing around trying to somehow walk away with money and probably wondering how all of this happened.&nbsp;<br>

There is a movie filming in New Orleans right now that no one will see. I mean, I am saying that because it looks like crap although it is about a permanent A list rock band. Anyway, one of the actresses in it that no one has heard of probably until this blind was in a show last year about porn no one watched. Well, except for one sheikh. He loved it. He saw her filming in town and had an intermediary offer her $50K for one night of sex. Now, that is more money than she has earned in the past several years combined from acting, so of course she was interested. She says she went by the house on St. Charles and then something scared her about the house and she walked away. She said it had an evil vibe. She went home and Googled the house and she found the blind about the house and this is where it gets freaky. About ten minutes after her Google search, someone from the sheikh called and said he didn't think green would be a good color for her to wear. That was the color she was wearing right then. She turned off the phone for two days and used a burner phone for filming. When she turned back on her phone, she expected to see a bunch of missed calls or texts. Nope. Her phone had been scrubbed of all conversations with the sheikh and his people. It was like it never existed. She thought she was losing her mind but remembered she sent a copy of the message containing the address she was sent to a friend. That friend still had that one message. For now.<br>
<br>
"The Dirt" - For now, the actress doesn't want her name posted because she is still very scared. <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/07/blind-items-revealed-4_15.html" class="postlink">www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/07/blin ... -4_15.html</a><br>

Blind Item #12<br>
It isn't like the people that run the House On St. Charles don't have a bunch of damaging information about this celebrity offspring. They have a ton. I previously wrote about how they used info about the sibling of the offspring. The issue they have is there is nothing really left to damage their reputation so there is no leverage. That is why that love interest was brought in. Pillow talk and secrets. Things they actually can use. <br>

A few years back, the CEO of a big star phenomenon was in New Orleans for a huge conference. Also there, headlining the event, was the person in charge of PC and mobile security for this massive software company. Both were also attendees at a party thrown at the house. Of course they both took the bait.<br>

Today's Blind Items - Got Him - A House On St. Charles Blind Item<br>
<br>
It is rare that when I reach out to the source for the St. Charles items that they actually reply. It is usually a one way street. I was reaching out to them to see if they knew anything about the mysterious death of an Ambassador in Israel. I was told they don't do anything in Israel, ever. That means they probably do. In their reply, they also shared something interesting which is that this A+ list movie director who is an Oscar winner/nominee and not named Spielberg had been under their thumb for decades. Apparently the director had a reputation, even decades ago for having sex with anyone he found interesting, whether they were old enough or not. It was so easy to catch him with someone underage and even after they confronted him and he started doing favors for them, he never stopped his behavior. It continues to this day. They really never used him for much other than some low level recruiting. They brought him up though because apparently he has been filming pre-made short films instructing people what to do in case of an electromagnetic pulse. They were not quite sure how he got roped into doing it but suspect the powers that be for the government also caught him doing what he shouldn't have been doing and forced him to make these films. They have been generating them like crazy. Is it preparation for what is happening on the sun right now or is it to use that as a cover for a man made generated one. The last one shut down the world for two days. Now, it would devastate it, especially if it happened now.<br>

"A couple of decades ago there was a power struggle at the top of this banking family. The one who emerged on top would run the empire. The problem for many was the person chosen. He wasn't playing the "game." He didn't care about running the banking world or grooming people to run countries and companies who were beholden to the family. He wasn't interested in keeping the secrets of the family within the family.<br>
<br>
There was no question that he could have easily been murdered by direction of the family member who wanted to be in charge. It would bring too many questions and if there was enough press attention, the company could have stayed in the cousin's possession for another decade or longer.<br>
<br>
It has to be a suicide. They just needed to get him to that point where he would commit suicide. He had always been unstable. They just wanted to push him over the edge. Would blackmail work? Maybe. The people who run the house are great at that, but this needed more.<br>
<br>
For help, they turned to a man who already was known in Paris for a collection of very young women/teens at his disposal. You know him as the billionaire pedophile. The only thing he appears to have done is provide the girl and he was chosen because of his connection to the family through a family member.<br>
<br>
The girl that was chosen was 10. She could easily pass for 16 or 17 with the right makeup. She was the perfect lure and continued to be a lure until the present day. The man they wanted dead had certain habits and he also had numerous affairs. They put the lure in a position where she would be seen by the target and knew he would interact with her. They knew his type. The family knew everything. With the help of the people who ran the house, the target had no chance. Things took their course and the target took the girl to his apartment in the city and had sex with her. Afterwards, with the makeup gone he finally got around to asking how old she was. When she replied 10, and that she really needed to get home to her parents or they would be worried, the expected reaction took place. Later that night, he hung himself."<br>

Today's Blind Items - Succubus - A House On St. Charles Blind<br>
<br>
<br>
It has been several years ago now when this A list mostly movie actress used to spend a great deal of her time in the city with the House On St. Charles. What is interesting though, is her history with the house goes back much further than that specific time period. In fact, when she was visiting so often with her significant other, she never visited the house. Her work had been completed long before that. A decade prior to her spending so much tie in the city, our actress was contacted by, at that point in time a high ranking member of the government who controlled the house. He later became its head of government. The two became very close and shared a bed on a number of occasions. He financed all her pet projects and put her in touch with people who could help her with her thirst projects. In the city, because of its location and geography are a number of consulates. The foreign consuls of the city often become Ambassadors for their specific countries. Over the course of a year, our actress entertained four such men and one woman at the House. All of the activities were recorded for posterity. Three of the five became Ambassadors for their respective countries, all of which are very large or influential and all feed secrets directly to the man who arranged the liaisons with the actress. The leader and the actress had a falling out but she stays quiet because of the things they did together other than her activities in the House. Those activities outside the House would bring down her career.&nbsp;<br>

It all makes sense if you think about it. What was the House On St. Charles known for? As I have recounted here several times, it was designed as the ultimate honey trap house of all time. Maybe Epstein and Maxwell would say otherwise, but St. Charles has always got the most return for its buck. If you will also recall, the owners of the house specifically targeted big name celebrities as part of their push. They wanted control over actors and producers and directors. Why though? They can pay of course and are worried about being caught as much as anyone else, but why them? Why the focus.<br>
<br>
Remember this is the city where the university covered up their experiments more so than anywhere else. They had the doctor everyone feared the most. They had the doctor who knew more about altering brains, than any other doctor in time. While his experiments and work is now being praised for bringing scientific breakthroughs in cures for certain diseases, one part of his research has not been discussed. It was his research, the hidden research that has caused the government to get into bed so deeply with Hollywood. It is not just about propaganda. It is what he hypothesized during his experiments. What would happen, if you didn't need the actual electrodes hooked to the brain. What if you could do it via some other method. What visual effect closest resembles/mimics what he was doing with electrodes. Was there something? Yes, there was. The thing of it is, everyone who submits to it, does so voluntarily.<br>
<br>
Back in the very early 80's when things were tough, they had to keep a low profile because of all the hearings and aftermath of the Congressional investigations. It was disguised as a grant paid to the university and it involved using 3-D in movies. This was crude. They were guessing and was not sure what was going to work. They needed a huge 3-D movie they knew would get tens of thousands of people into theatres to see what would work and what wouldn't. It also had to be a film that got people to react several different times during the movie and cause some stress. So many things to test. The government gave a whole bunch of money to get a movie made that really had no reason to be made and then, made it in 3-D. It was exactly what researchers needed, and they set up five theatres in different parts of the country with cameras and measuring devices to see the results of their tests.<br>
<br>
They also wanted to test it with a completely different kind of film. One which made zero sense to put in 3-D. It was ridiculous and also a really bad movie. To make things interesting, they picked a movie about spies and Russians. They wanted to test reactions in a completely different way.<br>
<br>
Those were the first two. Since then, they have refined and refined and found which actors work best delivering messages or lines. Funny thing how the actors that perform the best are the ones who were blackmailed. Two A+ list mostly movie actors are at the top of the list. Think the long long long awaited sequels in two separate franchises starring the same A+ list actor and in two very differing formats was a coincidence? It is the same type setup they used over three decades ago. Two total opposites.<br>

Today's Blind Items - An Exchange - House On St. Charles Blind Item - Part One <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2020/11/blind-items-revealed-1-anniversary-month.html" class="postlink">www.crazydaysandnights.net/2020/11/blin ... month.html</a><br>
<br>
It is not really discussed, but anyone can find out that this female offspring of a permanent A lister who would love to be a permanent A++ lister has a history of substance abuse problems. The thing is, she keeps her head down, so people don't really talk about. This is not something that was confined to youthful indiscretions, but it has not been a big deal. It was not even on my radar at all, or something I cared about until I was given a little heads up about some behind the scenes drama involving The House On St. Charles.<br>
<br>
What happened is not recent, but what did happen, and whether it will make it into the open is being hotly debated and involves multiple countries and heads of state and two very unlikely allies. The people running the House have a long history of putting people in compromising positions. They used the location of the house and what the city has to offer, to help make that happen. They were always looking for an angle. The angle didn't have to be right away. They were willing to wait things out until an opportune time.<br>
<br>
A couple of decades ago, the people running the House identified someone they wanted to have in their pocket. It is the female offspring mentioned in the first sentence. They knew she loved to party, and they knew she loved not only pot, but things much stronger. Our offspring had a bad experience early on in her drug purchasing life, and was grateful for these people who seemingly showed up at every party she attended and always had a ready supply of coke for her to enjoy and never asked for payment. Of course she didn't know she was being filmed. It was a lesson she would repeat in the future, but that is for another day.<br>
<br>
So, time goes by and one night, our offspring is at a party out of town, but her drug suppliers are right there waiting. Other people were waiting too. A bunch of undercover police types with wires in their ears. They weren't there for the drug suppliers, but were there for two other guests at the party. Much bigger fish in the party pond. Huge fish in the party pond and they liked to party. They also knew the offspring and knew how to ditch the people watching them. The next thing you know the suppliers are making all three of the party goers very happy and it is all being recorded. Every last bit.<br>
<br>
*December 5, 2019<br>
Part Two<br>
It wasn't long before all three of our party goers were wasted on coke and booze and, did I tell you they were all underage too? Yeah. The night ended and nothing was done by the people who controlled the House. Things just proceeded and they filed that little nugget away in case they needed it. Now, these obviously were not all the nuggets they had, but for the purposes of this blind, they are certainly the most interesting. It took a whole lot of nuggets to make the exchange happen. An exchange makes it seem like a prisoner exchange. It was not really that. Fast forward nine or ten months after the party night. Something horrific happened inside the country. Everyone knew who was responsible and almost immediately the richest of the rich from that country who were inside the US were put under protection so nothing would happen to them and then over the course of 48 hours managed to make use of their nuggets to ensure 140+ people could leave the country, and not only leave, but leave with the blessing of the only person in the country who could allow it to happen. A person who was confronted with some party nuggets. Someone on the opposite side was also confronted with a party nugget and more, but this is about the party nugget. There were so many pieces of information collected about so many people in power, that no one raised a fuss. No one questioned the decision. The thing is though, none of these nuggets are only used once. They are used as often as it takes to accomplish what is needed.<br>

Blind Item #8<br>
This former A list singer who makes movies now too in addition to the A+ list band duties is making a movie about the House On St. Charles. For now. He says he found listening devices in his house and there are people parked in front of his house 24/7. He is being followed and is pretty sure someone tried to run him over too.<br>

Four For Friday - A Favor Declined - House On St. Charles <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2019/07/blind-items-revealed-47.html" class="postlink">www.crazydaysandnights.net/2019/07/blin ... ed-47.html</a><br>
<br>
When you are dealing with Hollywood, it seems that many of the ideas they have for scripts are not very original. It is the same thing all of the time. This is not always the case and three decades ago a movie was made which showed the premise of how the government could use people who worked in the movies to make things look real when they weren't. The idea wasn't just a thought plucked out of the air, it was happening.&nbsp; It has been shown in the movies several times since, usually based on real life incidents. This is not about that though.<br>
<br>
The owners of the House On St. Charles saw a benefit to having someone who had experience in movies, and specifically in production design make things look real or to set things up in a way to make things seem like something they were not. So, with a ton of money in their pocket, they went out and found one of the very best that has been.<br>
<br>
An offer was made and from time to time this A list production designer would help out with projects. He knew what he was doing, but didn't know what was being done with what he was doing. That was his version anyway. Over the years, he managed to steer a lot of high profile celebrities to the people who owned the house. They, in turn made further introductions. It was a huge network and the owners always were looking for every advantage they could get.<br>
<br>
At some point, this A+ list mostly movie actor was introduced by our designer to someone involved with ownership. That apparently led to many adventures in the house and elsewhere where the A+ lister was filmed doing things which would cause great damage to his career. In fact, it was at this time that the A+ lister pulled back.<br>
<br>
The A+ lister discovered the recordings when he was asked for some special favors. Our actor completed those tasks but wanted out. He contacted the designer who had been the source of the introduction and asked for help. The designer agreed to help and had a meeting with some of the decision makers. He got angry and huffed and puffed and said he didn't sign up for the kind of thing that the actor had to do favor wise. Our designer threatened to go public. He was killed that same night.<br>

Blind Item #12<br>
<br>
I don't think it would shock any of you that southern politicians of both parties have visited the house on St. Charles. I don't think it would shock any of you that a certain southern Senator who is completely 180 of who he used to be less than a year ago has visited. The thing is, the people who would do the leveraging of him would want something completely different than how he is acting. It makes you think that perhaps the people in charge are willing to sell their product to the highest bidder.&nbsp;<br>

Blind Item #10<br>
I don't think it is any coincidence that this A- list dual threat actor has been seen coming and going from the house on St. Charles the past ten days and all of the problems plaguing his now former co-star this week. Also at the house in the past two weeks has been this foreign born B+ list dual threat actress who has recently been on a hit network show. She has been a long long time mistress of one of the owners of the house.<br>

Today's Blind Items - St. Charles House Of Horrors <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/todays-blind-items-st-charles-house-of.html" class="postlink">www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/toda ... se-of.html</a><br>
<br>
<br>
It is still there. It is still owned by the same people who have owned the house for hundreds of years. There is a sprawling house on St. Charles Street in New Orleans that has been used by politicians and celebrities as a secret pleasure den for almost 100 years.<br>
<br>
Over the years the owners have remodeled several times. The most recent of these remodels took place within the past decade. Unbeknownst to the various guests of the establishment, each room has been wired for video and sound.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One of the reasons this A+ list mostly movie actor has been drinking himself to death is the video he has seen of himself having sex with a 13 year old girl multiple times over a three week period.<br>
<br>
There was a political candidate who had all the backing and money in the world last year on the Republican side. He was then shown a video of himself with two college guys engaged in several hours of sex. After that, the candidate just kind of gave up. He went through the motions, but that was about it. He was given a consolation prize to make sure he is there if they need him.<br>
<br>
In the past week, all of this is threatening to come out of the shadows. Apparently one of the masterminds behind it, got into an argument with his father. The father, one of the wealthiest men in the world was killed this week in a freak accident. The thing is though, there was nothing accidental about it.<br>
<br>
You know who was a very frequent guest to the house on St. Charles? This disgraced A+ list movie producer. Do you know who helped set him up? This A+ list mostly movie actor who lives down there and heard two separate stories from two A list actress girlfriends who had both been raped by the producer.<br>
<br>
That producer led to buzz and more buzz and more noise. It also provided cover for people who were forced out. Want your wife to find out about the sex games you like playing with college girls? Then, now might be a good time to retire.<br>
<br>
The house on St. Charles is money central in the South. Super PAC's, movie financing. It is all entwined.<br>
<br>
$10M to one Super PAC came from two donations. A movie was filmed in New Orleans last year. Two of the actresses in the movie were, at separate times, provided some information about visits their respective A list husbands had made to the house. The next thing you know, two separate checks had been written. $3M from one A lister and $7M from an A+ lister. Oh, and that A+ lister? He had to couch up another $5M this year. Apparently he is OK with being caught with a guy even though he is in the closet. He does draw the line at him with tween boys though. His actress wife thought it was just guys he liked and not boys. Since she found that out last year, they have spent a total of about 10 days together.<br>
<br>
What is the purpose of all of this? I don't know. I do know though it is causing chaos. It will be interesting to see what kind of order comes out of this.<br>

			<div class="content">Anne Montgomery, New Orleans Carnival royalty and lifelong volunteer, dead at 93 <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/article_a1b888ca-5a7f-11ea-8f5b-6fef2316c45d.html" class="postlink">https://www.nola.com/news/article_a1b88 ... 6c45d.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2020:<br>
<br>
Anne Montgomery, a member of Carnival royalty and lifelong volunteer for groups dedicated to New Orleans’ youngest and oldest citizens, died Thursday at West Jefferson Medical Center. She was 93.<br>
<br>
Montgomery was a fixture in the upper realms of Carnival society for seven decades. In addition to attending balls every year, the 1947 queen of Comus and the 1970 queen of the Mystic Club welcomed Comus’ former queens into her home for two decades for an annual luncheon.<br>
<br>
..Carnival was a major part of her life. Montgomery and her husband, George Montgomery, welcomed hordes to their home at 2525 St. Charles Ave. for an open house every Fat Tuesday. But friends and family members said there was more to her than the pageantry and pomp of parades, balls and luncheons.<br>
<br>
She served as president of the Junior League of New Orleans and led the boards that ran the Institute of Mental Hygiene and Maison Hospitalière, a home for senior citizens that used to be in the French Quarter. Montgomery also was active in Catholic Charities, the United Way and the New Orleans Town Gardeners.<br>
<br>
For 44 years, she was a regular volunteer in Ochsner Medical Center’s neonatal intensive-care unit.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">She was also, briefly, a member of America’s clandestine services.<br>
</span><br>
<br>
Isidore Newman School and graduated from Rosemary Hall School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, and Barnard College in New York City.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">After graduating with a degree in history, she worked in Washington during World War II for the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency...<br>
</span><br>
<br>
Montgomery was leery of saying much about what she did there, according to her daughter Anne Montgomery Grace, but her children figured out that their mother organized and assembled reports from OSS overseas operations.<br>
<br>
“I felt she knew a whole lot more than she would say, but she was honor-bound not to tell us,” Grace said. Alston Montgomery Kerr, Grace’s sister, said their mother once opened up when they asked her when the OSS knew about the horrors of the Holocaust...<br>
<br>
Her answer: “About a year before we admitted it,” Grace said. “She would talk a little about what would come through, but it was so atrocious that nobody in Washington believed it.”<br>
<br>
After 2½ years in Washington, Anne Kock returned to New Orleans, where she made her debut, reigned as Comus’ queen and, in 1950, married George Montgomery...<br>
<br>
In 1976, the couple and their children moved into 2525 St. Charles, which had been in the family since Robert Downman bought it in 1906. When Downman reigned as Rex, king of Carnival, in 1907, he stopped at his home to toast guests, giving rise to a tradition that the Rex parade continued for more than a century....<br>

Rwanda, Morocco, India and Hungary denied having used Pegasus to hack the phones of the individuals named in the list. The governments of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, the UAE and Dubai did not respond to invitations to comment.</div></blockquote>

See where they are going with this?<br>
<br>
Just taking Azerbaijan for example.  I've written a number of posts about that country's connections in Dover Street, Mayfair London.. an area crawling with spooks.. if I can figure that out I'm sure that those 'investigative journalists' at the Guardian know which doors to knock on in London for answers to their questions.  But they won't mention MI5/MI6 involvement in any of this .. or even the fact that the Clintons courted Azerbaijan or that the Podesta Group represented them in DC...<br>
<br>
Nope, nothing to see here except wicked foreigners...</div>

A glimpse into the histories of NSO’s founders, employees and senior advisors reveals this tight-knit relationship between the Israeli hi-tech industry and the state military apparatus.

			<div class="content">I've been reading info regarding Jamal Khashoggi's death and events leading up to it, the odd timing of his personal romances. (I'm still working on a timeline)  Also other considerations... anyway I think something really stinks about the story and how it was reported.

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Interesting that you should mention the Pegasus spyware because I believe that we are about to see a distraction psyop conducted by the British and American intelligence services via media outlets like the Guardian newspaper.</div></blockquote>

FWIW - A big 921 event would stay true to some predictive programming I saw in an old TV series.  At any rate there is a certain trajectory from the latest media blitz driven from the Khashoggi NGO and his Turkish activist "Fiancee", the one he only met in May 2018 (the one who is always in the news even though it was Elatr that he DID marry June 2 2018.  I even read one account that never mentioned Elatr at all but referred to Hatice as his 'widow'.) All that media flurry must play some part in the narrative imho, if something happens.  Even having Hatice's lawsuit over the Khashoggi killing turn out front and center on the American media stage would be a great distraction device for whatever purposes 'The Powers That Be' might need.  There are many angles and players in the backstory but not ones likely to be pointed out to the public.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  There is one source (that I've seen anyway) which states that Hatice and Khashoggi married Sept 16, 2018, according to Islamic tradition with her family attending <a href="https://archive.is/KzmSl" class="postlink">https://archive.is/KzmSl</a><br>
<br>
Would that marriage be considered binding, since Khashoggi was already married 3 1/2 months earlier to Elatr (also according to Islamic tradition) ?  It would in Islamic tradition where you can have 4 wives apparently (unless Khashoggi had a few other brides stashed around the world /s)  <br>
<br>
6/29/21 Hanan Elatr, Egyptian woman who married Jamal Khashoggi, obtains signed Islamic marriage certificate <a href="http://archive.is/SpU9I" class="postlink">http://archive.is/SpU9I</a> (They married June 2, 2018)<br>
<br>
The Egyptian woman who married columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Virginia in 2018 has obtained an Islamic marriage certificate from the cleric who presided over the ceremony but had long refused to sign the document, according to the woman and her attorney.</div>
