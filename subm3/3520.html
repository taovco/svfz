Datacard to buy Dallas personal ID security firm <a href="https://www.startribune.com/datacard-to-buy-dallas-personal-id-security-firm/236270441/" class="postlink">https://www.startribune.com/datacard-to ... 236270441/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dec. 2013<br>
<br>
With Dallas-based Entrust, the new company will employ about 2,000 people. <br>
<br>
Credit and ID card maker Datacard Group of Minnetonka is buying personal identity security software firm Entrust for a reported $500 million.<br>
<br>
Datacard, owned by the Quandt family of Germany, did not disclose the terms of the transaction, but Bloomberg News reported that Datacard was paying $500 million in cash.<br>
<br>
Datacard, a formerly public company that was acquired by the Quandt family in 1987, sells machines that print credit, passport and driver’s license cards for banks and governments. Datacard has about $500 million in annual sales, Bloomberg reported.<br>
<br>
Entrust, a private company purchased from private equity firm Thoma Bravo, is based in Dallas and makes identity management and authentication software designed to thwart ID theft. Thoma Bravo acquired Entrust in 2009 for $124 million, Bloomberg reported.<br>
<br>
“Our business model has for decades been about enabling secure transactions, starting from the physical ID and moving to the digital ID,” Datacard CEO Todd Wilkinson told Bloomberg News. “Entrust comes at it from the other side. Together, we can cover a wider swath of the ecosystem.”

			<div class="content">Amazing Polly has done a few videos on Entrust, including:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Making Happy Slaves <a href="https://rumble.com/vkp7pj-making-happy-slaves.html" class="postlink">https://rumble.com/vkp7pj-making-happy-slaves.html</a><br>

In the latter video she talks about the encryption system Hillary Clinton used via ENTRUST:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://aim4truth.org/2018/09/17/hillary-clinton-controls-50000-fbi-encryption-keys-proves-muellers-witch-hunt-is-treasonous/" class="postlink">https://aim4truth.org/2018/09/17/hillar ... reasonous/</a> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hillary Clinton has all of our encryption keys, including the FBI’s. “Encryption keys” is a general reference to several encryption functions hijacked by Hillary and <span style="color:#FF0040">her surrogate ENTRUST</span>. They include hash functions (used to indicate whether the contents have been altered in transit), PKI public/private key infrastructure, SSL (secure socket layer), TLS (transport layer security), the Dual_EC_DRBG NSA algorithm and certificate authorities...<br>
<br>
The convoluted structure managed by the “Federal Common Policy” group has ceded to companies like <span style="color:#FF0040">ENTRUST INC</span> the ability to sublicense their authority to third parties who in turn manage entire other networks in a Gordian knot of relationships clearly designed to fool the public to hide their devilish criminality. All roads lead back to Hillary and the Rose Law Firm.<br>
<br>
Click here to read a list of just some of the “more than 2000 organizations in 60 different countries” that Hillary can control. Source: <span style="color:#FF0040">ENTRUST </span>10-K Annual Reports (1998-2009). SEC Edgar. Return in a few days for links to each of the ENTRUST annual reports from 1998 to 2009.<br>

<br>
Truth is, Hillary Clinton literally has access to every computer on the Internet through a company named ENTRUST. Her 19-year Rose Law Firm partner Jerry C. Jones directs the company (now ostensibly run by a Silicon Valley dude named Orlando Bravo and his private equity firm Thoma Bravo, LLC), and has done since Dec. 2003. Entrust issues the encryption keys for most major governments and companies in the world...<br>
<br>
..All you have to do is “borrow” the FBI key from Hillary or ENTRUST. Then you can connect to the target FBI computer using a bogus key created for you by ENTRUST, and voile! You then have two “trusted” keys so the FBI computers let you in. There are technical nuances to this description, but basically, you can do what you want with these keys. Don’t let trollers try to baffle you with techno-jargon to throw your dogs off the scent. Lucifer (literally, IBM Triple-DES) is in these encryption details...<br>
<br>
On Aug. 18, 1998, Entrust Technologies, Inc. went public after being started as a spin-off of Nortel Networks (Canada) to manage and distribute Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificate Authorities—the encryption keys for the Internet. Their customers include important military, banking, healthcare and government entities in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain and China.<br>
<br>
..On Oct. 14, 1998, SI International, LLC, later renamed <span style="color:#FF0040">SERCO SERVICES, Inc.</span>, was allowed to form with Lockheed Martin and Senior Executive Service (SES) executives associated with the treasonous <span style="color:#FF0040">Highlands Group</span> (Feb. 1995). Lockheed Martin runs the Queen’s “Golden Share” company British Nuclear Fuels Limited with SERCO...<br>
<br>
On Sep. 18, 2002, career IBMer Thomas E. Noonan (Internet Security Systems, Inc.) was appointed to the National Infrastructure Assurance Council (NIAC) by George W. Bush, surely recommended by James P. Chandler, and he remains a member of the Council to this day. In 2003, Noonan became a partner to ENTRUST INC. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) controlled by Hillary Clinton.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">On Oct. 29, 2003, ENTRUST INC was awarded the contract to supply all 50,000 encryption keys for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).<br>
</span><br>
<br>
ENTRUST INC, ENTU, Form 8-K. (Oct. 29, 2003). Entrust Announces Third Quarter-Financial Results and Targets Breakeven for Year-end 2003. Accessed Sep. 08, 2018. SEC Edgar. (Despite losses, highlights new contracts with Northrup Grumman, FBI, UK Customs &amp; Excise, Research in Motion Blackberry, Thomas Noonan, Acxiom Corp., California State Senate Counsel, KPMG).<br>
<br>
On Dec. 04, 2003, ENTRUST INC elected Jerry C. Jones as a “Class I” director to replace retiring Gen. Wesley K. Clark. Jones is a 19-year Hillary Clinton partner at the Rose Law Firm, Little Rock, Arkansas. With the appointment of Jones, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III had an ethical duty to disclose to the public that his approval of ENTRUST INC to manage 50,000 FBI encryption keys enabled his political mentor Hillary Clinton to have full access to the entire FBI operation.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSIONS:<br>
Conclusion #1: Robert S. Mueller, III had an affirmative duty to disclose his approval of the contract for ENTRUST to manage the FBI’s 50,000 encryption keys in late 2003. The FBI itself has been scandalously compromised to Hillary Clinton and the Rose Law Firm ever since.<br>
<br>
Conclusion #2: ENTRUST’s planetary control of the encryption keys for “over 2000 customers in 60 different countries” means that any matter handled by their customers at the FBI, Department of State, NSA, Treasury, etc. is the fruit of a poisonous tree—tainted by Clinton corruption.<br>
<br>
Conclusion #3: President Trump has enough evidence here to seize and prosecute the leaders of every government agency that has involved that agency, or induced other agencies to work with ENTRUST, without disclosing their total compromise to Hillary Clinton and her crime syndicate.<br>
<br>
Clearly, Hillary Clinton’s director surrogate at ENTRUST, INC., Jerry C. Jones (2003-2009), steered the development of the company’s control over encryption keys for the maximum benefit of his Clinton overlords.<br>
<br>
At a bare minimum, Mueller and the FBI leadership has had an ethical duty ever since Jerry C. Jones became an ENTRUST director to disclose his direct conflict of interest and compromise of FBI operations by Hillary Clinton, his mentor.

Obduction of a child after extensive experiments at the Charité</div></blockquote>

During the 1930's it had close ties to the Nazi Party. Numerous high ranking doctors participated in war crimes.[20][21] Most influential Nazis where working at the Charité. Max de Crinis, the head of the Charité department of psychiatry, was the leading figure of Action T4. Georg Bessau, head of the Charité department of pediatrics, tested vaccines on disabled people in 1942.[22] To cause gas gangrene, Karl Gebhardt had inmates carved deep wounds and contaminated them with bacteria, wood and splinters of glass. As an expert and military medical advisor, Sauerbruch advocated medical experiments in concentration camps.[22] At least 161 university physicians and roughly 30 research assistants were fired, and a number of undesired students were kicked out of the university clinic, so that the doctors could carry out their experiments as quietly as possible.[22] Forced sterilizations, the murders of the sick and human experiments – leading doctors turned their clinics into places of race and extermination medicine during the Nazi era. By 1945, the Charité systematically organized the murder of at least 300,000 handicapped children, institutional patients, sick people and Concentration Camp prisoners.[22]<br>
<br>
The university hospital states that till today it has just started to reveal details about its past.</div>

Your teen’s information is for sale.  Acxiom has records on just over 13,780,714 teenagers in the United States.  The average teen has been tracked by Acxiom for up to for five years<br>
<br>
Exact Data of Chicago sells anything about anyone including disclosing where your teen lives and the social networks they use. It gets its consumer information exclusively from Acxiom corporation.  If you don’t know who Acxiom is you should, it is the world’s largest data broker.<br>

[Charles D.] Ward founded Demographics Inc.

Pizza reference to data industry?<br>
<br>
While researching I came across this coincidental(?) pizza reference tied to human/company databases:<br>
<br>
In 2008 American Express Travel Services applied for a patent for a software program to prevent redundant mailings.  Companies' data would be matched through databases such as Donnelley, D&amp;B, or <span style="color:#FF0040">Acxiom</span>.  Example customers were all pizza companies:  Pizza Giant, Pizza Systems, Pizza Mansion, and Astro Pizza. <br>
<br>
Innocent joke by the software developers AmEx hired, or deeply sinister and tying "big data" somehow to Pizza-Pedogate?  I don't know...<br>
<br>
American Express is ruled by Warren Buffett of Omaha; he is their major shareholder.  John De Camp named Buffett in the Foreword of his book The Franklin Cover-up.  ..<br>
<br>
Also, I noticed Dun &amp; Bradstreet owned IMS Health, and Nielson which measures people's reactions to television programs.  It's enough to make you dizzy.  Has D&amp;B been CIA all along?  You decide.<br>
<br>
In 2007 infoUSA hired Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Jr., a Georgetown Law grad for $180,000/year as a VP although he did not report to work in Omaha. Instead, he had use of the planes! <br>

..Gupta is "a close ally of both Clintons,"[30] and a "major Democratic fundraiser"[43] and "rainmaker."[44] He "has a long history of giving and raising campaign money for the Clintons, and gave $1 million for the 2000 Millennium Celebration, a New Year's Party thrown by the Clintons."[45] Gupta later "hired Bill Clinton as a consultant . . <a href="https://archive.ph/bS1q8" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/bS1q8</a><br>

The other sponsor that has a logo on the 2012 Haiti survey is the "Interuniversity Institute for Research and Development" (INURED). What a weird acronym, isn't it?...<br>
<br>
If you search "INURED" on google images, it will bring a lot of really disturbing images of abuse and mutilations. How could this research institute possibly not realize that their acronym (which they use to refer to themselves on their website) is synonym with one of the core tenets of physical, mental and sexual abuse?<br>
<br>
.....And here is their logo: a sun containing a 8-pointed star hidden in the pattern of lines. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/650499087/INUREDLOGO_400x400.png" class="postlink">https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/65 ... 00x400.png</a><br>
<br>
The 8-pointed star is known in occultism as the Star of Ishtar, the babylonian goddess of love, beauty, sex, desire, fertility, war, combat, and political power. Ishtar is discussed on this sub in several posts. <a href="http://www.world-enlightenment.com/Circle-Symbols/image014.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.world-enlightenment.com/Circ ... age014.jpg</a><br>
<br>
Another high-profile and possibly equally salient use of a (fluffed out) 8-pointed star is the logo of the CIA <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Seal_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency.svg/480px-Seal_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency.svg.png" class="postlink">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ ... cy.svg.png</a><br>
<br>
Another interesting bit from the logo is the motto: "Konesan se Libete" which means "Knowledge is Freedom" in Haitian creole. Although this may sound like a healthy motto, I can't help noticing how this echoes strangely the latin aphorism "Scientia potentia est" or "Knowledge is Power", the motto of the surveillance arm of Darpa, the Information Awareness Office. Here is the logo of the DARPA IAO bearing the motto. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/IAO-logo.png" class="postlink">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ ... O-logo.png</a><br>
<br>
We need to monitor INURED too.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It owes its name to the fact that its original location was in Tavistock Square in central London. When it moved later to larger premises, it took its name with it. Although Hugh Crichton-Miller was a psychiatrist who developed psychological treatments for shell-shocked soldiers during and after the First World War, clinical services were always destined for both children and adults.[6][7] The clinic's first patient was a child...<br>
<br>
Following its foundation the Tavistock Clinic developed a focus on preventive psychiatry, expertise in group relations – including army officer selection – social psychiatry, and action research. There was an openness to different streams of research and thought as for instance the famous series of lectures given by the Swiss psychiatrist and one time collaborator of Sigmund Freud, Dr. Carl Jung, which were attended by doctors, churchmen and members of the public, including H. G. Wells and Samuel Beckett...<br>
<br>
After the Second World War, the Tavistock Clinic benefited from the Northfield Hospital experience and from the arrival of talented professionals from Europe, many fleeing Nazi persecution...

<span style="color:#00FF40">The many coincidences surrounding TAVISTOCK </span>by @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1709" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">kestrel9</a> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3191757" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3191757</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The late MP LEO ABSE has been investigated by police in connection with child sexual abuse allegations. His surviving niece, SUSANNA ABSE previously worked for the TAVISTOCK CLINIC as the CEO of Tavistock Relationships.<br>
The TAVISTOCK CLINIC was originally established in TAVISTOCK SQUARE, the location of the slaughter of 13 bus passengers on 7/7 2005. Margaret Hodge, at the heart of the Islington Child Abuse Scandal, has said that her SISTER was working in TAVISTOCK SQUARE at the time of the explosion.<br>
CLIFF RICHARD abused children at the Elm Guest House and elsewhere, it has been reported. Sir Cliff once owned a company called Blacknight Limited, an unusual moniker with distinctly occult connotations. Blacknight was registered to an address in TAVISTOCK SQUARE.<br>
In another extraordinary coincidence, CLIFF RICHARD's lawyer, Gideon Benaim, has his office in TAVISTOCK SQUARE. Benaim previously represented the notorious convicted paedophile, Roman Polanski.<br>
EXARO NEWS, the investigative news website that specialised in reporting on establishment paedophilia, was liquidated by the accountants Menzies LLP (insolvency practitioners Freddy Khalastchi and Jonathan David Bass). Menzies LLP is located in TAVISTOCK SQUARE.<br>
TAVISTOCK SQUARE was so-named because the estate on which it sits was owned by the Dukes of Bedford from TAVISTOCK, DEVON. In another coincidence, Exaro News' former owner, DR JEROME BOOTH, grew up in TAVISTOCK, DEVON.

			<div class="content">Stefan Quandt and Charite
<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/5m8v2o.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

<a href="https://www.stiftung-charite.de/" class="postlink">https://www.stiftung-charite.de/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Charité Foundation is an independent, non-profit foundation under civil law. It was founded in 2005 by the entrepreneur Johanna Quandt with the task of supporting the innovative strength and excellence of the traditional Berlin university medicine. The foundation is involved in two main areas: promoting the transfer of research between laboratory and clinic and improving the framework conditions for innovation and entrepreneurship in medicine. Since 2014, the Charité Foundation has also been promoting the life sciences in Berlin with its private excellence initiative Johanna Quandt .
</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://www.fr.de/wirtschaft/starke-witwe-11160460.html" class="postlink">https://www.fr.de/wirtschaft/starke-witwe-11160460.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Johanna Quandt's style of approaching things discreetly but firmly was also evident in other areas. In 1995 she set up a foundation named after her that aims to improve business journalism. Apparently personal experiences with the media play a role here. Her husband had a serious eye condition at an early age that eventually led to almost blindness. For many years she read to Herbert Quandt from the newspaper. This gave rise to the resolution to put the social role of companies and entrepreneurs in a better light in the media.<br>
<br>
To promote this, the Johanna Quandt Foundation awards grants to promising young journalists and awards the Herbert Quandt Media Prize, endowed with 50,000 euros, once a year. The award ceremonies were the few occasions on which Johanna Quandt generally spoke out critically on current business and political issues. The fact that she got involved in the health service without making a fuss about it also has a lot to do with her own experience. But in addition to helping children with cancer and promoting medical research, she was also interested in anchoring entrepreneurial thinking better in the health system.<br>
<br>
However, discretion and restraint can also turn into negative, can become concealment. A dark side of Johanna Quandt and her family becomes visible. For decades, not a word was lost about the role of many of the clan's companies during the Nazi era. Important armaments factories belonged to the company empire. The AFA company (later renamed Varta) manufactured all types of batteries for the Wehrmacht and Navy - including those with forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners. It was not until 2007 that the documentary “Das Schweigen der Quandts” brought the entanglements to light.<br>
<br>
There was never an official apology to the survivors. After all, Stefan Quandt admitted in an interview in 2011 that the unfortunate past is now "in reverse a point of identification": "Like our ancestors, we do not want to deal with our responsibility in the management and creation of a large fortune."

The prize is endowed with a total of 50,000 euros...<br>
<br>
The directors of the Johanna Quandt Foundation are Jörg Appelhans and Johannes Fritz. Johanna Quandt was a member of the Board of Trustees as chairwoman until her death .

Campus Virchow-Klinikum (CVK) <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf-Virchow-Krankenhaus" class="postlink">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf-Vi ... rankenhaus</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Rudolf Virchow Hospital in the Berlin district of Wedding was built from 1899–1906 as a municipal hospital based on a design by Ludwig Hoffmann in a pavilion construction...The clinic has been part of the Charité since April 1, 1995 and bears the official name <span style="color:#FF0040">Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum </span>.<br>
<br>
..From 1935 until the end of the Second World War , the Rudolf Virchow Hospital with the General Institute against Tumor Diseases was an institute for the treatment and research of cancer under the direction of the radiologist Heinrich Cramer, which was under the board of trustees of <span style="color:#FF0040">Ferdinand Sauerbruch </span>in 1933 –1934 was founded. The institute worked very closely with other clinics and combined surgical, radiation therapy and scientific-experimental aspects...
</div></blockquote>

How was it really at the Charité under National Socialism? <a href="https://www.welt.de/gesundheit/article189020075/Charite-in-der-ARD-War-Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-wirklich-ein-Held.html" class="postlink">https://www.welt.de/gesundheit/article1 ... -Held.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Ferdinand Sauerbruch, the head of surgery, played by Ulrich Noethen, leads these interventions. There he is, the hero. Jütte thinks this is the biggest problem of the new season and "almost a glorification"...<br>
<br>
In 1943, Sauerbruch was almost 70 years old and world famous. His medical merits are indeed huge, says Jütte. “His negative pressure chamber procedure has revolutionized surgery.” ..<br>
<br>
Jütte is disturbed by two episodes that, in his opinion, are not told correctly in the series. One is about the resistance fighter Hans von Dohnanyi, who is transferred from prison to Charité after suffering a stroke , where Sauerbruch tries to protect him from being attacked by the regime. But that did not succeed in the long run, von Dohnanyi was picked up and murdered in Sachsenhausen concentration camp shortly before the end of the war. In the series, Sauerbruch cannot prevent the collection because he is currently in Switzerland. Jütte says that is not true. “He was at the Charité when the resistance fighter was picked up. Witnesses testified that later. "..<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">He knew about Mengele's human experiments</strong><br>
<br>
The second episode, which Jütte considers “a blatant mistake”, is about the period after July 20, 1944. Sauerbruch's son was acquainted with Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, the conspirators had met in the villa of the Sauerbruch family, after the failed assassination attempt, Sauerbruch was targeted by the Gestapo. In the series, he can fend off the persecution because he signs a declaration, says Jütte. But it wasn't that easy. "Karl Gebhardt made sure that Sauerbruch was no longer prosecuted." Gebhardt, who was once Sauerbruch's assistant and meanwhile "chief clinician" of the SS and attending physician to Heinrich Himmler. The concentration camp prisoners tortured and killed during medical experiments and were sentenced to death after 1945.<br>
<br>
So a criminal, Sauerbruch knew about his crime, which could also be assumed. Because he wasn't just a jovial doctor, a surgeon who operated in piecework. But also general physician of the army, member of the Reich Research Council, supreme expert for all medical experiments under National Socialism. "He signed the application for the human experiments in Auschwitz concentration camp, which were carried out by Josef Mengele," says Jütte. He is responsible for these crimes, at least in a legal sense.<br>
<br>
Research reports in which Mengele is mentioned were also verifiably on Sauerbruch's desk, says Schnalke. It is known that Sauerbruch initially protested against the killing of people with disabilities, the so-called "Operation T4". But did he protest against the murderous experiments in concentration camps? Nothing is known about this. Research knew no bounds at Sauerbruch; in the end he allowed everything, says Schnalke. “He can't get out of the number. He knew about human experiments and he was silent. "<br>
<br>
One could have shown these attempts to make the horror understandable, says Jütte. Historical recordings are cut into the fictional images of the series episodes. Berlin in the 1940s, sunny street shots. Mostly harmless pictures. One could have shown photos from the Ravensbrück concentration camp, of the legs of the women who Gebhardt, Sauerbruch's old assistant, misused for his research. Gebhardt had deep wounds inflicted on the women and the wounds contaminated until they festered and sepsis set in, in order to test active substances from the group of sulfonamides. Many women died during the experiments.<br>
<br>
You can see in the series how doctors from the Charité, including the head of the children's clinic, Georg Bessau, a historical figure, test a vaccine on "Reichsausschusskinder" children. These children were so named because people on a committee decided that their lives should have no value. They were still useful as test material. This is not properly explained in the series. “The audience cannot understand how cruel and inhuman these attempts were,” says Jütte. The makers of the series would have "avoided what is actually terrible"....
