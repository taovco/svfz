			<div class="content">Over 8 years ago Getty Museum started to be center of conspiracy theory about alleged underground facility used by the elite even to sacrifice children in satanic rituals. That itself predates Pizzagate:<br>

And I've found that James Alefantis in fact visited Getty Museum and Getty Villa in December 2014 (timestamp on his posts says 96 weeks - before his profile was archived in Nov 2016) that is if we take for granted that he posted pictures just during or around time of visit.<br>

We know they together commented #killroom picture 8 weeks after theorized time of his visit at Getty Museum, she said to rinse something after he's done, and he commented it #murder. Very peculiar and suspicious considering other content he was connected with:<br>

Getty Museum is obviously on west coast, in California, Los Angeles:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2 German Connections in Epsteins Black Book, possibly leading to Getty Museum?<br>
<br>
I was looking for german connections to Pizzagate and went through <a href="http://documents.gawker.com/jeffrey-epstein-s-little-black-book-1681447470" class="postlink">Epsteins Black Book</a>. I looked at the phone numbers, +49 being the country code for Germany.<br>
<br>
The following 2 connections arose:<br>
<br>
-Heinrich and Milana Furstenberg (Full name "Von Fürstenberg", they are Dukes)<br>
<br>
-Astrid Kohl (apparently ex. german chancellor Helmut Kohl's niece)<br>
<br>
I started looking for Astrid Kohl but could only find a doctor. Since a phone number for Paris was listed I searched "Astrid Kohl Paris" and found that she is now <a href="http://queenmathilde.blogspot.com/2018/05/flashback-wedding-of-alexander-von.html" class="postlink">Princess Astrid of Liechtenstein</a> who has a home in <a href="http://www.luxarazzi.com/2017/12/at-home-with-princess-astrid-of.html" class="postlink">Paris</a>.<br>
<br>
The Fürstenbergs have a <a href="https://haus-fuerstenberg.com/family/?lang=en" class="postlink">website</a> with their family but not too much info.<br>
<br>
Looking for a connection I stumbled on a royal gossip forum: <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/celeb/millers/tatlers95.html" class="postlink">Getty, Astrid Kohl and Fürstenberg Connection</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Funny how good marriages can run in the family. Take Marie-Chantal's sisters: <strong class="text-strong">Pia Getty,28, who recently married Christopher, the son of Ronald Getty; and Alexandra,22, who has just announced her engagement to Prince Alexander von Furstenberg</strong>, the achingly handsome son of Diane and Prince Edward Egon von Furstenberg. 'They're not very interested in Americans,'a 'friend' was quoted as saying in American W, in whose pages the Miller sisters are a permanent fixture: 'No title, no accent, no play.'<br>
<br>
Friends include Prince Dmitri of Yugoslavia, Alex Nicolai, Anna-Louise Herrera (daughter of designer Caroline), Alessandro Corsini and his wife Michelle (nee Kwaitkowski) and <strong class="text-strong">Astrid Kohl</strong>, the niece of Helmut and the sort who, it was once commented, 'buys Renoirs when she is depressed.'</div></blockquote>

According to <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_von_F%C3%BCrstenberg" class="postlink">Wikipedia</a> Prince Alexander von Furstenberg is related to Heinrich Furstenberg. I just can't find the exact relation.<br>
<br>
So Astrid Kohl is/was friends with Marie Chantel Miller whose younger sister is married to a Furstenberg, and whose other sister is married to a Getty.<br>
<br>
Here is an older voat post about the getty museum in Los Angeles. [<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2925239" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2925239</a>]<br>
<br>
I know this is incomplete but I can't figure out any other connections right now. Might come back to it later or maybe someone has some info that fits in as to why they are listed in Epsteins Black Book.</div></blockquote>

Interestingly Furstenberg family is potentially linked to James Alefantis, Tony Podesta, Victoria Lynn Reis, Izette Maccoby Folger friend - Michael Louis Giacalone. Italian Michael Louis Giacalone has been allowed by Italian Princess Virginia Von Furstenberg from same family to follow her account on Instagram. Furstenberg house is also very much linked to Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and their friends:<br>

I have however no way to confirm this even to point of being reported by some newspaper, book, or other source. Maybe someone can help on this.<br>
<br>
So I wonder, is there really something about Getty Museum? We suspect that James Alefantis is hiding in plain sight - occult movies with weird references, weird pictures with strange activities under them, sinister art taste and suspicious connections. But was his visit at Getty another example of hiding in plain sight or was he just enjoying art. Hard to tell, but the topic is quite interesting.</div>

Blind Items Revealed #14<br>
January 3, 2018<br>
<br>
Slightly over three decades ago, there was a meeting on a yacht in the Med. A very important meeting. Things were dire and the whole escapade was crumbling and was going to leave some very important people with some very public egg on their face.<br>
<br>
Attending the meeting were several world leaders, two of the richest people in the world, and several others, all of whom who were being catered to by a group of teens from the country of  one of the world leaders.<br>
<br>
The focus of their discussion was half a world away. To see what they were discussing, we need to take a step back.<br>
<br>
In the late 1960's and early 1970's, G was one of the wealthiest men in the world. Although he could have any one in the world to have sex with, G enjoyed the company of young girls. Very very young girls. Under 10 was his preferred.<br>
<br>
He imported the girls from a foreign country and housed them in the annex of his home which he reached via an underground tunnel. The girls were supplied by a very close friend of his who we will call M. It turns out M also had a love of young girls and provided them to other people like G all over the world.<br>
<br>
In return, M was protected in power and also enriched himself personally from these men who gave him gifts of not only cash, but also paintings by the masters and so much more. They also arranged for other governments to prop his up in the face of rebellion.<br>
<br>
When G died, things started to go downhill. Although one of his children (J) also was a fan of the young girls and availed himself frequently, he also ended up taking things too far and some of the girls ended up dead. J also had some big drug issues and was not of the same caliber connection wise that G had been. J was also under a great deal of pressure from siblings and bankers to do something with the annex to the house. The same annex where the young girls were located.<br>
<br>
Fast forward a few years. The same men in power like G that had helped prop up M were all dying off. They were being replaced by other men who had their focus on other areas of the world. All too often they didn't care about young girls and had other vices that they could fulfill from other dictators. The problem was what to do about all the girls all over the world that were in place or dead? That was the purpose of the meeting on the yacht.<br>
<br>
What was decided was everyone who had a girl in their possession could keep them in place but could never let them go. If they wanted them killed, they could send them to J and he would make arrangements to kill them. In total, about 50 of these girls were killed. They were dumped beneath the foundation of an addition to the annex which was built several miles from the original annex.<br>
<br>
If you ever want to know why a hit was never put out on the spouse of M or any of his own kids it is because that meeting on the yacht was recorded both via audio and video and M made sure that everyone knows she has a copy of them. She also made it known that if she, or her kids were to die, that the recordings would be released. M's spouse is very old so people are worried that she has not made any plans to not release it when she dies. Apparently this recording discusses many world leaders and titans of industry who all had their own young boys or girls from this country they abused.<br>
<br>
Oh, and just so you know, this will be revealed. This is too important to not be revealed.<br>
<br>
G: J. Paul Getty<br>
M: Ferdinand Marcos (President of the Philippines) (art collection)<br>
Spouse: Imelda Marcos<br>
J: John Paul Getty Jr.<br>

			<div class="content">Great Post Heisenberg, so glad this forum still exists. I hope all the others come back as well, I just happened to stumble upon it again. Is there anything else I can look into? I know german well and could possibly find things you wouldn't find on english sites although Germany doesn't have nearly as much info on floating around freely as there is in the english speaking realm.</div>
