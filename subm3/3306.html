<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Founded by award-winning music artist, producer and Ocean Changemaker, Parvati, not-for-profit Parvati.org has a vision to slow down the melting Arctic ice...The plan is to create the world’s largest marine protected area in the Arctic, called the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary (MAPS). The hope is that this plan will stabilize the melting polar ice and compel a global shift to renewable energy. It seems like a tall order but the strategy is surprisingly simple. To create this marine protected area, Parvati.org is championing a unifying international agreement, administered by the United Nations, called the MAPS Treaty. This legal nation-binding document enters into force with the signatures of 99 nations...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Band Aid was a "supergroup" formed in response to the devastating Ethiopian famine of 1984. The band of about forty well known British and Irish pop music stars was organized by Bob Geldof, lead singer of the Irish band Boomtown Rats and Scottish rock musician Midge Ure to record the original single Do They Know It's Christmas?..<br>
<br>
Since this time, the Trust has also handled money raised through other charitable projects (e.g., Fashion Aid, Sport Aid, School Aid and Band Aid II) in continuing efforts to relieve hunger and poverty in Africa. To date, about half of the fund has been used to provide emergency relief, largely in Ethiopia and Sudan, where the threat of famine has continued to haunt millions each year. The other half has been supporting over 300 long term development and rehabilitation programs in Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, Chad, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and other countries seriously affected by the famine of the mid 1980s. Thus Band Aid has not only saved many African lives, but also transformed those involved and most importantly touched people all around the world...<br>
<br>
In March 2005, upon learning of the Band Aid Charitable Trust's work, Supreme Master Ching Hai contributed US$100,000 to support the fund in Her usual spontaneous fashion. Like many of Her other actions, this unpremeditated offering to those most inneed showed the unconditional and free nature of Master's Love; that is, how She always "gives without giving."

I'll get more into Watley in the comments below.  But I just want to get back to that favourite character of mine.. Ricky Dearman... that follower of the Supreme Master's cult... Here's Jean Paul Gaultier drooling over Ricky's abs in this MTV video clip from 1995

<br>
AN ANTI-CHILD-SEX campaigner accused an occult religious group of hosting parties at which naked children acted as waiters and at which members had sex with and murdered children, a tribunal was told yesterday.<br>
<br>
The obscure group Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) claims Dr Reina Michaelson and the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program described it in a website article as a satanic cult that sacrificed children and ate their organs and blood.<br>
<br>
It has complained under Victoria's religious hatred law that Dr Michaelson and her organisation vilified OTO members, causing revulsion, ridicule, hatred and contempt.<br>
<br>
According to OTO's statement of complaint, Dr Michaelson said it was not a religion but a child pornography and pedophile ring, that its members practised trauma-based mind control, sexual abuse and satanic rituals to discourage its victims from complaining to the authorities, and that it condoned kidnapping street children and babies and children from orphanages for sex and sacrifice in religious rituals.<br>
<br>
The case began at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal yesterday, but was adjourned to today to allow a last-ditch attempt to settle out of court.<br>
<br>
The article, still accessible on a website run from NSW, suggests senior politicians and television celebrities are part of a top-level pedophile ring and have been protected by some police. It says some members of the ring pretended to support Dr Michaelson's campaign and became board members of her group to subvert it from within.<br>
<br>
Adam Paszkowski, for Dr Michaelson, who was named Young Australian of the Year in 1997 for founding the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program, said the article was published on the website "without her knowledge or consent or authority".<br>
<br>
Dr Michaelson last year called for a royal commission to investigate her claims that Victoria Police did not properly investigate pedophile ring allegations.<br>
<br>
Earlier complaints led to a report by the police ombudsman in 2004 that was highly critical of two senior detectives.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>'Taylor had joined the Gnostic Catholic Church — part of a fraternal organization that preaches the Law of Thelema, a mystical and religious system that is unrelated to mainline Roman Catholic beliefs — and served as a facility manager for the church’s temple in Portland.<br>
<br>
(...)<br>
<br>
The parole board reviewed Lehman’s report along with letters from Taylor and four of his supporters, including his church’s bishop, Henry Hadeed.<br>
<br>
On Feb. 14, 2007, the board issued Taylor a parole discharge certificate, which read in part that Taylor’s “final release is not incompatible with the parolee’s welfare or that of society.”'<br>
<br>
- from <br>
<br>
Here is part of the letter Bishop Henry Hadeed wrote:<br>
<br>
"As an authorized Bishop of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica residing in Portland, OR, I have become well acquainted with David Taylor through his exemplary participation as a lay member of our congregation in a variety of settings and contexts (for example, in his frequent role as an assisting officer in the celebration of our principal liturgy). From my observations, based upon this experience, I have found that David consistently displays an outstanding degree of personal integrity, dedication, honesty, dependability, industriousness, intelligence, self control, and overall good will.<br>
<br>
"I strongly support his full release and discharge from parole, and gladly look forward to the further contributions he will undoubtedly make as a valued member of our Church."<br>
<br>
Read the two time killer and rapist's poetry here (it's on page 18):<br>
<br>
<br>
How the trial ended:<br>
<br>
<br>
A former body master informed me that in addition to his other roles, the now twice convicted killer was also both a Student and a Probationer in the Gunther A.'.A.'.<br>
<br>
A friend noted:<br>
<br>
"I'm still shaken by the unbridled praise Hank poured on Taylor in his letter to the parole board. I can't read it anymore without the echo of the trial coverage and DRJ's added details ringing in my ears. It's like a nightmare mashup.<br>
<br>
"As an authorized Bishop of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica residing in Portland, OR, I have become well acquainted with David Taylor through his exemplary participation as a lay member of our congregation in a variety of settings and contexts (for example, in his frequent role as an assisting officer in the celebration of our principal liturgy). From my observations, based upon this experience, I have found that David consistently displays an outstanding degree of...<br>
<br>
"...personal integrity,"<br>
<br>
"The jury further found Taylor guilty of kidnapping and robbing Gutierrez, and abusing Gutierrez’s corpse."<br>
<br>
"...dedication,"<br>
<br>
"As we learned in the past DRT wanted to feed the corpse to Wretha's dogs, Mercedes 'Sadie" Crabtree confirmed this detail but added that he had boiled some of the limbs and was considering eating them."<br>
<br>
"...honesty,"<br>
<br>
"David Ray Taylor shook his head vigorously and told the judge presiding over his murder trial that he had no desire to tell a jury his side of a story that prosecutors have characterized as a tale of horror."<br>
<br>
"...dependability,"<br>
<br>
"Taylor is in the rare position of facing a possible murder conviction after having previously been found guilty of murder. He served 27 years in prison for the shotgun slaying of a Eugene gas station attendant in 1977. The state parole board, on a 2-to-1 vote, granted Taylor’s release in 2004."<br>
<br>
"...industriousness,"<br>
<br>
"The jury also convicted Taylor on 22 felony robbery charges, in connection with two bank robberies committed in 2012."<br>
<br>
"...intelligence,"<br>
<br>
"Taylor, 58, allegedly had two younger accomplices stage a dispute outside a Eugene bar that worked to lure Gutierrez to Taylor’s home shortly before 1 a.m. on Aug. 3, 2012. Prosecutors say that after Gutierrez was killed at the house, Taylor and another suspect in the case dismembered his body."<br>
<br>
"...self control,"<br>
<br>
"Sadie also testified that DRT had an erection, visible through his pants, from the time AJ Nelson began wiring up poor Tino, all the way through the dismemberment."<br>
<br>
"...and overall good will."<br>
<br>
"A Lane County jury this afternoon found David Ray Taylor guilty of three counts of aggravated murder in the death of 22-year-old Eugene resident Celestino Gutierrez."<br>
<br>
.......<br>
<br>
Taylor was arrested for this murder on the heels of another OTO related murderer/prison ministry scandal in 2012 e.v.<br>
<br>
Read the Wikipedia entry on this child killer:<br>
<br>
<br>
Now read his obituary here.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's on page 11 of the pdf.<br>
<br>
At the time I wrote: <br>
"Is it just me or is this utterly appalling? The OTO tries to deny that the mass murderer Mathew Murray was a "member" of the Order because he was "only" a Minerval. They then proceed to count new Minervals as "new members" on annual reports. But this self-serving and transparently hypocritical stance cannot be taken here. Instead, they seem proud of the fact that the OTO had an "associate member" in prison who was there for killing four people - including two kids under the age of six! You will notice that the victims of Donald Ray Wallace aren't even mentioned in his glowing notice in Agape. How crazy is this?<br>
<br>
"I missed this the first time because I cannot bear to read Agape all that closely - it's too silly, stupid, and depressing. But I have a hard time understanding how Sabazius could approve of this kind of notice. Is our connection to this killer really something we want to advertise and be proud of? How does the fact that he memorized Liber Al while in prison make up for the fact that he murdered a four year old boy and a five year old girl - and two other people - in cold blood? If he had killed the children of one of the OTO's leaders would this thing have ever appeared in an official OTO newsletter? Please!..</div></blockquote>

GREGORY TILLETT WAS LEADBEATER'S MAIN BIOGRAPHER <a href="http://esoteric-guide.blogspot.com/2020/09/gregory-tillett.html?m=0" class="postlink">http://esoteric-guide.blogspot.com/2020 ... t.html?m=0</a> [archived: <a href="https://archive.md/O5nbC" class="postlink">https://archive.md/O5nbC</a>]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Gregory John Tillett is the researcher who has most investigated Charles Webster Leadbeater, his book "The Elder Brother" (1982) is the most important biography that has been written about this individual. And the most curious is that Gregory is not a theosophist, but an Australian priest.<br>
<br>
...And apart his book and his thesis, Gregory Tillett also published a blog where he added still more information: <a href="http://www.cwleadbeater.wordpress.com" class="postlink">www.cwleadbeater.wordpress.com</a><br>
<br>
How important were archives in your Leadbeater research?<br>
<br>
Particularly regarding Leadbeater’s early years, archives were essential resources since all the published material was simply factually inaccurate. Fortunately for the early years, the archival material was almost all outside Theosophical archives and therefore in the public domain.<br>
<br>
Is there significant Leadbeater material still withheld from scholars?<br>
<br>
The major sources of material still being withheld are those within the archives of the Esoteric Section (or School) of Theosophy, notably that held at Adyar, but there are also ES archives in the USA and at The Manor in Sydney, and, possibly, at Naarden (formerly Huizen).<br>
<br>
...... Unfortunately Gregory Tillett passed away on December 6, 2018, and below you can read two obituaries...<br>
<br>
..Greg was one of the early researchers in esoteric, pagan and occult spirituality in Australia, focusing particularly on the Theosophical Society. He earned his doctoral thesis with an expansion of his wonderful biography of C.W. Leadbeater and produced much ground-breaking research in this area.<br>
<br>
He was a legal advocate for members of the Gay and Lesbian community when homosexuality was still illegal in some states. He was particularly active and instrumental in this field during the awful AIDS panic of the 80s. Greg was also an expert in conflict management, teaching it at an academic level and co-writing one of the standard texts on the subject...<br>
<br>
In the early 90s Greg was active in the British Orthodox Church, becoming one of its leading priests, archivist and historian. Greg was one of the key people who helped bring the Church into the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate in 1994, where he was ordained. He became the first non-Copt to undergo the traditional Forty Days intensive training program following ordi- nation. As a Coptic priest Greg was an outspoken advocate for those excluded by Orthodoxy and Orthodox superstitions, particularly LGBTIQ people, women and non-Copts. He butted hard against the church hierarchy many times in his defence of the excluded.<br>
<br>
Upon retirement Greg broke new ground by transforming his home in suburban Sydney into a consecrated Coptic hermitage. There he lived simply but reaching out to help many people through advocacy, sharing of wisdom and the incredible blog, City Desert (link). I am blessed to count myself as one of those people....</div></blockquote>

The award ceremony was organized by the MDG Awards Committee in association with Humanitad. <a href="http://www.humanitad.org" class="postlink">www.humanitad.org</a><br>
<br>
Highlight of the Humanitad produced event was the presentation of a Lifetime of Humanitarian Achievement Award to <span style="color:#FF0040">Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu</span> who serenaded the audience with his rendition of ‘Sentimental Journey‘ after bitterly criticizing governments who spend billions on buying arms, when so many of their own people live in squalor. He also accused the world’s powers of misplaced priorities in the so-called war against terror, fighting the symptoms when the root causes should rather be addressed. “We will never win a war against terror as long as there are conditions in the world that make people desperate,” said Tutu. That desperation, in many cases, is what drives people to engage in violent conflicts, he added.<br>
