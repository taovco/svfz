<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For Dr. D’Agostino, there was no place like  home,  whether  in  his  native  Rhode  Island  or  his  adopted  homeland  of  Ken-ya. When he died of a cardiac arrest in a Nairobi hospital in 2006, he was 80 years young. His brother, Dr. Joseph D’Agostino of  Fairfax,  Va.,  later  shared  memories  of  their childhood to The Washington Post...<br>
<br>
Their  parents,  Luigi  and  Julia  D’Agos-tino,  were  Italian  immigrants.  Luigi  was  a  construction  worker  who  rebuilt  an  Atwell’s Avenue barn in the Mount Pleas-ant  section  of  Providence  into  a  cottage  for his six children. Angelo, who suffered from severe asthma, liked to build model airplanes and grow vegetables and flowers in the backyard..<br>
<br>
During the Korean conflict, Dr. D’Agostino  joined  the  Air  Force  and  served  as  chief  of  urology  at  Bolling  Air  Force  Base  in  Wash-ington, DC.  After completing his service in 1955, he attended a Je-suit retreat, and found his second calling.  He  joined  the  Society  of  Jesus and was ordained a priest 11 years later, in 1966..<br>
<br>
During  this  time,  he  switched  his  subspecialty,  and  studied  psychiatry. For several years, he taught psychiatry at the George Washing-ton University Hospital, and served as chief of its inpatient service.His  overseas  pastoral  work  be-gan in 1978, when the Jesuit order sent  him  to  Thailand  to  set  up  refugee  camps,  and  then  later  to  coordinate <span style="color:#FF0040">the Jesuit Refugee Service Center in Africa based in Nairobi</span> in 1981 for the thousands of refugees displaced from sub-Saharan Africa.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Society of Jesus also called the Jesuits function as Roman intelligence for the Italian Nobility. The Jesuits are a military order established under the Papal Bull called "Regimini Militantis Eclessiae" which means the Military Regiment of the Church. The head of the Jesuits is called the Superior General. The official definition of a Jesuit is one of intrigue or equivocation. Intrigue means trickery and equivocation means to lie. Jesuits are trained in deception and are entangled with everything in society. <span style="color:#FF0040">The Society of Jesus was involved with the genocide of Native Americans.</span> One example was the Jesuit priest Pierre-Jean De Smet who infiltrated the Iroquois. He requested "Black Robes" for the natives which were carrying diseases as a form of biological warfare. He provided intelligence on them which was used in massacres all while pretending to be their ally. The Jesuit photographer Francis Browne was on the Titanic and managed to get off before it sank. The Titanic was switched with its damaged twin sister ship the Olympic which was intentionally sunk as insurance fraud. The Jesuits who were previously banished from Japan were in Hiroshima when the "atomic bomb" was dropped. Pedro Arrupe along with seven other Jesuits were within miles of the nuclear blast zone in Hiroshima and all survived untouched. SJ Pedro Arrupe is in video testifying about Hiroshima before he was later made the Superior General the Jesuit Order. The Allies actually strategically firebombed Nagasaki and Hiroshima and claimed they were nuclear bombs as a form of intimidation.<br>
<br>
The Jesuits were involved with establishing Romanized communist settlements in South America known as the "Jesuit Reductions" which were funded by the monarchs of Spain and Portugal. The Jesuits were paying their dues back to the Italian Nobility which angered the kings of Spain and Portugal and lead to the Jesuits being banished from Europe. They were sent to Corsica and a few decades later Napoleon Bonaparte was born who then made war on all the European nations that banished the Jesuits. Immediately after the Napoleonic Wars ended the Jesuits were reestablished through the Congress of Vienna which was under covert control by the Habsburg and Thun and Hohenstein families who are Knights of Malta along with the Italian-Austrian nobility like the Pallavicini and Orsini-Rosenberg families. Napoleon Bonaparte wrote about how the Jesuits used him in his memoirs. Jesuits are deeply involved with science and astronomy. They run major telescopes and set the policies for NASA who reinterpret space which caused the flat earth deception and denial that space even exists deception. The Jesuits are dangerous liars and trained illusionists. The Jesuit priest<span style="color:#FF0040"> Pierre Teilhard de Chardin developed much of the modern New Age beliefs in his book The Phenomenon of Man</span>. The Society of Jesus are deeply involved with military, intelligence, politics, law, science, and religion. They are masters in deception and mind control and they seek to dominate over every aspect in society.<br>
<br>
Prince Julian de Medici of Ottajano is the head of the Cult of Hermes and the Rosicrucian-Freemasonic division called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Hermes is associated with trickery, thieves, sacrifice, sorcery, and initiation. There is a statue of Hermes at the Villa Medici on Pincian Hill in Rome. Hermes was later renamed Hermes Trismegistus and is the basis for Hermeticism which is a popular form of witchcraft and alchemy used by the occult. <span style="color:#FF0040">The name Medici means medical. The Greek word Pharmakeia means medicine, potions, witchcraft, or sorcery. </span>The winged Staff of Hermes of two serpents coiled around a staff is very similar to the Rod of Asclepius. The Rod of Asclepius is the most common symbol used in modern medicine. Serpents are venomous like their vaccines and pharmaceuticals. The Staff of Hermes is used for New Age initiations. Hermes was known as a trickster and a thief. Members of the Cult of Hermes are intellectual thieves that steal knowledge from others and then distort it as a form of false opposition through deceptive imitation. There are computer hackers involved with this cult and their leader is named Zachary James Carr and he is from Idaho.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Friends, supporters and representatives from beneficiary organisations gathered at <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">London’s Naval and Military Club</span></span> for Esharelife’s third Christmas Party this month – and raised thousands for <span style="color:#FF0040">Kenyan education</span> projects.<br>
<br>
The glittering event, hosted by sponsor Tratos’ CEO and charity founder Dr Maurizio Bragagni MBA, welcomed special guests from the worlds of politics, business and the arts and featured a highlight silent auction which saw works of art that were – for this year’s Christmas Party – generously sponsored by the artists, D. Mihov, Luca Brandi and Piero Mochi.<br>
<br>
Esharelife would like to extend its sincere gratitude and appreciation for the patronage of the Consulate General of Italy in London and the Consulate of San Marino, as well as for the outstandingly kind gesture of Michele Satta, who sponsored the wine for the evening. Likewise, an extensive Thank You to Sir Rocco Forte who also supported the festivities with a generous contribution.<br>
<br>
More than 100 invited guests joined the Christmas gathering to look back at the progress enabled by funds from the registered charity and hear about ambitions for 2020.<br>
<br>
Addresses were made by speakers including The Right Hon Jeremy Hunt MP; the charity’s Chair, Simon Blagden CBE; Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne; Lord Rami Ranger and Dr Selva Pankaj. Esharelife was overwhelmed by such great support.<br>
<br>
Special certificates of appreciation for outstanding donations and support were given to Mr Aris F. Mattheou, Executive Director – External Relations and Professor George Holmes DL, President &amp; Vice Chancellor both from the University of Bolton; Professor Paolo Volpin and Professor Paul Palmer, respectively Interim Dean and Director of The Centre for Charity Effectiveness at Cass Business School and Professor Phil Harris, Executive Director at the University of Chester.<br>
<br>
Esharelife showcased some of the opportunities and chances created through the provision of school places for children and vocational training for young adults thanks to the work of beneficiary organisations, including one of the charity’s founding project providers, international education aid organisation, AVSI.<br>
<br>
AVSI Kenya Project Manager Antonino Masuri gave an inspiring speech and a good understanding of the great work which he and his team are performing in Kenya. Esharelife is grateful to be able to support projects like the Distance Support Programme of Avsi Kenya, which beautifully demonstrates the impact our help has on the lives of less privileged people in our world.<br>
<br>
Dr Bragagni thanked friends of Esharelife for their continued support and especially valued the time invested by guests of the evening, naming it a special gift – and furthermore mentioned how everyone’s time would yield change for good for young lives, thanks to education...<br>

Wasn't Prince Philip the one who wants to come back as a virus? All these strange coincidences...<br>

Just a reminder, it was Ghislaine Maxwell who sat outside the<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> In-N-Out burger joint</span></span> in Los Angeles...I believe that she was actually referencing the Naval and Military Club..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Emma Harriet Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne (born 16 October 1941) is a British politician, who has been a life peer since 1997. She was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Torridge and West Devon in 1987, before switching to the Liberal Democrats in 1995...In 2017, Baroness Nicholson was appointed as Prime Minister's Trade Envoy for Kazakhstan.<br>
<br>
..Born in Oxford and a descendant of the family which founded London gin distillers J&amp;W Nicholson &amp; Co, Lady Nicholson is the third of four daughters of Sir Godfrey Nicholson, Bt and his wife, Lady Katharine (the fifth daughter of the 27th Earl of Crawford). Her uncle was Lord Chancellor in the 1960s,[4] and his daughter, <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">her cousin Eliza Manningham-Buller, became Director General of MI5.</span></span><br>
<br>
Prior to her political career, she was a computer programmer and systems analyst from 1962 to 1974, and <span style="color:#FF0040">a director of the Save the Children Foundation from 1974 to 1985.</span>...<br>
<br>
Nicholson fought for the release of Katiza Cebekhulu, the "missing witness" in the case of the death of Stompie Seipei. [9] The South African national had been part of the so-called Mandela United Football Club, the bodyguards of Winnie Mandela.[10] Cebekhulu later claimed that Nicholson had demanded £50,000 from him to obtain copyright over a book she had Fred Bridgland write about him; Nicholson denied this, saying her motives were "exclusively humanitarian and honourable"..<br>
<br>
..During the Iraq War, Nicholson gave evidence to the United Nations that she claimed showed Iraq had "hidden material used to make weapons of mass destruction".[16] She described the draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes as a "genocide"<br>
<br>
She has monitored elections in many countries. In 2006, Lady Nicholson was Chief Observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Yemen. She was a member of European Union Election Observation Missions to Palestine (2005), Azerbaijan (2005), Lebanon (2005), Afghanistan (2005), Armenia (2007) and Pakistan (2008). In January and December 2005 she was a member of the United Nations Election Observation Missions to Iraq.<br>
<br>
She also generated controversy through her strong opposition to international adoptions, which she believed had become a market and subject to corruption. While the EP's Special Rapporteur for Romania's EU accession she and some others in the international[18] community criticised international adoptions. Due partially to her pressure, the Romanian government in 2005 implemented legislation that de facto banned the practice, in line with practices in some of the EU member states. The measure generated controversy, mainly in the US, Israel, France, Spain and Italy, particularly from prospective parents. International and Romanian media also called attention to poor conditions in Romanian orphanages and hospitals where abandoned children remained for prolonged periods, while acknowledging some progress made in reforming child protection. In December 2005 and July 2006, the EP passed measures requesting Romania deal with outstanding pipeline cases, despite Romania having dismissed these formally through legislation after consultation with an Independent Panel of EU Experts on Family Law. Critics claimed that this panel was stacked with opponents of international adoptions. The U.S. Congress also passed repeated measures and held hearings opposing the ban...<br>
<br>
Lady Nicholson is the Executive Chairman of the AMAR Foundation,[26] which works to rebuild and improve the lives of disadvantaged communities in war-torn areas.<br>
<br>
She is Executive Chairman of the Iraq Britain Business Council[27] an organisation which facilitates business, trade investment, human resources, training and transfer of technology and know-how into the Republic of Iraq.<br>
<br>
Lady Nicholson is Executive Chairman of the Associatia Children's High Level Group. She co-founded its English counterpart, the <span style="color:#FF0040">Children's High Level Group (now the charity Lumos,</span> "working to end the harm of institutionalisation &amp; help children worldwide be reunited with family"[28]) with novelist and philanthropist J. K. Rowling.[29] Lady Nicholson is the co-chairman with the Prime Minister of Romania of the High Level Group for Romania's Children and the co-chairman with the Prime Minister of Moldova of the High Level Group for Moldovan Children...<br>
<br>
 She is <span style="color:#FF0040">Vice President of The Little Foundation</span>, and is Honorary Advisor to the Prime Minister and Government of Iraq on Public Health and related issues...
