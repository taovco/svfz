Forbes Energy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Energy" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Energy</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Forbes Energy LLC is an American company developing a new way of producing renewable, sustainable fuel and electrical energy. The Company is building a zero-environmental impact, global energy facility which uses ethanol derived from sugarcane. Forbes Energy was established in 2006 by entrepreneur Lucien Forbes. The concept was developed in 2003 when he visited a self-sufficient organic sugar production plant in Brazil. Forbes Energy is a Rhode Island Company...<br>
<br>
Forbes Energy’s goal is to deliver sugar-derived ethanol to the US market. Through Forbes’ location in the Dominican Republic and ability to operate within CAFTA-DR and CBI, the Company is positioned to produce ethanol for the US market at a competitive price... In the first phase of the project, Forbes Energy is developing a skid-mounted dehydration plant to be installed in the Dominican port of Manzanillo to refine Brazilian ethanol to import into the United States. The facility is capable of producing 10 million US gallons (38,000 m3) of fuel-grade ethanol per month. In the second phase, Forbes entered into a contract with Brazilian company Proeng to construct and supply refining facilities to convert Dominican sugar into ethanol. The plant will have an estimated capacity of 500 million US gallons (1,900,000 m3) of fuel-grade ethanol per year. The facility is designed to have a zero-environmental impact.<br>
<br>
Forbes Energy Dominicana will use agricultural lands under concession to grow sugarcane to supply the ethanol plant. Once construction of the facility is completed in 2008, Forbes Energy Dominicana will become a major fuel and electrical energy supplier to the Dominican Republic.. Forbes Energy is currently developing facilities in Manzanillo, in the province of Monte Cristi of the Dominican Republic. As production increases, the Company plans to expand into Haiti and other Caribbean nations.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>When in 1872 the Cuban Carlos F. Loynaz installed La Isabel, in San Marcos, Puerto Plata, it was recognized as the first steam-powered mill operating in the country. ..<br>
<br>
At the turn of the new twentieth century, official cadres reported other mills located in the vicinity of "the Bride of the Atlantic." The Cuba mill, owned by Brugal &amp; Co., appeared in the sugar production statistics for 1912, 1918-20 and 1925-28, as well as the Amistad mill, founded in Pérez at the end of the 19th century by the Bentz Brothers. who also promoted the Montellano ingenuity in 1918, for which they assumed important financing with the National City Bank and with local firms such as Nacif P. Haché &amp; Hermanos...<br>
<br>
Today Puerto Plata, with its soft hills dotted with palms and the trace of the sweet grass fading to make way for beach tourism, seems to be crying out - according to the press - for the reopening of Montellano, the last vestige of its sugar past, after the closing of Amistad.<br>

Puerto Plata, according to the 1879 Population Census, was a thriving multi-ethnic community. One of the most open - due to its status as the Cibao seaport par excellence - to commercial exchange and the reception of immigrants.</div></blockquote>

It is the country's third-busiest airport by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, after Punta Cana International Airport and Las Américas International Airport. Since its inauguration, Cibao International has been projected to become one of busiest airports in terms of passenger traffic in the country.[citation needed] Presently it has become the third-busiest airport in the Dominican Republic, only being surpassed by the airports of Punta Cana and Santo Domingo. ..<br>
<br>
The airport is located 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) southeast of Santiago City's center.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The air terminal mainly serves Dominicans residing in the United States, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Puerto Rico, as well as Haitians residing in the Cibao Region.</span> Recently many tourists and missionary workers are using Cibao Int'l as a gateway to the Dominican Republic.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">JetBlue is the primary international operator, with up to twenty daily flights to New York–JFK, Newark, and Boston</span>. The airline replaced flights from American Airlines, and some slots from other airlines flying to the United States of America.<br>
<br>
The construction of the airport began on February 15, 2000 and was finished in 2002. The airport was inaugurated on March 18, 2002 with two direct flights to San Juan operated by<span style="color:#FF0040"> American Eagle.<br>
<br>
In May 2002 Aeromar Líneas Aéreas Dominicanas made the first direct flight from Santiago to JFK Airport in New York. Later that month American Airlines and North American Airlines began direct flights to New York, Miami, and San Juan. A few months later Continental Airlines began direct flights from Newark. This was followed by direct service by JetBlue Airways and Delta Air Lines, both from New York.[1] Aeromar became Santiago as it secondary hub, after Las Américas International Airport...<br>
<br>
On January 9, 2009, <span style="color:#FF0040">Spirit Airlines</span> announced operations to Santiago from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, starting on June 21, 2009...</span><br>
