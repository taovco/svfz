Strike!<br>
<br>
Well our dumbass teachers are still on strike. I dunno why they feel the need to strike, they have JOBS wtf is their problem!?!?!?<br>
<br>
Typical liberal bullshit. All it is doing is disrupting OUR education! They should all be fired and then shot or put into work camps.<br>
<br>
<br>
The good thing about this is I get to spend ALL my time with Bekah. We have gone out to dinner, to the movies, and enjoyed our time together.<br>
<br>
So a few days ago she says this to me:<br>
<br>
"Hey Steff, lets go to a party. There will be music and dancing and stuff."<br>
<br>
"Oh? Whose party"?<br>
<br>
"A girls I know from (REDACTED) is having a house party and she invited me and whoever I want to bring"<br>
<br>
So I am curious so i say to her:<br>
"What sort of party is this?"<br>
<br>
And Bekah says "Its just a house party. Just people around our age hanging out, listening to music, dancing, they have a big backyard and will have lights set up and everything. You don't have to drink, and these people dont do drugs."<br>
<br>
So I say to her:<br>
"Ok well, what sort of people will be there?"<br>
<br>
And she gets quiet and says:<br>
"Well.....people like us."<br>
<br>
"You mean teenagers?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah but more than that. People who believe in the things we believe in."<br>
<br>
"You mean Orthodox Christianity and Nationalism?"<br>
<br>
"NO Steff. I mean people who.....people who feel like we do....about each other."<br>
<br>
So I say:<br>
"Bekah....is this a LESBIAN party?"<br>
<br>
And she looks at the ground and sort of shuffles her feet.<br>
<br>
"Well, They are MOSTLY lesbians but there are a few straight girls and bisexuals too"<br>
<br>
WHAM I clobbered Bekah with a clothesline. She dropped like a sack of rocks and hit the floor. I jumped on her back and slapped the camel clutch on her while she cried. I yelled:<br>
<br>
"I TOLD YOU WE ARE NOT LESBIANS AND I TOLD YOU WHAT I WOULD DO IF YOU EVER BROUGHT IT UP AGAIN!"<br>
<br>
she was crying her eyes out sobbing in pain and was all "AAARRGGHH you are breaking my back Im sorry I just thought it would be a nice night out PLEASE STOP YOU ARE BREAKING MY SPINE"<br>
<br>
I just pulled back on the camel clutch harder as she slapped her hands on the floor like she was tapping out. I yelled<br>
<br>
"I told you we are NOT lesbians!! WHY MUST YOU MAKE WHAT WE HAVE SINFUL!"<br>
<br>
I released the camel clutch and stood over her. I flipped her over on her stomach she she cried and spasmd on the floor. I got on top of my bed and dropped the elbow across her chest WHAM!!!!<br>
<br>
She started convulsing like she was being electrocuted. It was kinda funny to be honest.<br>
<br>
I got on top of her and grabbed her by the head and said "You will never ever ever see me again if you bring this lesbian shit up one more time. You got it?"<br>
<br>
and she was all crying her eyes out and she says "Im sorry im so sorry i wont i swear please dont leave me i love you"<br>
<br>
So I lay down next to her and held her tight as she cried in my arms for an hour. i stroked her hair and kissed her head and told her over and over again I loved her and I wont leave her as long as she behaves and stays away from sinful things like lesbians.<br>
<br>
<br>
she kept saying over and over "please dont leave me" and i told her i would not. I held her till she stopped crying and i kissed her and i said<br>
"Look Bekah, if you want to go to this party we can, but if ANYONE asks if I am a sinful lesbian I am going to say no. I get the feeling you want to go to this so I am willing ok?"<br>
<br>
So she smiles and nods her head and I kiss her and hold her tight.<br>
<br>
Well we went to this party and I have to admit it wasn't bad. They had awesome music, and a lot of non alcoholic stuff to drink....they did have alcohol but i didnt see anyone too drunk. i DID notice a lot of the lezbos were checking me out and I could tell Bekah was a combination of jealous and proud. I hung all over her all night to indicate she was MINE and she was hands off!<br>
<br>
we danced and we talked to a lot of people. I met some of her "friends". I kept asking her if she lezbo fucked any of them and she said no but she did make out with a few..GRRRRRRR!!!<br>
<br>
anyway we had a good time, and it made her happy. She just needs to understand what we have is NOT lesbiansism but rather, LOVE.<br>
<br>
<br>
thanks for reading!<br>
