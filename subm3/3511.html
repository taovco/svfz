<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Golden brains, golden lips, and golden balls were the three focal points of last night’s Scopus Award Gala at the Campus Biotech in Geneva. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem honored British architect Norman Foster with the award, which was designed and presented by Marina Abramović...<br>
<br>
Before any guests could activate their brain cells with 24 carats, however, Abramović had to get acquainted with Geneva’s scientific scene. The day before the gala, Kreëmart founder Raphael Castoriano drove Abramović to the Campus Biotech to scope out the event space. As he yelled out the window to a stranger about a parking spot, a scraggly-haired man pulled up on the right, offering a spot in the garage. It was Professor Idan Segev, head of the department of Neurobiology at the Hebrew University, and he recognized Abramović through the window...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ella Fontanals-Cisneros is a Cuban-born[1][2] philanthropist and art collector with an abiding passion, and discerning eye for contemporary art and design.  Born in Cuba and raised in Venezuela, her vision has made a significant impact on the Miami arts community and arts organizations around the globe. She is the founder and Honorary President of the Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation (CIFO).<br>
<br>
..Ella Fontanals-Cisneros is also known as entrepreneur and a pioneer in new technologies and other industries. She has served as a board member in both the corporate level and non-profit. She was the Chief Executive Officer of TGF Technologies, board member of Pepsi-Cola Venezuela, President of Su Red; a portal of the mobile operator Telcel; President of EFC Holdings, trustee at the Institute of International Education in New York and the United Artist in California.<br>
<br>
She is currently a board member the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Miami, the New Museum and El Museo del Barrio, both in New York...<br>
<br>
Since the 70s she has been involved with the arts; at a very young age she opened an art gallery named “San Sousi” in Caracas, Venezuela, encouraging her to follow her passion of collecting art. Latin American art was her first encounter with collecting, later developing her interest for international contemporary art.<br>
<br>
In 2002, she and her family founded The Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation (CIFO);[5] a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting contemporary Latin American artists. ..<br>
<br>
During the past five years, Ella Fontanals-Cisneros has been actively working and collaborating with art programs in Cuba with institutions such as the Museum of Fine Arts in Havana, the Lam Institute, and also the promotion of Cuban artists.<br>
<br>
Ella Fontanals-Cisneros has loaned selections from her substantial and eclectic collection of Latin American art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET), NY; The Whitney Museum of American Art, NY; The Museum of Fine Art of Houston (MFAH), Texas; The Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA), Long Beach, California; El Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (MNCARS), Madrid; Haus der Kunst, Munich, Germany; among others....<br>

<br>
In 1988, she co-founded the Antonio Cisneros Bermudez Foundation with her former husband <span style="color:#FF0040">Oswaldo Cisneros</span>. The mission of the foundation was to collaborate with public hospitals by providing them with training and know-how for the institution's personnel, helping them improve patient treatment before and after being admitted to the hospital. A couple of years later, she founded the Together Foundation in Venezuela with the mission of improving the lives of children by providing them with proper education, health and nutrition.<br>
<br>
She is also a humanitarian and environmentalist. As an early advocate for the use of information technologies, she founded the Together Foundation in the United States in 1989 with the objective of uniting the world around environmental problems.<br>
<br>
Working at the United Nations (U.N.), she organized the first information committee at the economic and social council, foreseeing that information and connectivity was key for the world to solve its problems. The Together Foundation worked in an important program organizing a database of best practices, in partnership with<span style="color:#FF0040"> “Habitat”</span>. This program has become useful for most of the U.N. departments and it remains a fundamental tool for the organization...<br>
<br>
In 1992, the Together Foundation designed a program with the environmental department of the University of Vermont, with the idea of developing the first electronic communications database for the environment. This system later produced a new venue of public access that connected people in the state of Vermont and beyond. The venue became a company called Together Networks, which at the time became the largest Internet Service Provider (ISP) in New England. In the year 1999, the company went public as One Main...<br>

Grupo Cisneros <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Cisneros" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Cisneros</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Grupo Cisneros is a privately held, family owned business headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, historically based in Venezuela, with a focus on Latin American and Spanish-speaking people worldwide. It is a conglomerate of media entertainment, digital media, property investment, tourism development and consumer product companies which reaches 550 million Spanish and Portuguese-speaking consumers in the Americas and Europe. It also provides media content to more than 100 countries. Its current CEO is Adriana Cisneros.<br>
<br>
Grupo Cisneros was founded in 1929 in Venezuela by Diego Cisneros and his elder brother Antonio José Cisneros as a small material transport business called D. Cisneros &amp; Cia..The brothers then obtained a license to operate a bus route and transformed the dump truck business into a bus business. In time, the Cisneros brothers created a bus line made up of 400 buses, which they sold in 1939...<br>
<br>
In 1939, D. Cisneros &amp; Cia. became an exclusive franchiser for Norge, Hamilton Watch Company, and REO Truck brands in Venezuela. In 1940, rapid growth led to the acquisition of the exclusive license manufacture and bottling concession of Pepsi-Cola products in Venezuela, which established the company's fortune. In 1944, the company founded Liquid Carbonic, which produced carbon dioxide as well as other beverage products...<br>

Nuestra Belleza Latina's Osmel Sousa has been in the middle of it all...He moved permanently to Miami after that and has kept quiet about the whole thing...<br>
<br>
His story of sequins and triumphs worked very well as long as the resources existed. But as of 2013, when Adriana Cisneros, daughter of Gustavo Cisneros, took over as CEO of the business group that owns the Miss Venezuela Organization (OMV), the beauty czar lost the monopoly he held. Since then, Sousa shares the jury's choice with the contest's parent company, Venevisión. Before it was a prerogative that corresponded exclusively to him...<br>
<br>
The Cisneros group is a business conglomerate that handles telecommunications, media, sports teams and real estate. According to the Forbes list, Gustavo Cisneros, who is at the helm, has a fortune valued at $ 1.38 billion. One of the sources explained that this decision is due to business interests, because since <span style="color:#FF0040">Jonathan Blum</span> is at the helm of Cisneros Media (2013), he has tried to include figures from the entertainment world who have contracts with Venevisión in the jury, as a way to promote the talent of the company...<br>
<br>
For more than a decade, Sousa has been exhibiting with people close to the government. In previous years, politics used to be excluded from the contest. At least from the doors to the outside. Now that has changed. The czar celebrated the triumph of US President Donald Trump: "he and his wife have always been very special to me," he commented when asked about this. ....<br>

			<div class="content">ooh, I just came across this old post by DonovanKeyhote  : <span style="color:#00FF40">Alefantis seeks fresh meat in Cuba</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2166431" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2166431</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Before his life became consumed by the madness of Pizzagate, restaurateur James Alefantis, the man behind Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing and Camping, took a trip to Cuba last year with the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art. He invited Nathan to join him, even though they would have different aims. Alefantis had art business to attend to. Nathan was there to visit “like all the Jews in Havana,” Alefantis jokes. “We met all these young Jewish Cubans.”<br>
<br>
But they also met <span style="color:#FF0040">Paolo Titolo, husband of Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban president Raúl Castro </span>and director of the country’s National Center for Sex Education. Titolo is an Italian photographer known for shooting members of Cuba’s transgender communities. Titolo took Nathan and Alefantis to a shantytown where they stopped at a shack with a corrugated metal roof, home to a local drag queen who makes dresses for young girls to wear to their quinceañera celebrations. Titolo told the Americans they would have to be discreet at the home.</div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Cuba Libre, Con Permiso</span> <a href="https://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/cuba-libre-con-permiso-art-artists-havana" class="postlink">https://www.studiointernational.com/ind ... sts-havana</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Artists are the plutocrats in Cuba and, with trade embargos with the US likely to be lifted soon, storied collectors and celebrities are already scouting around for their works...<br>
<br>
Like the peso – the one for locals worth 20 cents, the one for tourists five times that – everything in Cuba manifests a through-the-looking-glass ambivalence. At a polite distance from the local mercados that fly the bright but pitted colours of seasonal home-grown fruits and vegetables, high-end markets flash a year-round spread of frozen and wrapped goods, plentiful, pricey and shipped in from the world’s farther corners. The compliant are libre, while the dissenters, rendered as invisible as the nether-half of an iceberg, are in jail. Homosexuality, denied by law, is tolerated by custom, since Raúl <span style="color:#FF0040">Castro’s daughter identifies as lesbian and another high-ranking member of the island’s ruling family is loudly rumoured to be, covertly, gay.</span> The sea is an inviting tile-blue, but there is not a sailboat, fishing boat, or inflatable raft on the horizon. Cuba, in this context, is a prison.<br>
<br>
Privilege across the board seems linked to money, star-power, or connections that bring in the much needed tourist dollar. Swimming pools, for example, are illegal in Cuba, but I was told of at least five, all fronded from view. The only one acknowledged, at the <span style="color:#FF0040">villa-hugging embassy row in the suburb of Cubanacán, belongs to Cuban-born, Venezuela-raised, Ella Fontanals-Cisneros.</span> Relocated to Miami, she became a heroine of sorts after ploughing a large portion of an $80m divorce payoff from her billionaire husband Oswaldo Cisneros, not into the pet grooming / nails / flowers / entertaining / travel and house expenses he had thought it for, but into the Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation . Known as CIFO, this splendid free-to-the-public exhibition space, in a splendid warehouse conversion by local architect Rene Gonzalez, presents museum-worthy shows curated around her Latin-inflected, 2,650 piece art collection that have been focusing in - as with this year’s Gustavo Perez Monzon retrospective - on long-emerged Cuban artists...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Studzinski is heavily involved in hands-on philanthropy, patronage, and charity work. His numerous charitable activities revolve mainly around the arts, the homeless, and human rights. His own charity, the Genesis Foundation, supports and nurtures people in the creative fields in the early stages of their careers. He co-founded and chairs the Arise Foundation, which combats human trafficking and modern slavery worldwide.<br>
<br>
Also on the board of the Arise Foundation is Sr. Patricia Murray IBVM<br>
<br>
Among her many other responsibilities, she works with the international coordinator to oversee the development of Talitha Kum – the International Network of Consecrated Life Against Trafficking.<br>
<br>
In 2011 she was named as one of Inside the Vatican Magazine’s Top Ten People<br>
<br>
So, here you'll see many images of Studinski with Prince Charles and Prince Harry as he's also president of the American Friends of The Royal Foundation.<br>
<br>
The Royal Foundation has some interesting trustees. For example, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton : He's also a trustee at the Varkey Foundation<br>
<br>
Their Honorary Chairman is Bill Clinton <a href="https://www.varkeyfoundation.org/about" class="postlink">https://www.varkeyfoundation.org/about</a><br>

Sunny Varkey's organisation also runs something called Gems Education<br>

Gems Education also works closely with the ICMEC<br>

Ricky Dearman- father of the Hampstead children had an agent : Peter Ferris of FEA Management. Peter Ferris was nominated for a Global Teacher Award, a Varkey Foundation award.<br>

Brightline, the Miami-based train and real estate development company that wants to expand to Tampa, has a new partner: the Virgin Group, run by swashbuckling British tycoon Sir Richard Branson.<br>
<br>
Brightline announced the partnership Friday and said it would change its name to Virgin Trains USA this month. Virgin Group will make a minority investment in Brightline, which will be managed and operated by Brightline executives and affiliates of its parent company, Fortress Investment Group[1][2][3].<br>

<br>
A packed British Airways jumbo came within seconds of disaster yesterday when a mentally unstable passenger stormed the cockpit and attempted to seize the controls.<br>
<br>
The Nairobi-bound Boeing 747, with 379 passengers on board, plunged 10,000ft as the captain and one of his first officers wrestled with the intruder on the flight deck for two minutes.<br>
<br>
BA flight 2069 had left Gatwick six hours earlier and was cruising 35,000ft above Sudan when one of the struggling men accidentally disengaged the autopilot.<br>
<br>
Passengers screamed in terror and prayed for their lives as the plane dived steeply down then, witnesses said, banked left at a sharp angle heading for the ground...<br>
<br>
A flight attendant was thrown to the ground, breaking her ankle, as Captain William Hagan struggled with the intruder, poking his fingers into the man's eyes...<br>
<br>
In the scuffle the intruder bit one of the pilot's fingers and his ear but, aided by one of his first officers, Capt Hagan succeeded in dragging him out of the cockpit and into the club class cabin. There passengers rushed to help, including a 6ft 6in tall American who helped bundle the man to the ground.<br>
<br>
Phil Watson, 38, the co-pilot, who had been sitting at the controls throughout, pulled the plane out of its dive and ended the two-minute crisis, which took place just before 5am.<br>
<br>
Among those on board were <span style="color:#FF0040">Lady Annabel Goldsmith, widow of the businessman Sir James, her daughter Jemima Khan and her son Benjamin.</span><br>
<br>
Mrs Khan was travelling to Kenya with her children, Kasim, aged 18 months, and Sulaiman, four, for a two-week holiday.<br>
<br>
Also on board were the singer <span style="color:#FF0040">Bryan Ferry and his wife Lucy Helmore</span>, en route to Zanzibar for a family break. "I'm relieved to get here in one piece," he said on his eventual safe arrival in Nairobi.<br>
<br>
Capt Hagan, 53, whose wife and two children were on board, said: "It all happened very quickly. My first thought was for the safety of the aircraft and the passengers. We just did what we are trained to do.<br>
<br>
"In the struggle the intruder bit my ear but my first officer Richard Webb and I managed to get him out of the cockpit while my other first officer Phil Watson flew the aircraft. With the help of some passengers we managed to restrain the intruder...

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Captain Bill Hagan has now retired from commercial flying after 31 years. He is for the first time in his career free to tell the complete story of the attempted hijacking incident on board British Airways, London-Nairobi flight BA2069, which came within a whisker of becoming at the time the world's 3rd worst airline crash. <br>
<br>
Captain Bill Hagan was awarded a bravery medal at the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR) People of the Year awards.<br>
<br>
What makes this incident so interesting?<br>
<br>
✦The incident was the most extreme in UK commercial aviation history in terms of the extreme loss of control. <br>
<br>
✦It was one of the most significant in UK history in that it led directly to the locking of aircraft cockpit doors in UK Airlines in late 2001. <span style="color:#FF0040">Even if the awful events of September 11th had not occurred, UK Airlines would have a locked door policy, as a result of what happened on the BA2069 flight.</span><br>
<br>
✦It is perhaps the most intriguing incident because in spite of the above, there was no CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) enquiry- merely a review of the flight, commenced months after the event, and which was not made public. 
</div></blockquote>

<br>
Greetings from all of us – over 4000 children and 260 staff.<br>
<br>
I write at a time when all our children are facing end-of-year examinations, particularly crucial for end-of-primary and end-of-high school students whose future paths will be guided by their results. We have 154 candidates sitting their final Primary School examination, 8th – 10th November, while our 39 form four candidates are more than half-way through their final examinations. Please keep them in thought and prayer...<br>
<br>
I have just returned from my annual fundraising/PR trip in UK, Ireland and USA. I am always very happy for the opportunity this trip affords to meet with members of our International Boards in these countries. In Ireland I was delighted to be invited to speak in 5 schools from which groups of students come for educational and service experience in the Nyumbani programs. Currently we have been hosting 16 students and four staff from Loreto College, St. Stephen’s Green, my Alma Mater. The highlight in USA was the Annual Benefit on 30th September which reached record heights with an attendance of over 400 guests and a superb array of auction and sales items which attracted great funding. I was thrilled to be invited to speak and receive a collection in 3 Catholic parishes, while Receptions on Capitol Hill and in homes of Friends of Nyumbani, meeting with significant Nyumbani mission-related organizations, together with time with members of Fr. D’Agostino’s family, all contributed to what I believe has been my most fruitful USA trip.<br>
<br>
What has now become an annual event, a group of 10 Nyumbani Home children and 2 of our young adults accompanied by two staff had a three-week holiday in Ireland during the August school vacation. From visits to places of educational interest, like the Dail (Irish Government) and Trinity College, activities like kayaking and pottery-making to fun days climbing the Suarloaf Mountain and at Funtasia, their days were filled with excitement and enjoyment and they have returned with memories that will last a lifetime. Our gratitude to our Irish Board and their friends who gave of their time and resources to make this possible for our children.<br>
<br>
We are still in the aftermath glow of the Official Opening of the new laboratory facility and now look forward to extending our outreach and finally reaching 1S0 15189 accreditation. Recently Lea Toto featured in a publication of the Centre for Health Market Innovations(<a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org" class="postlink">http://healthmarketinnovations.org</a>) which identified two enhancing processes in the program: Diagnostic Laboratory Testing and Data Management. Another enhancing process which has developed recently in Lea Toto is a mentorship program which reaches out to our older adolescents to prepare them for the transition from pediatric care and treatment to adult centres through group seminars and a one-to-one accompaniment with an adult mentor who is living positively.<br>
<br>
I was sad to miss the visit to Nyumbani Home of Ms Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, Deputy SecretaryGeneral of the Council of Europe, on 25th September, 2011. To our delight, she took Nyumbani Home as a model when, some days later, she addressed the 9th Council of Europe Conference of Health Ministers in Lisbon. Other special visitors I missed were Bishop Ramirez of Las Cruces, New Mexico, who headed a delegation of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to Kenya, together with Ambassador Johnny Young (Ret.), now Executive Director of the USCCB. However, I am happy that I had earlier met Ambassador Young at the Benefit in Washington DC.<br>

<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Halloween brought our ever-loyal BA crew group to host a Fun Day for our Nyumbani Home children. This is a day the children look forward to with great excitement. </span></span>Dressed in Halloween outfits, playing games and partying, the children were able to spend several hours in the world of imagination, so important in childhood.  Another exciting day took place in Nyumbani Village when the Village youth challenged the Nyumbani Youth to a football tournament. Can you spot which team won?<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">We are still struggling to get birth certificates for our children, many with no known info re their parents.</span> Recently, Protus Lumiti participated in a radio show to draw attention to their plight. To be abandoned at birth or in the early years of life and then to experience that their right to an identity is problematic is surely one of the greatest injustices a child can experience. At this stage, they are unaware of this denial of their rights, but will learn about it later and have to cope with a second rejection. A follow-up of the radio show to bring this situation to wider audiences is now planned.<br>
<br>
Currently, an assessment of Nyumbani Village is in progress. Being a unique response to the orphan crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa, we are interested in having an objective evaluation of the model carried out with a view to replicating this pioneer approach in other parts of Kenya and Africa. Currently, we have 80 families in residence and hope to reach our target of 100 families during 2012. I have just commissioned the building of the last two clusters of family houses, Cluster 22 and 23, and, with the completion of staff housing for 24 persons due in the next few months, we will be able to evacuate Clusters 24, 25 and 26 presently occupied by staff.<br>
<br>
On 20th November, we will celebrate the 5th Anniversary of Fr. Angelo D’Agostino’s passing away. This year, with the anniversary falling on a Sunday, we will be able to mark this significant day with more time and space to celebrate what his vision back in 1991 has realized for thousands of children infected and affected by HIV over the years. When in the States, I was privileged to talk with key personnel from the National Institute of Health in Washington DC who opened up for me the world of young adults living with HIV as experienced in USA where there are many years of experience with this group. As our young adults leave us to re-integrate into the wider community, we hope and pray that we will be more and more enabled to prepare and accompany them during this important transition in their lives.<br>
<br>
May God bless you<br>

Also that article demonstrates that BA crew regularly visit that orphanage.  Not just the pedo pilot Simon Wood that was arrested... <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Endeavor is a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting high impact entrepreneurship. It currently supports 1000 entrepreneurs around the world. It began operations in September 2013 in Miami thanks to support from the Knight foundation where my daughter Adriana was invited to form part of the founding committee.<br>

Since her incursion into Cisneros, Adriana has infused a great entrepreneurial spirit both inside and outside the company...<br>

This is why in December last year, in my capacity as an Endeavor Mentor, I had the honor of participating as a judge for the ISP (International Selection Panel). Alongside my counterparts Jocelyn Cortes-Young, Daniel Heise and Lisa Raggiri, as well as Board Members Maurice Ferré, Sean Wolfington, Andrés Moreno and Ernest Bachrach, I was able to meet and interview people with entrepreneurial projects from 15 countries who are participating in the rigorous process of becoming part of this global network...<br>

A Spanish company that really caught my eye during one of the group of presentations where I was involved, was Shazura (previously known as Shot &amp; Shop). It is a software which plans to revolutionize the way we search for images on the internet. Its modern technology was developed by Sira Pérez de la Coba and transforms photos and videos into numbers. These numbers are then converted into data which means they are able to be compared with one another on the internet and facilitate searching...<br>
<br>
This is why I am pleased to share with you that alongside my daughter <span style="color:#FF0040">Adriana, Edgar Bronfman Jr. (Former Chairman and CEO of Warner Music Group) and Jordanian entrepreneur Walid Tahabsem</span>, we have decided to support Sira to take use of his platform to the next level. This will be done with financing of US$1 million and will mean the company will very soon be able to set up in Silicon Valley.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Activists condemned Gustavo Cisneros, husband to trustee Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, for his connections to mining in the Dominican Republic.<br>
<br>
“MoMA has the blood of Dominicans on their hands,” said Sandy Plácido, addressing a crowd of about 60 gathered across from the Museum of Modern Art on Friday, May 7 for the fifth week of “Strike MoMA” protests against toxic philanthropy at the museum.<br>
<br>
Critics of MoMA’s sources of funding often target board members Leon Black, questioned for his financial ties to Jeffrey Epstein; or Larry Fink, denounced as a private prison profiteer. But Plácido, a Dominican Studies scholar and professor of history at the City University of New York (CUNY), was there on Friday to shine a light on a rarely invoked name: Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, MoMA trustee and founder of its Cisneros Research Institute for the Study of Art from Latin America.<br>
<br>
Her husband, Gustavo Cisneros, sits on the international advisory of Barrick Gold Corporation, which has been accused of poisoning and displacing hundreds of people through its Pueblo Viejo gold mine outside the capital city of Santo Domingo.<br>
<br>
“The sinister logic of a husband who advises a global corporation creating havoc through its  mining initiatives all over the world, and specifically the Third World, and a wife who then turns around, collects abstract geometric art from Latin America, and sets up a foundation to ‘help people,’ is what brings us here today,” Plácido continued.<br>
<br>
“If you want to help, tell your husband to get Barrick out of the DR and from all communities that are suffering because of violent and environmentally dangerous mining processes,” she added.<br>
<br>
Earlier, activists passed out flyers and posters to all attendees, including a large-scale, richly-colored print designed by artist Kyle Goen featuring an upside-down MoMA overlaid with the diverse goals of the movement: Black liberation, Indigenous sovereignty, de-gentrification. The gesture of offering a free screenprinted art work to the public was partly to draw attention to the museum’s role in the art market and its hoarding of luxury and looted objects. Andrew Ross, a New York University professor, delivered a speech that touched on the power of these printed materials — freely distributed, yet high-quality — to complicate definitions of so-called “fine” art...<br>
<br>
The revelations around Cisneros come in the wake of leadership shifts at MoMA, which recently announced the election of Marie-Josée Kravis as Chair to replace the disgraced financier Leon Black. But members of the International Imagination of Anti-National Anti-Imperialist Feelings — the coalition of activists leading “Strike MoMA” — called Kravis’s appointment “a game of musical chairs,” pointing to her politically conservative ties.</div></blockquote>

Insiders have raised questions over whether HSBC appropriately informed US monitors about the ring, which was uncovered by the bank during an internal review. The independent monitoring team was specifically installed by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) as part of a deal not to prosecute HSBC in 2012, when the bank admitted allowing Latin American drug cartels to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through its accounts.<br>

			<div class="content">Looking at the Latin media scene in the US...<br>
<br>
&lt;...<span style="color:#FF0040">The companies belonging to Cisneros include</span>.. Miss Venezuela: The Miss Venezuela beauty pageant is now a multimedia event. During the Interactive Gala, the public can vote for their preferred candidate through social media networks. In 2013, the Miss Venezuela contest partnered with CIC Media and Sony Entertainment to create a reality show titled “Todo por la Corona” [All For the Crown] <span style="color:#FF0040">which was broadcast throughout Latin America by Univision. </span>Similarly, in 2013 it partnered with P&amp;G to create pan-regional product and works with 30 brands....&gt;<br>
<br>
Univision: TV Success Story That Will Last?  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jul-13-mn-55475-story.html" class="postlink">https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm ... story.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1999:<br>
<br>
In 1961, Mexican media mogul Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta saw a rich future in the steady stream of his viewers heading north and the vast population of Latinos who had already put down U.S. roots. So he made a move, buying KCOR-TV in San Antonio, the nation’s first Spanish-language TV station. He envisioned a vast Spanish-language TV network--christened Spanish International Network--that would bring programming, fed from his extensive library of shows, to Spanish-speakers across America.<br>
<br>
In a classic journey of immigrant assimilation, what started as one small Texas TV station has indeed blossomed into a nationwide broadcast network, now called Univision. The Los Angeles-based network today holds an astonishing 92% share of the prime-time audience that watches TV in Spanish--a universe that Nielsen Media Research estimates to be 8.3 million households and 28.3 million viewers age 2 and older.<br>
<br>
In Los Angeles, Miami and Houston, Univision-owned stations often draw more viewers than the major network-owned stations, and Univision is gaining share among key Latino 18-to-49-year-olds who watch television in prime time, whether in Spanish or English....<br>
<br>
..If Azcarraga had the vision, however, it fell to a Hollywood insider, A. Jerrold Perenchio, Univision’s 68-year-old chairman and chief executive, to realize his dream. As Univision attempts to straddle two Latino cultures, it is undergoing its own assimilation journey internally. Perenchio is an American who isn’t fluent in Spanish, and the company has hired so many non-Latinos in its sales and marketing staff that some dub it “McUnivision.”<br>
<br>
Yet its president and chief operating officer is an establishment Latino, <span style="color:#FF0040">Henry Cisneros, 51, a former Clinton cabinet member.</span> Programming is headed by an immigrant, and a few years ago, Univision decided not to allow a word of English in its regular programming or advertising (product titles and movie dialogue excepted). As Cisneros explains it, “We believe that we should defend the Spanish language like Tiffany defends its jewels.”..<br>
<br>
The Early Days of the Network<br>
<br>
After acquiring the San Antonio station and renaming it KWEX, Azcarraga quickly added stations in Los Angeles, New York, Miami and San Francisco. But instead of investing in original fare, he filled the air time with material from his Mexican Grupo Televisa, the world’s leading producer of Spanish-language broadcast programs..<br>
<br>
Azcarraga’s son Emilio inherited the business in 1972, but lost it, after a protracted legal battle, when the Federal Communications Commission found Spanish International Network in violation of rules prohibiting foreigners from controlling U.S. broadcast stations. In a two-year process starting in 1986, Televisa sold the network to <span style="color:#FF0040">Hallmark Cards Inc.</span> for $600 million.<br>
<br>
Hallmark, hoping to profit from the growing Latino community, changed the name to Univision and ramped up U.S. production. But Televisa took its popular Mexican telenovelas elsewhere, and replacement soaps from South America failed. Ad revenue never materialized. With a huge debt load to cover from the acquisition, bankruptcy loomed for Hallmark, as it did for rival<span style="color:#FF0040"> Telemundo</span>. In 1992, Hallmark bailed out, selling to Perenchio for about $550 million, the man it had outbid in 1986.<br>
<br>
Perenchio’s purchase went through, despite protests from American Latinos that his minority partners--Televisa, again, and <span style="color:#FF0040">Gustavo Cisneros (no relation to Henry Cisneros), owner of Venevision,</span> Venezuela’s leading television network--would mean a return to the days when programming was largely imported. “We were concerned that he wasn’t going to be committed to the [American] Hispanic community,” says Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos.<br>
<br>
New Ownership and a New Era<br>
<br>
Activists’ worst fears were realized as staff and programming budgets were slashed. Four senior executives defected to Telemundo. But Perenchio, a protege of legendary agent and studio chief Lew Wasserman and a former partner of Norman Lear, soon followed with a round of reinvestment. “Perenchio’s role was very significant,” says Jessica Reif Cohen, a Merrill Lynch securities analyst. “They took it step by step by step.”..<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Univision got a big boost this past season as Telemundo, under new owners Sony and Liberty Media, faltered in its own strategy to lure assimilated Latinos with high production values and mainstream stories. ..</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The national Republican Party is heaping criticism on Hillary Clinton for the family foundation's ties to foreign donors — even though some of those same donors have ties to former <span style="color:#FF0040">Gov. Jeb Bush and his family</span>.<br>
<br>
In its latest missive directed at Clinton, the Republican National committee complained about four specific donors to the Clinton Foundation during the time she was secretary of state.<br>
<br>
One of those donations highlighted Thursday by the Republican Party came from Gustavo Cisneros of Venezuela, who it listed as "tied to Nicholas Maduro."<br>
<br>
That's an attempt to link Clinton to President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, whose running of the country has been widely condemned because of his human rights violations and imprisonment of dissidents. Maduro is a highly controversial figure among Venezuelans and Cuban-Americans in South Florida.<br>
<br>
Although the Republicans complained that Cisneros donated to the Clinton Foundation, he's the same man who was reportedly among a group of wealthy investors Bush assembled to try to buy the Miami Marlins. In February 2015, the Miami Herald reported that Cisneros was part of a Bush-led "large offer" to buy the Marlins, an offer rejected by team owner Jeffrey Loria.<br>
<br>
And when Cisneros appeared at the Herald's Americas Conference at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables in 2007, he was effusive in his praise for the former governor and talked about what, almost a decade later, may actually happen. Speaking in Spanish about Bush, the Herald reported that Cisneros declared: "I want to see a third Bush friend in the White House." ...<br>
<br>
Cisneros was one of four specific donors the Republican statement cited. It's not clear how much any donor gave to the foundation or the total amount of foreign money, because the foundation website lists contributions in broad categories. Cisneros and his Venevisión TV network are listed on the website as contributing from $500,001 to $1 million.<br>
<br>
Another Clinton Foundation donor the Republicans complained about was Victor Pinchuk of Ukraine. He's been involved with the Bush family as well.</div></blockquote>
