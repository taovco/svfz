ABSTRACT<br>
Examples of the present disclosure describe systems and methods of creating a conversational chat bot of a specific person. In aspects, social data (e.g., images, voice data, social media posts, electronic messages, written letters, etc.) about the specific person may be accessed. The social data may be used to create or modify a special index in the theme of the specific person's personality. The special index may be used to train a chat bot to converse in the personality of the specific person. During such conversations, one or more conversational data stores and/or APIs may be used to reply to user dialogue and/or questions for which the social data does not provide data. In some aspects, a 2D or 3D model of a specific person may be generated using images, depth information, and/or video data associated with the SPECIFIC PERSON.<br>
Clip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
BACKGROUND <br>
A chat robot (chat bot) is a conversational computer program that simulates human conversation using textual and/or auditory input channels. Typically, chat bots are implemented in dialogue systems and natural language processing systems to perform various practical tasks (e.g., customer support, information acquisition, etc.). In such implementations, chat bots are trained using data conversational dialogue samples from various users and user sessions. As such, the chat bots in these implementations represent a generic, normalized version of the personalities and attributes of the entire sampled user base.<br>
It is with respect to these and other general considerations that the aspects disclosed herein have been made. Also, although relatively specific problems may be discussed, it should be understood that the examples should not be limited to solving the specific problems identified in the background or elsewhere in this disclosure.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Examples of the present disclosure describe systems and methods of creating a conversational chat bot of a specific person (or specific entity). In aspects, social data (e.g., images, voice data, social media posts, electronic messages, written letters, etc.) relating to the specific person may be accessed. The social data may be used to create or modify a special index in the theme of the specific person's personality. The special index may be used to train a chat bot to converse and interact in the personality of the specific person. During such conversations, one or more conversational data stores and/or APIs may be used to reply to user dialogue and/or questions for which the social data does not provide data. In some aspects, a voice font of the specific person may be generated using recordings and sound data related to the specific person. In some aspects, a 2D or 3D model of the specific person may be generated using images, depth information, and/or video data associated with the specific person.<br>
This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Additional aspects, features, and/or advantages of examples will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosure.<br>

<br>
...........................<br>
If you visit the website of the US patent &amp; trademark office, you’ll find patent number 10,853,717 B2, filed on December 1 2020 by "inventors" Dustin I Abramson and Joseph Johnson jnr, on behalf of Microsoft. Its 21 pages of dense text can be boiled down to this: Microsoft has been granted a patent on technology that allows the company to resurrect dead people by taking their online and other information, and using it to turn them into artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.<br>
<br>
The patent defines a chatbot, for those of us who haven’t had the lamentable misfortune of dealing with DStv’s one on WhatsApp, as follows: "A chat robot is a conversational computer program that simulates human conversation using textual and/or auditory input channels … Chatbots are trained using data conversational dialogue samples from various users and user sessions. As such, the chatbots in these implementations represent a generic, normalised version for the personalities and attributes for the entire sampled user base."<br>
<br>
It’s a scary thought. In the near future, you won’t have to let people die. Can’t bear the thought of living out your days without the company of your loved ones? Just turn them into simulacra.<br>
<br>
A worse way to put that is, in the near future, you won’t be allowed to die.<br>
<br>
Microsoft tells us that "living users could train a digital replacement in the event of their death".<br>
<br>
You might be familiar with the old saw that, in life, nothing is certain except for death and taxes. Well, that’s now going the way of other outdated idiomatic phrases such as "the cheque is in the mail", "tune in tomorrow" or "he hung up on me". Because if Microsoft and other big tech companies have their way — and they tend to — death won’t be certain any more.<br>
<br>
Hell, given that companies such as Amazon and Google don’t actually pay tax, it appears even that isn’t certain.<br>
<br>
To remind you of a few trenchant examples, Amazon paid $0 in federal taxes on posted income of more than $11bn in 2018.<br>
<br>
And CNBC reports that "Fair Tax Mark, a British organisation that certifies businesses for good tax conduct, assessed global tax payments from Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft between 2010 and 2019" and found that "the amount of tax being paid by these businesses is $100bn less than reported in their accounts".<br>
<br>
You won’t be surprised to learn that this affects developing nations too, and that, according to aid charity ActionAid, "Google, Facebook and Microsoft should be paying more corporation tax in developing nations".<br>
<br>
The organisation estimates that "poorer countries are missing out on up to $2.8bn in tax revenue".<br>
<br>
So, nothing is certain any more — except, perhaps, that Silicon Valley, or Seattle in the case of Microsoft, will come up with more and more ways to harvest profits from the data we’ve all irretrievably given to them.<br>
<br>
Patent 10,853,717 B2 outlines this for us: "Social data (eg images, voice data, social media posts, electronic messages, written letters, etc) relating to the specific person may be accessed [and] used to create … the specific person’s personality."<br>
<br>
I’ve come to terms with knowing that American platforms own all my digital data, but "written letters"? I guess, at this point, I should be grateful they still let me use my own name.<br>
<br>
The upshot, though, is that your digital footprint, as well as whatever real-life data Microsoft can harvest, can be used to turn you into an AI chatbot. You will live forever.<br>
<br>
It gets even more worrying. "A 2D or 3D model of the specific person may be generated using images, depth information and/or video data associated with the specific person."<br>
<br>
And you don’t just have to settle for resurrecting a loved one. "The specific person [represented in the bot] may correspond to a past or present entity (or a version thereof), such as a friend, a relative, an acquaintance, a celebrity, a fictional character, a historical figure, a random entity etc."<br>
<br>

..........................................<br>
Microsoft’s recent filing of a US patent for the creation of what it describes as a ‘conversational chatbot of a specific person’ has given rise to media speculation over how the boffins at Redmond will build on the blueprint.<br>
<br>
The patent (No. 10,853,717 B2, dated December 01 2020) conceptualizes technology that would access ‘social data’ about that specific person, such as images, voice data, social media posts, emails and other authored documentation, that would instil personality and inform conversations between the bot and a live human.<br>
<br>
‘In some aspects,’ the patent abstract continues, ‘a 2D or 3D model of a specific person may be generated using images, depth information, and/or video associated with the specific person’.<br>
<br>
How this could all come together is outlined at length in the remainder of the patent’s 21 pages. An AI component is not specified in detail, but it’s hard to imagine such a concept could function without some AI to breathe life into it, so to speak.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the patent and the possibilities its successful realization would deliver, have prompted some searching responses from online media commentators.<br>
<br>
Barry Collins at Forbes reckons Microsoft’s patent “raises the intriguing possibility of digitally reincarnating people as a chatbot”. It’s an idea that also “raises all manner of privacy implications that aren’t discussed in the patent,” Collins continued. “Will people be given the right to opt out of such a system, for example? Would the relatives of the dead be able to prevent others from turning their deceased loved ones into chatbots?”<br>
<br>
Collins added: “Such questions are, of course, moot until Microsoft – or someone else – delivers a working prototype. But it might not be the case for much longer that your personality dies with you.”<br>
<br>
Andrew Paul at Input reckons the patent’s scope “sounds like Microsoft hopes to better improve its customer service chatbots, as well as future AI assistance along the lines of Alexa, Siri or its own Cortana”. However, Paul found the implications for this kind of hyper-specific, digitalized personality mimicry as varied as they are unsettling: “Aside from the very obvious creepiness of a deceased loved one reading you Waze directions to the nearest Chipotle from beyond the grave, the idea of conversational AI based on an amalgamation of your tweets, Facebook posts, and text messages, coupled with voice mimicry, could usher in a whole new era of cyber-fraud and ‘identity’ theft.”<br>
<br>
Tyler Lee, writing at Ubergizmo, agrees: “By using AI and feeding it information, it could lead to next-generation levels of identity theft. We admit that it might be a bit nostalgic to be able to ‘talk’ to a dead loved one online where the chatbot can mimic that person realistically, but it still feels kind of weird – and a little bit wrong.”<br>
