BGI also works with Chinese communication technology companies such as Huawei to establish a biological/medical big-data center where the data is used to manufacture biochemical weapons and genetically enhance China’s military...<br>

A recent report (pdf) by the U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission (USCC) confirmed that since 2019, and on behalf of the CCP, BGI had infiltrated the United States to collect biological data from Americans.<br>

A portrait of David Pincus <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/living/20090726_Portrait_of_David_N__Pincus__a_global_benefactor.html" class="postlink">https://www.inquirer.com/philly/living/ ... actor.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>excerpts:<br>
<br>
Elie Wiesel has traveled all over the world with David N. Pincus, a retired Philadelphia clothing manufacturer. They've traveled to Auschwitz, to Moscow, to Kosovo, and to the White House...But a 1987 trip to Brazil stands out in the Nobel Peace Prize winner's memory. "We were going to meet the president of Brazil," said Wiesel, who was being presented with an award. "And David just disappeared."<br>
<br>
Pincus had discovered a colony of destitute children in São Paulo. Given the choice between attending a formal state banquet and a chance to spread joy among the poor, Pincus chose to visit the kids.<br>
<br>
Pincus is a largely unsung humanitarian, more comfortable working behind the scenes. He is well-known in Philadelphia art circles for his impressive modern collection and for donating his works to the region's biggest museums. But most of his charity has escaped notice because it was overseas, or anonymous...<br>
<br>
..I met Pincus 10 years ago when I was The Inquirer's Africa correspondent. He was a board member of the International Rescue Committee, one of America's oldest relief organizations...<br>
<br>
.Pincus set up a U.S. charity, Friends of Sparrows, to channel tax-deductible contributions to the hospice. It has sent about $250,000 to South Africa. The hospice has expanded into a village housing 330 clients, mostly children, with a budget of $1 million...<br>
<br>
..Pincus also introduced her to <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</span></span>, where he recently committed $1.3 million over five years to create a global health fellowship that will send two pediatricians overseas to assist AIDS programs. The gift will help the hospital take a lead in international health, said Rodney Finalle, the fellowship director.<br>
<br>
..In 1999, Pincus encouraged Nicholas to extend his outreach to the Dominican Republic. When Nicholas organized the International Family AIDS Program on the island, Pincus lined up support from Harold A. Honickman, the beverage mogul, and Sy Syms, the clothing retailer.<br>
<br>
..Pincus' father, Nathan, and uncles founded the clothing firm in 1911 after emigrating from what is now Belarus. The firm thrived. PBM became one of the largest manufacturers in an industry that employed 25,000 people in Philadelphia before the jobs went overseas.<br>
<br>
..Pincus' connections in the art world multiplied. He became involved in the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania when it opened in 1963. Through the ICA, he met Warhol and acquired a few of his works, some of them promised to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where Pincus headed the 20th Century Committee and was a trustee for more than 35 years.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Kathleen Foley is involved in the "palliative" medicine movement. She worked with George Soros, Purdue Pharma, and J&amp;J to manufacture the opiate crisis. Palliative Care trades the conventional concept of curative medicine with one that focuses on pain relief (opiates)<br>
<br>
She began working with George Soros in 1995 when he founded the "Project on Death in America" in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.<br>
<br>
This project began sponsoring doctors, nurses, teachers, universities, and textbooks to lower the threshold in which doctors would prescribe opiates. They created a "painscale" for patients and doctors, and integrated pain as a "vital sign". It started with terminal cancer patients and slowly opiates became the preferred first line strategy for all pain mgmt. They even funded propaganda stating opiates were "perfectly safe" and acetominophin and ibuprofen were dangerous due to liver damage<br>
<br>
The Sackler family got the raw material for their opiates from J&amp;J's farms. They too sponsored Kathleen Foley. Mortimer Sackler and George Soros were tennis buddies and neighbors in Gstaad.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mary Kerry Kennedy (born September 8, 1959) is an American lawyer, author and human rights activist. She is the seventh child and third daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel. During her 15-year marriage to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, from 1990 to 2005, she was known as Kerry Kennedy-Cuomo. She is the president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, a non-profit human rights advocacy organization..<br>
<br>
Kennedy is the chair of the Amnesty International Leadership Council, and her writing has been published in The Boston Globe, The Chicago Sun-Times, and The New York Times.[5] She also serves on the advisory board of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment at Columbia University...<br>
<br>
Kennedy is the author of Speak Truth to Power: Human Rights Defenders Who Are Changing Our World, which features interviews with human rights activists including <span style="color:#FF0040">Marian Wright Edelman, the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Elie Wiesel, and more. </span>..<br>
<br>
In July 2012, Kennedy allegedly sideswiped a tractor trailer on Interstate 684 in Westchester County. On the morning of July 13, 2012, Kennedy was found in her white Lexus. A police report said Kennedy had trouble speaking, was swaying and told an officer that she may have accidentally taken a sleeping pill earlier that day. In a court appearance on July 17, 2012, Kennedy said local hospital tests found no traces of drugs and that her doctor believed she had suffered a seizure. Kennedy pleaded not guilty to driving while impaired. Kennedy was charged by state police with leaving the scene of an accident. A toxicology report filed on July 25, 2012, said zolpidem was found in a sample of her blood taken when Kennedy was arrested,[41] at which point Kennedy released a statement saying in part, "The results we received today from the Westchester County lab showed trace amounts of a sleep aid in my system, so it now appears that my first instinct was correct. I am deeply sorry to all those I endangered that day, and am enormously grateful for the support I have received over the past two weeks." Kennedy said she did not remember anything after entering a highway to go to a gym and before she found herself at a traffic light with a police officer at her door.

Soon after the stoppage last year, an Inquirer analysis found that 24 percent of newborns, defined as babies younger than 31 days, had died after heart surgery at St. Christopher's from 2009 through 2014.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>An article written by Tenet Healthcare about our nurses...<br>
<br>
MetroWest Nurses Return to Boston Marathon Medical Tent<br>
<br>
On April 15, 2013, thousands of people crowded along the Boston Marathon route to cheer on friends, family members and strangers. The weather was perfect, offering ideal running conditions for those brave enough to endure the twenty-six mile trek.  The medical tent, which is equipped with everything that would be found in a hospital emergency room, was at half capacity. <span style="color:#FF0040">Several nurses from Tenet’s MetroWest Medical Center tended to patients suffering from hyperthermia, dehydration, sprains and chest pain. </span><br>
Volunteering at the marathon was an act of service that nurses from MetroWest had provided for twenty-four years. In fact, Dr. Marvin Adner, a physician at MetroWest, started the medical tent during his tenure as medical director for the marathon. <br>
In twenty-four years, the nurses had seen a wide range of injuries. And, this year seemed no different than any other.  <br>
Then, the first explosion went off. <br>
“Our volunteers ran out to the site of the bombing to rescue and save people, putting their own lives aside,” said Ruth Walton, chief nursing executive for the Northeast Region.<br>
The nurses started working to stabilize victims with serious injuries.  These efforts were critical to minimizing injuries as they worked to treat patients, sometimes just holding their hands and keeping them calm until the Boston EMS could transport them to the nearest hospital. <br>
“We saw people who were wide awake and coherent but missing legs, people with shrapnel wounds, and people who had lost their hearing and couldn’t answer our questions,” said Jeanette Corsini, a MetroWest nurse and head nurse of the marathon’s medical tent. “None of the patients were crying or screaming or saying anything. I think everyone was in shock. No one was prepared for a war zone, which is what it was.”   <br>
Because the nurses were so prepared and the tent was stocked with the needed supplies, the nurses were able to triage the patients and provide critical care to those awaiting EMS transport. <br>
Jeannette has volunteered at the medical tent for more than two decades. In her role as head nurse for the tent, she is responsible for assigning nurses to patients and working to solve issues that arise in the tent. <br>
“The tent is very organized. It’s always amazing how so many strangers can come together to make it work,” said Jeanette, who usually only knows a handful of the nurses working at the tent each year. The rest of the nurses come from all over the country – Texas, California, Maryland, Florida – as well as other Boston-area hospitals.<br>
Despite the chaos and trauma of last year’s marathon, all members of the hospital’s volunteer group returned to provide medical support for the runners on the one year anniversary of the attacks.  This year marked the 25th year of volunteering for MetroWest nurses. <br>
The day was sunny and warm and the medical tent was at full capacity, mostly with cases of hyperthermia and runners in need of fluids or ice baths. This year, like all of the other years, the nurses were proud to help. <br>
“This is their mission, they do it every year,” said Ruth. “Last year had to be traumatic for them. I’m proud of them for not letting fear get in the way.”

The BGICHOP partnership aims to discover the molecular basis of rare and common diseases affecting children.<br>
<br>
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and BGI formed a partnership to identify genes underpinning pediatric diseases. BGICHOP has been established to conduct large-scale human genome sequencing and analysis at the newly established Joint Genome Center at Children’s Hospital. The center became fully operational last month.<br>
<br>
The BGICHOP collaboration will combine BGI’s capabilities and expertise in whole-genome sequencing and analysis with Children’s Hospital’s extensive biobank and expertise in clinical phenotyping. “The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has built the largest pediatric biobank in the world, and because many of these samples have been linked to clinical data using an electronic medical record, we can now follow disease processes into adulthood,” points out <span style="color:#FF0040">Hakon Hakonarson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Applied Genomics at Children’s Hospital.</span><br>
<br>
BGICHOP will target both rare and common pediatric diseases. “The ultimate goal is to change the way we diagnose and treat diseases that affect children and families, and our work with BGI is an important first step toward that end,” says Philip Johnson, M.D., CSO at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

<span style="color:#00FF40">‘MY DATA, MYSELF’ CONFERENCE EXPLORES THE SCIENCE, LAW AND ETHICS OF GENETIC DATABASE RESEARCH </span><a href="https://drexel.edu/law/about/news/articles/overview/2020/May/my-data-myself-conference-genetic-databases/" class="postlink">https://drexel.edu/law/about/news/artic ... databases/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2020:<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">Leading off the conference was Hakon Hakonarson, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Applied Genomics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</span> Dr. Hakonsarson began his career in Iceland, where he helped to create one of the world’s first genetic databases based on samples from more than half the nation’s population. Iceland is the perfect place to compile a genetic database because the country’s small, homogenous population makes it easy for researchers to find connections between genes, mutations and diseases.<br>
<br>
Dr. Hakonarson and colleagues created a company to compile and store the data – deCODE Genetics, Inc. However, its efforts quickly bumped up against legal and ethical concerns. DeCODE had obtained samples from the medical records of Icelanders based on the notion of presumed consent – the assumption that data subjects have consented to inclusion of their information unless they affirmatively opt out.  That did not sit well with Iceland’s Supreme Court, which ruled that going forward, subjects must consent explicitly. As a result, deCODE was not able to include samples from Iceland’s entire population, but it still had enough to conduct a range of important studies.<br>
<br>
After leaving deCODE, Dr. Hakonarson founded CHOP’s Center for Applied Genomics, which created a biobank with genotypes of 100,000 children. A database of this size is tremendously valuable in finding biomarkers for genetic diseases to help develop treatments, and it is able to take advantage of novel gene editing technologies, such as crispr-cas9. Its work has helped to advance several new molecular diagnosis and treatment techniques; for example, it enables physicians to prescribe drugs more precisely using metabolic enzyme variants rather than height and weight to determine dosage. It also enables the use of more effective approaches to cancer treatment that are guided by a patient’s genome rather than simply by the organ system affected.  <br>
<br>
A decade ago, Dr. Hakonarson’s work might have seemed a science fiction fantasy, but today it is rapidly becoming common practice. A panel of experts in clinical genetics and research described a range of new genetic treatments and directions in research – and the ethical issues they raise. Michelle Holko, PhD, MS, Presidential Innovation Fellow with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) All of Us program, explained the program’s plans for compiling a unique genomic database for research.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040"><em class="text-italics">All of Us</em></span> is a historic effort to gather data over many years from one million or more people living in the United States. When completed, it will serve as an international resource for studying the ways individual differences in lifestyle, environment and biological makeup influence health and disease. So far, more than 271,000 participants have contributed biospecimens, answered surveys and agreed to share their electronic health records. About 80 percent of them are from populations traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. Such a large database that broadly represents the population holds tremendous promise for advancing the field of precision medicine, which targets treatments to each patient’s genetic makeup.<br>
<br>
Reed Pyeritz, MD, PhD, William Smilow Professor at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, described the problem of “variants of uncertain significance,” genetic findings that are difficult to interpret. There had been an assumption that as genetic sequencing and analysis techniques evolved, uncertainties in interpreting the results would diminish. However, the availability of more data at more refined levels has actually increased uncertainties, which has created ethical conundrums for physicians and patients.<br>
<br>
Dr. Pyeritz also described a related problem of whether and when to recontact patients as new discoveries affecting the interpretation of their genetic profiles are made. Communication guidelines are lacking, in particular guidelines for obtaining consent from patients for receiving updates. “Recontact is not a simple issue,” said Dr. Pyeritz. In addition to ethical concerns, there are practical constraints. For example, how do you contact patients who change their physical and digital addresses?<br>
<br>
Another concern is the appropriate response of clinicians when genetic testing indicates susceptibility to a disease for which the patient was not tested. Is there an ethical duty to communicate these incidental findings? What kind of consent should patients provide before they can be informed of them?...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Sierra Luther, associate counsel at <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">23andMe</span></span>, noted that while current privacy law offers piecemeal guidance for permissible data use, consumers can choose a genetic testing company that “does the correct job, aligns with the practice that you believe, [and] then you will maintain meaningful control over your data.” She described her company’s efforts to lead in that regard by clearly and publicly disclosing its data privacy practices and company-wide security measures, allowing customers to opt-in to the use of their data in research, and subjecting research to review by an internal institutional review board.<br>
<br>
...Holly Fernandez Lynch, JD, MBe, John Russell Dickson, MD Presidential Assistant Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, elaborated on the role of IRBs in protecting privacy in human subjects research and the shortcomings of their oversight. They do not review non-research uses of data, secondary research with deidentified data, research considered to pose limited risk, and activities exempted by local policy. Some of these gaps are addressed by other federal laws, but some are not. She also discussed the role of data access committees, which review requests for access to research databases. But, again, their effectiveness is uneven.<br>
<br>
Bringing these themes together was Mark A. Rothstein, Herbert F. Boehl Chair of Law and Medicine at the University of Louisville School of Medicine and Brandeis School of Law. He emphasized the limitations of current laws in the realm of health information privacy.<br>
<br>
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is the primary legal protection for patient medical health information, was actually enacted for a different purpose. It was intended to address the problem of job lock, which had kept many employees from changing jobs because a subsequent employer’s health coverage would exclude them based on a <span style="color:#FF0040">preexisting condition</span>.  Protection of patient privacy was added as an afterthought. The law directed the Department of Health and Human Services to enact regulations to that end, which became known as the HIPAA Privacy Rule. However, the Rule is limited in scope, applying only to records kept by health care providers, health plans, health clearing houses, and their business associates. It does not apply to employers, life insurance companies, and other entities not in the payment chain. The Rule also includes 12 broadly worded “public purpose” exceptions that allow providers to disclose, without a patient’s knowledge or consent, health information in individually identifiable form.<br>
<br>
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was enacted to allay fears regarding discrimination based specifically on genetic information. However, that law is also limited in scope, applying only to discrimination in health insurance and employment. Professor Rothstein remarked that the statute’s definitions of discrimination are “locked in time” because they only apply to “human DNA” and therefore do not cover information generated by such new technologies as epigenetics and microbiomics. Moreover, the law does not apply to life, disability or long-term care insurance, or to genetic discrimination in education, housing and other important areas, and it does not apply once a genetic condition has become manifest.<br>
<br>
Professor Rothstein concluded, “We have no privacy. We may think we do, but there is no privacy of health information.” Creating sufficient protections will be difficult, but “not having privacy, I think, would be worse. We’d lose dignity, humanity.”  <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The conference took place just before the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread across the United States and social distancing measures were put in place in all states. </span>The topic of genetic database privacy has taken on increasing urgency, as genetic research is called on to help understand the virus’s spread. ..</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Although dripping in fin-de-siècle charm, the Cedar Park firehouse was the result of a no-bid, lifetime city contract that remained inviolate for 30 years and netted architect <span style="color:#FF0040">Philip H. Johnson</span> a small fortune.  Johnson owed his good luck thanks to a familial connection to one of Philadelphia’s most powerful political bosses. In 1903, when journalist Lincoln Steffens described Philadelphia as “corrupt and contented” (and the same year Johnson’s drafted the firehouse plans), the city’s 7th Ward was under the iron-fisted rule of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Republican boss Israel M. Durham</span>. A longtime party operative who had served in the Pennsylvania State Senate and as State Insurance Commissioner, he lavished generous salaries on himself and his loyal associates.  He also traveled widely to Europe and the American West, all while receiving a handsome $20,000 a year salary as State Insurance Commissioner. During his final years, he became majority owner and president of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team.  Although poor health prevented Durham from watching from the stands, he kept a telephone by his hospital bed so he could manage the team and follow the games in real time.<br>
<br>
One of Durham’s most controversial acts was the awarding of a lifetime contract to his brother-in-law Philip Johnson for City Health Department projects. No relation to the famed modernist architect of the same name, Johnson was a competent (if not particularly imaginative) architect who had previously worked at the City’s Bureau of Engineering and Surveys. After starting his own firm in 1903, thanks to the contract granted by his brother-in-law, Johnson churned out dozens of public buildings during his tenure.  Among them were the City Hall Annex (now the Notary Hotel), the Philadelphia General Hospital, the Philadelphia Hospital for Mental Diseases at Byberry. and the old Philadelphia Convention Center on Civic Center Boulevard.  After Durham’s demise in 1909, several Philadelphia mayors tried to get Johnson’s lifetime contract overturned. The courts consistently sided with Johnson, and as a result more than $2 million worth of projects flowed into the architect’s office until his death in 1933. Protected from competitive bids, Johnson made few efforts to hide the wealth garnered from the city coffers, belonging to the Philadelphia City Yacht Club and the Larchmont Yacht Club in the suburbs of New York City.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>World’s Greatest Philanthropy<br>
The Shrine was unstoppable in the early 1900s. Membership grew rapidly and the geographical range of Temples widened. The first Shrine Circus opened in 1906 in Detroit. During the same period, there was growing member support for establishing an official Shrine charity. Most Temples had individual philanthropies, and sometimes the Shrine as an organization gave aid. After the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco, the Shrine sent $25,000 to help the stricken city and in 1915, the Shrine contributed $10,000 for the relief of European war victims. But neither the individual projects nor the special one-time contributions satisfied the membership who wanted to do more.<br>

<br>
One of Kendrick's first actions after being elected as mayor in 1923 was to recruit Marine Corps Brigadier General Smedley Butler to serve as Philadelphia's Director of Public Safety, to enforce Prohibition and vice laws. After a contentious two years, Kendrick dismissed Butler on December 22, 1925.<br>
<br>
Kendrick was also an active Shriner, serving as Potentate of Lulu Shrine from 1906–18, and again from 1920–23. He was elected Imperial Potentate from 1919–20 and served as the second chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Shriners from 1934–49.[7] While he was serving as Imperial Potentate, he put forth the resolution that created the Shriners Hospitals for Children.[8] From 1949 until his death, he served on the board of trustees for the Philadelphia Shriners Hospital.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As one of revolutionary America’s first capitals as well as the gathering place for its Founding Fathers leading to the Declaration of Independence and US Constitution, Philadelphia is increasingly emerging as a leading economic and cultural hub for the East coast. It also remains a traditional diplomatic focal point with 48 consular representations, including Switzerland. America editor William Dowell explores the extraordinary role of Christine Pfister, Berne’s honorary consul, who is helping to change the city’s global artistic profile.<br>
<br>
...Today, Pfister is Switzerland’s honorary consul in Philadelphia and the director of Pentimenti, one of the city’s most respected galleries focusing on emerging contemporary art. Her clients range from local art fanatics to collectors in Switzerland, Paris and the Middle East to the far flung reaches of the planet. She has done a number of exchange programs with museums and galleries in Switzerland, and she is a leading presence in some of America’s most important contemporary art fairs. Her next project is the upcoming Art Fair in Abu Dhabi, which will coincide with the opening of the Louvre’s satellite museum in the emirate.<br>
<br>
..Pfister’s career and her success at a time when many art galleries are threatened with closing, happened almost by chance. She had been going to school in San Francisco and traveled around most of the Western United States, including Hawaii, when a friend suggested taking a trip to Philadelphia. The friend wanted her to meet another Swiss friend, Tom Pfister, who was engaged in marketing for the leading German software company, SAP, which at the time had a headquarters in Switzerland.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">SAP had only one American client, but it was a big one: the multinational science and engineering giant, DuPont. </span>DuPont demanded that if SAP wanted its business, it would have to post someone to the US to meet its needs.<br>
<br>
Tom Pfister had signed on for a three-year tour in 1991. It turned out that Pfister had interests that went beyond business. While studying marketing in Geneva, he had developed a passion for art and enrolled in night classes to study drawing and painting. Landing in Philadelphia, with only one client, he had an urge to expand his horizons. A friend, who had studied at the auction house Christies, suggested that he take over a vacant storefront in Philadelphia’s Old City, and open a gallery. It would be a great way of inserting himself into the creative community.<br>
<br>
ART BASEL: MAKING ART FAIRS SUCCESSFUL<br>
<br>
When she finally took over Pentimenti, she had a broad vision of the latest trends in new and emerging art. The focus became more specific as she gathered experience. She was particularly interested in emerging artists. “When you go to Art Basel, which is the major reason that Art fairs are so successful,” she says, “you see artists who are already established in their careers. What I am interested in is the artists who have not yet reached that point. I enjoy working with the artists, and at times helping them to go ahead with a project that they might not have finished because they didn’t have the financing or enough support.”<br>
<br>
..SWITZERLAND: PHILADELPHIA’S SIXTH MOST IMPORTANT INVESTOR<br>
<br>
Tom Pfister originally had a three-year visa to work in the US. When the time was up, SAP asked him to stay, enabling him to secure him a resident Green Card. He eventually left SAP to start his own international marketing company, Match Code, and only recently started a second company, Nitro Marketing. In 2011, the Swiss government asked Christine Pfister to become its honorary consul in Philadelphia. She subsequently joined the board of directors of the Consular Corps, which represents the honorary consuls of 35 countries in the city that served as America’s original capital. She recently resigned from those duties in order to have more time to spend on other projects.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SUMMARY: This post is really a continuation of my previous post : On arrested former UNICEF official Peter Dalglish, Street Kids International, Plan UK and some very royal connections . Further research into one of the Plan UK board members led to the globalists' Business Backs Education campaign which is advocating the privatisation of education by companies which need much further scrutiny. Technology firms such as Facebook, seem to be deeply embedded with them.<br>
<br>
This report was published on 14 January 2015, ahead of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, to raise awareness of the Business Backs Education campaign, launched by the Varkey Foundation in partnership with Dubai Cares and UNESCO. The campaign was launched at the Global Education &amp; Skills Forum in March 2014 by President Bill Clinton together with Co-Chairs <span style="color:#FF0040">Jim Hagemann-Snabe, CEO of SAP </span>and Majid Jafar, CEO of Crescent Petroleum.<br>
