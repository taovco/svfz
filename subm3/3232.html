BREAKING: Pennsylvania’s highest court has overturned Bill Cosby’s sex assault conviction after finding that an agreement with a previous prosecutor Kevin Steele, prevented him from being charged. The 83-year-old comedian has served more than two years in prison.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FILE – In this April 26, 2018 file photo, actor and comedian Bill Cosby departs the courthouse after he was found guilty in his sexual assault retrial, at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa. Pennsylvania’s highest court has overturned comedian Bill Cosby’s sex assault conviction. The court said Wednesday that they found an agreement with a previous prosecutor prevented him from being charged in the case. Even that even legal ?<br>
— Pennsylvania’s highest court has overturned comedian Bill Cosby’s conviction <br>
<br>
could this be a reason for his release?<br>
Early Release of Non-Violent Offenders From Prison Provides Hope For Some <br>
<br>
Are these democrats letting each other out?<br>
<br>
The 83-year-old Cosby has served more than two years at a state prison near Philadelphia. He has vowed to <br>
serve his full 10-year sentence rather than acknowledge any remorse over the 2004 encounter.<br>
<br>
Cosby, who was once beloved as “America’s Dad,”  was charged in 2015 when a prosecutor armed with new evidence arrested him days before the 12-year statute of limitations expired.<br>
<br>
35 Women Told Their Stories About Being Assaulted by Cosby, and the Culture That Wouldn’t Listen and then some prosecutor gets a big payoff for doing his job badley...<br>
<br>
 He asked a modeling agent to connect him with young women who were new in town and “financially not doing well”.  If these women agreed to meet up, his deposition suggested, he felt that he had a right to them. Such<br>
 a dam predator!<br>
<br>
Cosby said he was in failing health.  You watch he’ll be the next pervert up on the dance floor.  I hope his wife took the money and ran! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is utter bs!  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Did you know Bill Cosby lived across the street from Jeffrey Epstein. <br>
<br>
He could have seen everything. <br>

Legally, it was the right thing to do. You aren't compelled to testify against yourself in criminal trials, but weirdly you are in civil suits -- sort of? Cosby was entitled to remain silent in a civil suit if his testimony would result in criminal action. The original prosecutor gave him legal immunity from prosecution in exchange for having him testify in a civil suit, because the original prosecutor rightly decided that going forward with a criminal prosecution would fail. No evidence, and contrarian evidence based on the behavior of the accuser. So it was decided that a civil suit would be the best chance for the accuser to receive justice by forcing Cosby to testify without threat of criminal prosecution.<br>
<br>
Then fast forward ten years later and amid the witch hunt "me too" movement, a new prosecutor comes in and decides to throw his immunity from prosecution out the window, and uses his testimony in a civil suit to convict him. THAT is bullshit. You may rightly think Cosby is a piece of shit, but he shouldn't be prosecuted illegally.<br>

Could be. Seems obvious he was railroaded amid the "me too" movement. He was obviously a piece of shit that ran a casting couch, but people act like he was a serial rapist. I haven't done a deep dive into every allegation, but the stories I heard were just that -- casting couch offers that adult women could refuse. The worst I heard was that he grabbed a tit of some model/actress in his hotel room, she left, and filed charges with police. That's legally sexual assault, but not the crime of the century. If some woman had grabbed the crotch of a man after he went to her hotel room, do you think it would make the news or the police would go for a conviction?</div>

Sure. I'm not defending his character or claiming he's innocent. But if he's to be convicted, it should be done legally. Unlike Cosby, Epstein was completely nailed with evidence prostituting underage girls, but the local Jew state attorney Barry Krischer let him off easy. The fed prosecutor Acosta also ended up giving him a sweetheart deal. The whole thing was rotten.<br>

Krischer ended up getting an award from the ADL, by the way.</div>

I think you missed my point.  In all likelihood Weinstein's and Cosby's cases were deliberately messed up by the lawyers for precisely this scenario.  Smoke and mirrors psyop achieved.  The Me Too movement detracted from Epstein and the bigger picture of the spy and blackmail network involving Cosby, Weinstein and Epstein were forgotten in the frenzy.<br>
<br>
You don't have a functioning legal system anymore (if you ever did).</div>
