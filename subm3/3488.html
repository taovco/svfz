Now here comes interesting part of theory, why are those accounts posting balloon pictures?<br>
<br>
Well, I've found very interesting and extremely creepy explanation to this. Could be legit or not, but let's give it a try. I've stumbled upon this article about Stephen King's It, book/movie.<br>
<a href="https://screenrant.com/it-stephen-king-pennywise-balloons-meaning-deadlights-theory/" class="postlink">https://screenrant.com/it-stephen-king- ... ts-theory/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pennywise is often carrying a lot of balloons in IT, and there's a fan theory that offers an interesting meaning to them. Let's take a look.</div></blockquote>

And some other quotes from that article:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>One of the most defining characteristics of Pennywise is that he carries a bunch of balloons (of various colors in the novel, red in the adaptations), which according to a fan theory are more than just an illusion to catch his victims.<br>
Pennywise is just IT’s preferred form, but its actual appearance is a bit complicated to describe. IT is an ancient, cosmic, evil entity that originated in the Macroverse (a void containing and surrounding the universe), and even though it can take the shape of whatever it wants, its true shape is unknown as it only exists in an inter-dimensional realm referred to as “deadlights”<br>
The theory, then, suggests that the balloons are a representation of the deadlights and contain the souls of the children killed by IT.<br>
What makes the balloons float is not helium, but the souls of all the children Pennywise has killed, hence why his famous “they all float down here” quote.</div></blockquote>

I've also read this topic on Stephen King while searching on voat:<br>
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2138127" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2138127</a><br>
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2652214" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2652214</a><br>
Now I don't know what to think but this is quite creepy.<br>
Little addition for the end, is this guy a dope like he suggests here or ... a pedo?<br>

Maggie was linked with Buck Rowdy, weird moderator of subreddits about famous child murder/kidnapping cases and anti-Q subreddits, some users claim that Buck Rowdy is censoring attempts to link JonBenet Ramsey case to bigger pedophile network -&gt;<br>

Valerie Veatch made another film "Love Child" with David Foox who is described as co-producer in all the articles about the film <a href="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/david-foox-valerie-veach-ceo-of-tmobile-john-legere-and-wife-legere-picture-id463373053?s=2048x2048" class="postlink">https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/da ... =2048x2048</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 2010, the 28-year-old filmmaker was in Rome when she caught a BBC News report about a South Korean couple charged with manslaughter after a judge ruled their gaming addiction made them not culpable for the death of their baby, who starved to death as they played an online game called Prius in 12 hour-long stints at a cybercafé...<br>
<br>
The case made headlines around the world and sparked a debate within South Korea – a country with the world’s most advanced information and communication technology economy – around whether online addiction should be categorized as a mental illness.<br>
<br>
Veatch, who previously directed the HBO doc Me @ the Zoo, and <span style="color:#FF0040">co-producer David Foox</span> put together funding through friends, T-Mobile CEO John Legere (credited as an exec producer) and a first-look deal with HBO Documentary Films and flew to South Korean capital Seoul last year for a six-week shoot....<br>
<br>
To give the audience a sense of this collapse between the virtual and the real, Veatch made a controversial decision not to include her interviews with the couple – who had willingly participated in on-camera interviews – or their names and faces.<br>
<br>
Instead, the film uses the tragedy to springboard into a broader exploration of legal, cultural and societal issues around Internet usage by mixing interviews and audio with game footage, visual effects, experimental electronic music, and psychedelic images of Seoul’s labyrinthine cityscape of LED lights and digital screens that paint a Kubrickian portrait of South Korea’s extensive IT infrastructure.
</div></blockquote>

Interesting coincidence coz I just found some stuff on South Korea and the origins of the COVID19 scam... but I'll leave that for now..<br>
<br>
David Foox is also an artist <a href="https://www.saatchiart.com/foox" class="postlink">https://www.saatchiart.com/foox</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>David Foox goes by the artist name FOOX. Born in South Africa and raised partly in the USA and New Zealand, FOOX is most interested in the fabric of our reality and the laws applicable to Universal Reality and philosophy.<br>

<span style="color:#00FF40">ARTIST PROFILE: DAVID FOOX – A NIGHT IN THE DARK TOWER</span> <a href="https://untappedcities.com/2011/08/03/artist-profile-david-foox-a-night-in-the-dark-tower/" class="postlink">https://untappedcities.com/2011/08/03/a ... ark-tower/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...For those not in tune with the New York City art scene, David Foox has earned his place as one of the most prolific and eclectic artists of the past few years... <br>
<br>
...There is an important story and reason behind every project Foox gives himself to. His vinyl toy project <span style="color:#FF0040">Organ Donors</span>  stemmed from a family member with cystic fibrosis, who was miraculously gifted two replacement lungs from a 26-year old iron man athlete who had died too young. Foox was so inspired by it that he decided to create an entire toy series that would raise not just awareness for organ donation, but charity money as well...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/njet7s.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

Foox’s current “FOLLOW” project, which blends more traditional art with an expansive street art movement, features scores of long-eared rabbits, often dressed in suits and uniforms. I knew the project had obvious ties to 2011 being the year of the rabbit, but I wanted to know more; so I asked Foox how the project had started and what it was all about.<br>
<br>
He told me that it had all started with a ram. Foox wanted to do a series on rams with long, horizontal horns because they were steeped in historical folklore and esoteric understanding. When he finished, he was soon made aware that the ram’s horns had evil connotations; that the piece itself was exuding a ton of negative energy. Discovering that he could use the ram’s face and put it naturally on a rabbit’s body, the project took a 180. “Rabbits have a positive connotation, even though they’re a creature of the night, and are traditionally associated with the occult,” David told us. It seemed a natural fit....<br>
<br>
Foox suggests that the New York he sees outside his window, the pristine views of Governor’s Island, the Statue of Liberty and the massive skyscrapers of the financial district, was built because our civilization was able to “shut out thought.” He says our society is one of worker bees and ants rejecting free thought in lieu of “advancement.”<br>
<br>
He believes all that a great awakening of consciousness is coming, and he wants to be a part of it, promising to keep tagging until his message is “etched into the collective consciousness. I can’t imagine a more fitting place for Foox to work to pervade the lives and minds of America’s worker bees than an office that once housed scores of discontented businessmen trapped in colorless cubicles, an office that was also once the set of the film Wall Street 2.<br>
<br>
So what’s next for David? At the moment, he’s working on a secret, innovative project codenamed <span style="color:#FF0040">“the Rothschild.”</span> “It’s a new type of wallet in which your money gets folded in a magical way that makes it last longer,” states David. The Rothschild wallet is based upon stories Andy Warhol told his friends about how the Rothschild family would fold their cash in a specific manner to lengthen its life. Soon, everyone will be able to fold and carry their cash in the same esoteric way the Rothschilds did. “And it’s fun,” said David, smiling wickedly.<br>
<br>
He’s also planning a project for the year of the dragon, 2012. As the dragon is the only magical creature of the zodiac, Foox believes 2012 is going to be a “magical year full of political and commercial shifts,” that it will be <span style="color:#FF0040">“China’s time to shine.”</span> How will the year of the dragon manifest itself into Foox’s work? “I was thinking maybe through sculpture,” Foox told us. “When I imagine dragons, I imagine them in 3D. What do you guys think?” Constantly exploring new mediums and always willing to learn something from those who show interest in him and his work, Foox is truly an artist of the people.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Suddenly the internet is a hot topic at the Sundance Film Festival. Could it be because our online narratives just as important as our offline ones?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/u6vvs8.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

WHEN DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER Valerie Veatch took a vacation to Rome with her grandmother in 2010, she wasn't really looking for her next big project. But while taking in the city she caught something shocking on the news: A 3-month-old baby had starved to death while her parents were raising a virtual child in the popular online game Prius at an internet café in South Korea.<br>
<br>
It stuck with her. In the intervening years she completed her first feature documentary Me @ the Zoo, a film about viral video star Chris "Leave Britney alone!" Crocker, and took it to the Sundance Film Festival, where it got picked up by HBO Documentary Films. But she couldn't shake the story of baby Kim Sa-rang and her parents. In June 2012, she headed to South Korea—a nation with nearly total broadband penetration and, according to government estimates, tens of thousands of cases of internet addiction—and came back with the documentary Love Child, which premieres at Sundance today.<br>
<br>
It's a movie that's nominally about the case of Kim Yun-jeong and Kim Jae-beom, but more broadly about how our lives offline are becoming inextricably intertwined with our online ones. Jumping off from the Kims' trial—which ended in two-year sentences for the couple due in part to an internet addiction defense—Love Child illustrates the difficulty in defining how much time online is too much...<br>
<br>
"[It] might sound obvious, but I think we really used to think of the internet as separate, some distant realm of geeks and hackers," said Internet's Own Boy director Brian Knappenberger. "We can't think of the internet as separate anymore, it is the key component to the way we live. … The next logical step is to get serious about our values and civil liberties and make sure they are stitched into the code of our new world. It's easy to see that this kind of surveillance overreach affects all other issues people care about."<br>
<br>
A time may also come when films themselves will be presented in virtual reality as well. The Oculus team will be at the festival showing off how their Rift VR headset can be used to immerse viewers in things like Beck's 360-degree "Sound and Vision" video. "This is a way that technology can really change the way a story is told," Frilot said.<br>
<br>
After almost an hour of talking about virtual worlds with Veatch, I ask her what it is she hopes people take away from her documentary, which premieres on HBO later this year. Surprisingly, this takes her back to Rome. She mentions something she read about Pope Francis granting indulgences—time off from purgatory—via Twitter. Then she quotes from an online piece that points out that, whether he knew it or not, the Pope agreed with media theorist Nathan Jurgenson's rejection of the idea that the virtual world is a distinct space separate from the physical one.<br>
<br>
"I think that's the point of the movie," Veatch concluded. "There's no difference between the virtual world and the real world, and this couple was not held responsible for their crime because the virtual world is truly so engaging to their neurological system that they just couldn't override it. There's something really powerful about that kind of reality."</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Papal court handling pardons for sins says contrite Catholics may win 'indulgences' by following World Youth Day on Twitter<br>
<br>
In its latest attempt to keep up with the times the Vatican has married one of its oldest traditions to the world of social media by offering "indulgences" to followers of Pope Francis' tweets.<br>
<br>
The church's granted indulgences reduce the time Catholics believe they will have to spend in purgatory after they have confessed and been absolved of their sins...<br>
<br>
"You can't obtain indulgences like getting a coffee from a vending machine," Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, head of the pontifical council for social communication, told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera...<br>
<br>
But attendance at events such as the Catholic World Youth Day, in Rio de Janeiro, a week-long event starting on 22 July, can also win an indulgence.<br>
<br>
Mindful of the faithful who cannot afford to fly to Brazil, the Vatican's sacred apostolic penitentiary, a court which handles the forgiveness of sins, has also extended the privilege to those following the "rites and pious exercises" of the event on television, radio and through social media.<br>
<br>
"That includes following Twitter," said a source at the penitentiary, referring to Pope Francis' Twitter account, which has gathered seven million followers. "But you must be following the events live. It is not as if you can get an indulgence by chatting on the internet."<br>
<br>
.."What really counts is that the tweets the Pope sends from Brazil or the photos of the Catholic World Youth Day that go up on Pinterest produce authentic spiritual fruit in the hearts of everyone," said Celli.</div></blockquote>

Wow, that's creepy.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The congregation is known for its commitment to social justice, notably through its support of immigration justice, voter advocacy, environmentalism, the LGBT community, and <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">the Black Lives Matter movement</span></span>.<br>
<br>
The Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York is a congregation within the Unitarian Universalist Association located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. It is the last surviving of seven Universalist congregations in the city, founded on the belief of universal salvation that emphasized the love of God for all people. ..<br>
<br>
The congregation began in 1838 as New York City's fourth society devoted to the Universalist faith (the previous three were founded in 1796, 1830 and 1832, respectively). The congregation's original name was Friends of the Final Restitution and in 1848, it changed its name to the Church of the Divine Paternity. It officially took the name of Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York in 1967. Over the years it has attracted notable personalities such as P. T. Barnum, Horace Greeley, Oscar Hammerstein II, Louise Whitfield Carnegie, Lou Gehrig, Barbara Gittings, and Winifred Latimer Norman to its pews.[1]<br>
<br>
In 1898, the congregation built its current home, dubbed "the Cathedral of Universalism," at West 76th Street and Central Park West on New York City's Upper West Side. The architect, William Appleton Potter, based the design closely upon Magdalen Tower, Oxford, and buildings at Magdalen College. In 1993 Robert A. M. Stern and his co-authors described the church as "one of the few buildings to break from Central Park West's prevailing Classicism."[2][3] A rare design in English Perpendicular Gothic, it received praise from notable architects including <span style="color:#FF0040">Frank Lloyd Wright, whose daughter was married at the church. </span>The church houses several significant artistic works, including an altar by Louis Comfort Tiffany, a bronze relief sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a mosaic by J&amp;R Lamb Studios, and stained glass windows by Clayton and Bell of London. The organ was donated by Andrew Carnegie and his wife, Louise Carnegie, the latter who was a member of the church.[4] Originally designed and constructed by the Hutchings-Votey Organ Company of Boston, the organ was rebuilt and revised by the Ernest M. Skinner Company...<br>
<br>
On May 1, 2016 the congregation called the Rev. Schuyler Vogel to become its next Senior Minister.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John Mervyn Guthrie Griffith-Jones CBE MC (1 July 1909 – 13 July 1979[1]) was a British judge and former barrister. He led the prosecution of Penguin Books in the obscenity trial in 1960 following the publication of D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. His much quoted remark in his opening statement as to whether the novel was something "you would even wish your wife or servants to read" is often cited as representing the extent to which the British establishment had fallen out of touch with popular opinion at the time.[2] He failed to convince the jury at the Chatterley trial, and the publishers were acquitted.<br>
<br>
Griffith-Jones was born in Hampstead, London.[3] His father, John Stanley Phillips Griffith-Jones (1877/8–1949), was also a barrister. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in 1932, specialising in criminal law. He served with the Coldstream Guards during the Second World War, and was awarded the Military Cross in 1943. <span style="color:#FF0040">After the war, he was one of the British prosecuting counsel at the Nuremberg Trials (as Junior Counsel)<br>
</span> ..<br>
<br>
In 1963 he was the prosecuting counsel in the trial of Stephen Ward, who was accused of living off the immoral earnings of Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies following the Profumo affair.[10] Ward took a drugs overdose on the last day of the trial, and died on 3 August after being convicted in his absence...<br>
<br>
Griffith-Jones was a councillor in Westminster City Council from 1948 to 1954, and became a Lord Lieutenant in the City of London in 1967. He was appointed CBE in 1977. He was also an accomplished artist, and held three exhibitions in London in the 1970s... His son, <span style="color:#FF0040">Robin Griffith-Jones, is the current Reverend and Valiant Master of the Temple.</span> Griffith-Jones's aunt, Anne Griffith-Jones, was founder of the Tanglin Trust School, Singapore</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Robin Griffith-Jones is the Reverend and Valiant Master of the Temple at the Temple Church, and a Senior Lecturer in Theology at King’s College London. His chief care is for those who work or live in the Temple, the services of the Church, and its roles in the life of the Temple, London and the nation through the 850 years of its history to the present day.<br>
<br>
Robin worked at the <span style="color:#FF0040">auctioneers Christies on leaving Oxford in 1978</span>. After working, <span style="color:#FF0040">1984-6, with Mother Theresa’s Sisters in India</span> and with the long-term homeless in London, Robin studied theology in Cambridge. He served as Curate (assistant minister) in outer Liverpool, 1989-92 and as Chaplain at Lincoln College, Oxford University, 1992-9. Robin was appointed Master of the Temple in 1999.<br>
<br>
Robin has published widely on the New Testament, and on law and religion and architectural history. His books on the New Testament and early Christendom are The Four Witnesses (about the gospels,2000), The Gospel according to Paul (2004), The Da Vinci Code and the Secrets of the Temple (2006), and Mary Magdalene (2008, with the title Beloved Disciple in the USA). All are available through amazon.com. Robin admits wryly that his little book on The Da Vinci Code has sold more copies than will ever be sold of all his other books together!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The Temple Church is famous as ‘the mother-church of the Common Law’</span>. Robin ran the public discussions on Islam and English Law which began with the then Archbishop of Canterbury’s famous lecture on sharia law in the UK. Robin edited the consequent book, Islam and English Law (2013).<br>
<br>
The Temple played a central role in the gestation of Magna Carta, and in the spread of the Charter’s principles to America and throughout the world. In the Temple Church itself, in use by 1162, are the effigies of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and hero of Runnymede, and of his son the 2nd Earl, one of the Charter’s Surety Barons. Robin co-edited Magna Carta, Religion and the Rule of Law (2015), edited and produced the widely-read booklet Magna Carta, 1215-2015 and curated the Magna Carta exhibition that is still on show at the Temple Church.<br>
<br>
The Temple Church itself is one of London’s famously historic and beautiful churches; its Round Church is modelled on the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Robin co-edited The Temple Church: History, Architecture, Art (2013) and Tomb and Temple: Re-Imagining the Sacred Buildings of Jerusalem (2017).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A rather perfunctory new Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) report circulating in the Kremlin today noting President Putin’s strong condemnation of the horrific New Zealand massacre whose death toll is at least 49, has appended to it a beyond shocking Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) national security file on the mass murder shooter behind this massacre Brenton Tarrant—that most critically notes he’s an Australian citizen first “acquired/targeted” by SVR surveillance in May-2017 while he was visiting Western Europe—most specifically due to his visit to the headquarters of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)—otherwise known as MI6—located at 85 Albert Embankment in Vauxhall, a south western part of central London—and after leaving, saw Tarrant traveling about 5 kilometers (a little over 3 miles) to Temple--London EC4Y 7BB where he entered <span style="color:#FF0040">Temple Church (built by the Knights Templar as their English headquarters in 1185)</span> where he met privately with <span style="color:#FF0040">Master of the Temple <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Robin Griffith-Jones</span></span>—the significance of which was unknown until a few hours ago when Tarrant posted his 73-page manifesto titled “The Great Replacement” wherein he declared “no group ordered my attack…I make the decision myself…though I did contact the reborn Knights Templar for a blessing in support of the attack, which was given”.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]<br>
<br>
..Unbeknownst to the SVR at the time Brenton Tarrant visited MI6 headquarters and Temple Church in Spring-2017, this report notes, was that he had already been “psychologically damaged” by a radical Islamic terrorist truck ramming attack that occurred in Stockholm-Sweden on 7 April 2017—the youngest of whose 4 dead victims was a girl-child named Ebba Akerlund—and whom Tarrant dedicated his New Zealand massacre to by his proclaiming he was doing it in order “to take revenge for Ebba Akerlund a 12-year-old Swedish girl”.<br>
<br>
To the truest motivations of Brenton Tarrant in conducting this mass killing, however, this report continues, SVR intelligence analysts say at this time is unknowable—and is due to his “The Great Replacement” manifesto being what is called a “shitposting” document—which is the act of throwing out huge amounts of content for the purpose of provoking an emotional reaction—some of whose examples include:<br>
<br>
Tarrant vowing to take “revenge” against Muslim “invaders” and writing he was inspired by right-wing terrorist Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011.<br>
<br>
Tarrant writing that “Spyro the dragon 3 taught me ethno-nationalism…Fortnite trained me to be a killer and to floss on the corpses of my enemies”.<br>
<br>
Tarrant declaring himself to be a “eco-fascist” who advocates “green nationalism” and urges people to kill “high profile enemies”—saying that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is “the mother of all things anti-white and anti-germanic, is top of the list”.<br>
<br>
Tarrant trashing “suicidal, nihilistic and degenerate pop icons produced from a dead culture” mentioning Michael Jackson, Madonna, Kurt Cobain, and Freddie Mercury.<br>
<br>
Tarrant directly declaring to “Antifa/Marxists/Communists” that: “I do not want to convert you…I want you in my sights. I want your neck under my boot”.<br>
<br>
Tarrant further declaring “There is no nation in the world that wasn’t founded by, or maintained by, the use of force. Force is power. History is the history of power. Violence is power and violence is the reality of history. Wake up”...

The Ancient Society of College Youths (ASCY) is a change ringing society, founded in 1637 and based in the City of London.[1] The society played a leading role in the early development of change ringing, and today provides ringers for important events at St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In the list of issues that tear families apart, religion, money and unwelcome marriage figure near the top. Lord Marks, the multi-married, multi-millionaire, once a pillar of the Jewish community, more recently a convert to the Greek Orthodox church, managed to combine all three in one huge, hurtful schism, the repercussions of which will resound for years.<br>
<br>
Lord Marks of Broughton, 78, scion of the Marks &amp; Spencer dynasty with a fortune estimated at £30 million sterling died recently. His funeral was held in the grand Byzantine surroundings of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St Sophia in Bayswater, just a couple of miles from the family firm's London headquarters. But none of his family was present, aside from <span style="color:#FF0040">Marina, his glamorous 44-year-old Greek wife of just four years.</span><br>
<br>
Those who were there put a brave face on the no-shows, claiming the unimpressive congregation of 70 mourners made the atmosphere more intimate. An English and Byzantine choir sang Marks's favourite hymns, including some used in the funeral of the Princess of Wales. A friend broke into a spontaneous mouth organ recital...<br>
<br>
The fifth Lady Marks cannot have been surprised when his blood relations, including his three children, failed to appear. They had also snubbed the couple's wedding. And little more than two years after the nuptials, his son Simon launched an extraordinary legal action demanding Marina return "gifts, money and property" given to her by his father, claiming she exerted "undue influence" over him. Lord Marks, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, was made a ward of the Court of Protection as Simon alleged his father had no idea how much of his wealth he had handed over to his young wife...<br>
<br>
Simon, and his sisters Naomi and Sarah, are now arranging their own memorial service for their father, to be held next month at the West London Synagogue. It will be an invitation-only affair, and Lady M will not be holding her breath for hers to drop through the letterbox, even though she would like to attend. "She was expecting the family to go to the funeral service", said her lawyer, John Millar. "And of course she would be pleased to accept an invitation to be at the memorial service."<br>
<br>
They are said to blame her for the conversion of Marks, a leading member of one of Britain's best-known Jewish families, to Greek Orthodoxy. She disputes the claim. "He made up his own mind," says Millar, before the couple married, and she was as surprised about his decision as everybody else.<br>
<br>
.....He inherited his father's title in 1964, specialised in painting chickens, and in 1994 held his first and only gallery exhibition. It made £8,000, which he told gallery owner Ritsa Kyriacou was the first money he had earned in his own right in his life...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">His first marriage, to Rothschild heiress Ann Pinto,</span> produced his three children, but lasted only eight years. His second wife was Helene Fischer, but that marriage lasted just two years. Then in 1976 came a nine-year marriage to Japanese Toshiko Shimura. His fourth trip to the altar was with Liying Chang, from China...<br>
<br>
...There are also allegations that she has cut out donations to pro-Israeli causes. More nonsense, says the solicitor: "Until he met my client,<span style="color:#FF0040"> Lord Marks never supported causes in Israel." Indeed, he adds, it was her influence and background - her father was founder of a Greek-Israeli charity - that made Lord Marks start sending cash to Jewish causes.</span><br>
<br>
Recently, in line with the legal agreement reached with his stepmother two years ago, the new Baron Marks of Broughton was saying nothing and speaking to no one - especially not his stepmother.</div></blockquote>

Ask not for whom the bells of Hampstead Heath toll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121114123632/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3648514/Ask-not-for-whom-the-bells-of-Hampstead-Heath-toll.html" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20121114123 ... -toll.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Michael White on the sound of village life<br>
<br>
John Betjeman was summoned by bells. Quasimodo was deafened by them. And somewhere in between, the residents of a select neighbourhood in north London wonder what will happen to their Sunday lie-ins after a ceremony today at which the local bishop will dedicate a new peal of bells at Christ Church, Hampstead.<br>
<br>
I know about this because I'm one of the residents. And I'm looking forward to it. As a neighbour eulogised the prospect, 'It's the sound of English Sundays, church bells. The sound of village life. If anyone objects, they might as well object to birdsong.'<br>
<br>
But the truth is, Hampstead Village life has been without bells long enough for people not to miss them. Christ Church is a 19th-century pile built big on the assumption that Hampstead Heath would be developed for housing, and with a grand bell tower that once rang out for coronations, ends of years and ends of wars, until - like so many other towers - it fell silent when the bells got unsafe.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">But five years ago, a 20-year-old student, Michael Royalton-Kisch, turned up and said: 'I want to ring bells. Yours don't work. If I can raise the money, will you let me install eight new ones?' </span>Thinking it would never happen, the vicar said OK. To universal amazement, this youth single-handedly drummed up £100,000, charming it from Hampstead's colourful community. The late Jock Murray, publisher of Betjeman, gave a bell. The psychic scientist Rupert Sheldrake and his wife, who teaches inner peace through chanting, gave another. My neighbour Peter Evans, who hears bells as birdsong, gave four.<br>
<br>
It's rare these days to get a heavy eight-bell peal installed. And eight bells can apparently generate 40,320 changes through a continuous span of 27 hours.<br>
<br>
'We're going carefully with the neighbours,' said churchwarden Jane Cox, mindful that Hampstead is full of lawyers who know their way around the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. Christ Church has taken care to install sound-dampers to muffle practice nights. But Jane Cox clings to the hope that 'people will thrill to the noise. It'll be like a cathedral booming across the Heath, which happens to be part of our parish. I can imagine people falling to their knees.'<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there are usually quite enough people on their knees among the bushy deeps of Hampstead Heath, and their reasons are not spiritual. Let's hope that they hear the bells of Christ Church as a warning.

Benjamin Britten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Britten#Controversies" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_ ... troversies</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Edward Benjamin Britten, Baron Britten OM CH (22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976) was an English composer, conductor, and pianist. He was a central figure of 20th-century British music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera Peter Grimes (1945), the War Requiem (1962) and the orchestral showpiece The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945)...<br>
<br>
Controversies<br>
Boys<br>
Throughout his adult life, Britten had a particular rapport with children and enjoyed close friendships with several boys, particularly those in their early teens.[n 12] The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, 13 years old in 1934 when Britten was aged 20.[145] Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s.[146] Hemmings later said, "In all of the time that I spent with him he never abused that trust", and Crawford wrote "I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man ... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people. He loved music, and loved youngsters caring about music."[27][n 13]<br>
<br>
It was long suspected by several of Britten's close associates that there was something exceptional about his attraction to teenage boys: Auden referred to Britten's "attraction to thin-as-a-board juveniles ... to the sexless and innocent",[148] and Pears once wrote to Britten: "remember there are lovely things in the world still – children, boys, sunshine, the sea, Mozart, you and me".[149] In public, the matter was little discussed during Britten's lifetime and much discussed after it...</div></blockquote>

That's Lucy Charlesworth, daughter of jazz musician Dick Charlesworth : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Charlesworth" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Charlesworth</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Charlesworth left the Civil Service in 1959 and became a professional musician. He signed a recording contract with EMI and his group was remarketed as 'Dick Charlesworth's City Gents'. This was the time when light jazz was popular in the British charts as typified by Acker Bilk and Kenny Ball, also attired in distinctive costumes. Charlesworth's group sported pin stripes and bowler hats, and had a Latin motto, Dum vivimus vivamus, (“While we live, let us enjoy life”).[2] Their only chart single was "Billy Boy",which reached 43 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1961.[5] The City Gents often appeared on television including The Morecambe and Wise Show and Sunday Night at the London Palladium.[3] Charlesworth sang the title song of a comedy film, In the Doghouse, starring Leslie Phillips and featured in his own 15 minute musical short in 1963..</div></blockquote>

As we step into 2016 it’s looking as if we’ll have a lot of new experiences coming our way. Firstly, it’s an Olympic year which given our past work with sponsors Omega, GE and Coca-Cola certainly bodes well for us spending some time in Rio in the summer. We know we’re in for a busy start to the year with a good amount of work already in the diary: we’re running brainstorming sessions around content for the International Olympic Committee, we’re media training a new large corporate client, and have dates in the diary to meet with fashion and automotive brands who are looking for new video partners. All whilst delivering a range of projects for <span style="color:#FF0040">our trusted clients Diageo, Coca-Cola, and law firm Mishcon de Reya.<br>
We have all just returned from Bangalore where we celebrated Sitara’s wedding in true style – so energy is high and January is off to a flying start. Here’s to a strong 2016 – happy new year, everyone!<br>

Its 80 employees set up more than 400 events and meetings (“interactions”) across CES, a weeklong festival for gadgets and, increasingly, deal makers.<br>
<br>
Their job: To grease the wheels of communication between old media and new tech (i.e., help Conde Nast figure out how to deal with Snapchat), make introductions, headhunt for executives and advise on strategy.<br>
<br>
As one observer said at CES, they’re paid to introduce people to people they already know.<br>
<br>
Consider: <span style="color:#FF0040">MediaLink works for J.P. Morgan Chase, GE, Unilever, Kraft, AT&amp;T, the New York Times, Conde Nast and Time Inc.</span>, among others. Prices for their services range from the lowest end of $500,000 a year to many millions. “You will find we are much lower than most consulting firms,” Millard told me one night. “Very reasonable, given what we do.”<br>
<br>
They’re the media world’s shadowy overlords, puppet masters behind almost every deal in the modern media landscape — and every viral mozzarella stick on your Facebook feed.<br>
<br>
“I would call them the human routers,” said AOL’s CEO Tim Armstrong, who arrived at MediaLink’s Monday and Tuesday night CES parties along with his “digital prophet,” Shingy. “They route more information around in our industry that any other single organization.”<br>
<br>
Dawn Ostroff, president of Conde Nast Entertainment said: “Somehow they have their tentacles in every facet. MediaLink takes over CES. They set up the meetings. They’re the hub. The tech, the media, the ads.”<br>
<br>
..Millard and Kassan have certainly been around a long time. Millard, MediaLink’s president and COO, says there’s virtually no one over 35 in the sales business who hasn’t worked for her. She was on the founding team of DoubleClick before joining Yahoo as chief sales officer, and became co-CEO and president of media for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.<br>
<br>
Kassan, the founder and CEO, has a more varied background. He was a very large franchisee of El Pollo Loco and Rally’s Hamburgers (a part of his career that contained some level of controversy), became president of home video company International Video Entertainment, practiced law, and joined Western International Media (which later became Initiative Media Worldwide) as president. Later, he left and sued its parent company, Interpublic Group for defamation, a dispute now settled ..<br>
<br>
“They led our media agency review, and did a workshop on Big Data and marketing — standard consulting, really, but you trust what they say because, and it sounds odd, but because they just know everyone,” said Andrew Markowitz, who leads the Global Digital Strategy Group at GE...<br>
<br>
In a converted bedroom of the Wynn’s Fairway Villas in Las Vegas during CES, over a bowl of Hershey’s mini chocolates, Applebee’s Dugan and other MediaLink food-industry clients, including Tyson, the frozen-chicken company, met with ad tech companies I had never heard of (NewsCred, Sharethrough, Unified Social). The execs wanted to know how to use Facebook ads and viral campaigns to make people buy their food or come to their restaurants...<br>
<br>
In the MediaLink-controlled C Space at the Aria, the “war room” was stocked with a table full of cold cuts, Krispy Kreme doughnuts and Tylenol.<br>
<br>
Next door, 30 representatives from J.P. Morgan were taking careful notes as they listened to Lucas Watson, VP of global brand solutions &amp; innovations at Google. This was the meat of the MediaLink programming — a special lesson for the old world (J.P Morgan) on the new world (Google)...<br>
<br>
Foxtail at the SLS Hotel: This is not a party<br>
MediaLink goes to great pains not to be thought of as a party planner, but it does plan the most powerful party at CES — many people fly in for this event alone. The Tuesday night party for more than 250 guests is their most exclusive event.<br>
<br>
“They throw the most coveted party at <span style="color:#FF0040">Cannes every year, at the Hotel du Cap</span>. Nobody will mess with their night,” said Desiree Gruber, the producer of “Project Runway.” “Every other night is negotiable but theirs.”...<br>
<br>
“I stand out here because I’m 5′2″, and otherwise I get dozens of emails the next morning — ‘Where were you? I didn’t see you!'” said Millard, in pearls and a glittering pink, almost metallic Kate Spade dress. “See and be seen!”<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Salesforce founder Marc Benioff </span>walked past. Millard undid the rope to let someone in past the line. “Just this once,” she said in her southern drawl, “because you have the best hair in the business.”<br>
<br>
..“Kassan is kind of a god in this world,” said Shapiro, the president of CES, who was having a drink with Benioff. “He’s like a Bill Clinton.”</div></blockquote>

Last Night in London, Brandon Maxwell Opened a One-Night-Only Club With Moda Operandi <a href="https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/london-brandon-maxwell-club-moda-operandi" class="postlink">https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/london- ... a-operandi</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>London art week follows fast on fashion month, and with the colorful worlds colliding, it was perfect timing for Brandon Maxwell to breeze into town and put on his dancing shoes as he celebrated with “Brandon’s”—a pink neon-fronted nightclub, like a Frieze-style apparition on Bruton Lane. Guests including Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis, Devon Radziwill, and Martina Mondadori were checked in and given black velvet wristbands to the bijou nightclub. Inside, the scene was straight out of a ’80s music video. Charlotte Dellal, dressed in a svelte gold satin dress, was chatting at the bar with Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece over French 75s.<br>
<br>
It was a rare treat to have the Texan designer in London, due to his acute fear of flying. “I just hate flying over water! I told Lauren [Santo Domingo] she had to sedate me to get me here,” joked Maxwell, but the savvy style maven was determined to get Maxwell to London to celebrate his latest collection—from which Santo Domingo has ordered the foil lamé dress and a white cotton shirtdress...<br>
<br>
Brandon’s may have been for one night only, but the great and the good certainly joined the party. There was Tatiana Santo Domingo, Natalie Massenet, Erik Torstensson, Jacquetta Wheeler, and Hayley Bloomingdale. With the same pulsating energy he brings to his runway shows, there was also surprise entertainment from Crystal and Vinegar Strokes from RuPaul’s Drag Race UK, ensuring a raucous dance-off denouement...</div></blockquote>

Tatiana Santo Domingo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatiana_Santo_Domingo" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatiana_Santo_Domingo</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Tatiana Santo Domingo Rechulski (born 24 November 1983), also known as Tatiana <span style="color:#FF0040">Casiraghi</span>, is an American-born Colombian-Monégasque socialite, heiress and fashion designer. She is the founder of Muzungu Sisters, a fashion company and the wife of <span style="color:#FF0040">Andrea Casiraghi</span>, who is fourth in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne. On the Forbes 2016 list of the world's billionaires, she was ranked #722 with an estimated net worth of US$2.4 billion..<br>
<br>
Tatiana Santo Domingo was born on 24 November 1983 in New York and raised in Geneva and Paris. She is a member of the Santo Domingo family. Her father Julio Mario Santo Domingo, Jr. (1958–2009) was the son of Julio Mario Santo Domingo (1923–2011), who was cited as the second richest man in Colombia by Forbes in 2011.[2] Her grandfather was owner of the Santo Domingo Group and the Colombian Bavaria Brewery, which was one of the largest breweries in South America. When he died in 2011, he left a sixth of his wealth to Tatiana Santo Domingo.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Pierre Casiraghi ferried Thunberg across the Atlantic in his carbon-neutral boat.<br>
<br>
..So what do his fellow Grimaldis think of his latest endeavor? Casiraghi points out that this kind of thing runs in his blood. "My ancestor was the first admiral of the French king against the English in the Hundred Years’ War." His grandfather, Prince Rainier II, was also good buddies with Jacques Cousteau.<br>
<br>
So Pierre Casiraghi is part of the Monaco royal family and his grandfather was 'good buddies with Jacques Cousteau'. Do you know that he's also connected to Nicole Junkermann? Let's take a look.<br>
<br>
Pierre is married to Beatrice dei Principi Borromeo Arese Taverna. She is the half-sister of Isabella Borromeo Arese Taverna who is married to Ugo Brachettit Peretti, the brother of Ferdinando, Nicole Junkermann's husband.

Through her father she is related to Carlo Borromeo (1538–1584), who became a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop of Milan, and a canonized saint. The family currently owns most of the Borromean Islands in the Lago Maggiore, Milan city, and many other estates in the Lombardy and Piedmont countryside .</div></blockquote>

In early 2019 after extensive research I've identified Juliane E. Min aka nabiya as one of the potential persons who could be on the picture of James Alefantis from Turkey where woman suspiciously stares at James Alefantis phone and she herself takes a picture (?) of herself and little girl behind her - both woman and little girl were not mentioned on any other occassion. Nabiya resembles woman but this is not conclusive, just one of (probably) many many potential people:<br>

<br>
30 weeks before, James Alefantis posted pictures from Turkey in August (?) 2015<br>
<br>

<br>
As you can see he took picture of that woman ( I'll get to this later ) and little girl beside her. He says: selfie with "jscottdesign2" and "lukepbrown". As we know, jscottdesign2 is J Scott Cunnigham, Luke P. Brown is the guy from the Cuba picture. And I'll post pictures to get you a clue what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
There's Alefantis in Venice: <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet0891.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et0891.png</a> 56 weeks before the pictures were archived ( November 2016 )<br>
<br>
With Luke P. Brown <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet0901.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et0901.png</a><br>
<br>
He's in Washington: <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet0941.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et0941.png</a><br>
<br>
He's in Berlin: <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet0951.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et0951.png</a><br>
<br>
Then in New York ... <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet0961.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et0961.png</a><br>
<br>
Pay attention how fast he's traveling around the world.<br>
<br>
Week before he's in Turkey: <br>
<a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet0971.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et0971.png</a> <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet0981.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et0981.png</a> <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet1041.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et1041.png</a> - With Luke P. Brown in Instanbul. <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet1061.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et1061.png</a> Scott comments that Istanbul is so last week ( meaning he's with them but he was THERE a little bit before them? ) Then Jimmy comments that he will be catching up to Patmos and Mykonos, two Greek Islands with distance of 100 km between them ...<br>
<br>
And they're taking picture in Turkey, Alefantis says "selfie with Scott and Luke" but there's only woman and little girl on that picture: <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet1091.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et1091.png</a><br>
<br>
Here's: <a href="https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzaslut.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jimmycomet1101.png" class="postlink">https://boycottvoodoodoughnutandpizzasl ... et1101.png</a> The Hamptons<br>
<br>
Considering such fast traveling and the very eerie picture from Turkey I feel that the whole operation was about facilitating human trafficking or supplying some old pedo fags on some islands. Alefantis is not interested in his pizzeria at all, it's running good without him.<br>
<br>
The girl on that picture could be nabiya: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nabiya/" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/nabiya/</a> There's no activity on her IG in that period of time, also she's followed by ( LISTEN GOOD NOW ): Barack Obama on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/nabiya/followers" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/nabiya/followers</a> and Joseph Wills - guy who joked about corrosion from urination under mural of children on Justin Barrows channel - <a href="https://archive.fo/nrqZJ" class="postlink">https://archive.fo/nrqZJ</a> ( nabiya like is also there ), she's also following and is followed by Nilaylawson who said "just rinse it off when you're done" under infamous picture of killroom: <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/86mWlT.png" class="postlink">http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-conte ... 86mWlT.png</a> Also Nabiya (Juliane E. Min ) was the only user to like Justin Barrows picture of Lolita book: <a href="https://archive.fo/Qkvpg" class="postlink">https://archive.fo/Qkvpg</a><br>
<br>
Obama following her on Twitter: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mbkGlxZ.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/mbkGlxZ.png</a> Nilaylawson following her on Twitter: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TzeFAsL.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/TzeFAsL.png</a>  JoeWills following her on Twitter: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DBouxML.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/DBouxML.png</a> Nabiya following Nilaylawson: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ITr4zzP.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/ITr4zzP.png</a><br>

That's her page: <a href="http://www.julianemin.com/about" class="postlink">http://www.julianemin.com/about</a> Nabiya. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/I7n7NdlYb5/" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/I7n7NdlYb5/</a><br>
<br>
<a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vcywS7X.png" class="postlink">http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-conte ... cywS7X.png</a> Could she be the girl on that picture? Exact place where the picture was taken: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@41.0137926,28.9842326,3a,61.2y,288.98h,79.26t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipOfKx2WKZsrukFzChRaBFRtYP0mOEByHTKqYo7s!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOfKx2WKZsrukFzChRaBFRtYP0mOEByHTKqYo7s%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0.78234684-ya325.24048-ro4.811517-fo100!7i5376!8i2688" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/maps/@41.0137926 ... 376!8i2688</a><br>

<br>
Topkap Saray. Facilitating human trafficking, probably a reason why they're traveling so fast?<br>
<br>
Even if that's not her then looking by her IG and Twitter connections then the girl could be one of her friends: <a href="https://twitter.com/nabiya/followers" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/nabiya/followers</a> She has many Asian people there including Hindu ones and the girl on the picture has distinctive Hindu look.</div></blockquote>

I've also made fresh edits because the thread was not picked up by search voat as updated (I've updated it back then) and it got bad chronology of James travel.<br>
<br>
Could this be : <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vcywS7X.png" class="postlink">http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-conte ... cywS7X.png</a><br>

Not conclusive, but I think we need to be definitely interested who that woman on James picture is and separate from that - should be our interest in learning the meaning of the pattern we found around jimmycomet's circle, interestingly, people like Chris Moukarbel or Juliane E. Min ... prove there's some pattern connecting very very bizarre accounts showing bigger and more solid network.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Her Father is the 9th Duke of Wellington, she is a descendant of Queen Victoria and she has access to a family estate worth tens of millions of pounds.<br>
<br>
Lady Charlotte, however, married <span style="color:#FF0040">Alejandro Santo Domingo</span>, a 40-year-old Colombian-American businessman with a degree from Harvard and shares in one of the world’s largest breweries, in a ceremony in Spain last year.<br>
<br>
The couple, who debuted at number 29, are described as having accumulated their estimated fortune of £3,682million through “inheritance, brewing and investment”.<br>
<br>
Mr Santo Domingo is at the helm of his family’s conglomerate, the Santo Domingo Group. He is also the managing director of a New York-based investment advisory firm and was elected to the Board of Trustees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2009.<br>
<br>
He was linked to heiress Amanda Hearst and model Eugenia Silva before meeting Lady Charlotte, whose ancestor the 1st Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. The Oxford graduate, who studied archaeology and anthropology, now works with photographer Mario</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Alejandro Santo Domingo (born 13 February 1977) is a Colombian-American billionaire financier and philanthropist. As of March 2022, his estimated net worth was US$2.5 billion<br>
<br>
He is the son of Colombian billionaire Julio Mario Santo Domingo and his second wife, Colombian socialite Beatrice Dávila. He is the brother of Andres Santo Domingo Dávila and half-brother of Julio Mario Santo Domingo Braga (1958 – March 2009), who was the only child of Julio Mario Santo Domingo and his first wife, Brazilian socialite Edyala Braga.<br>
<br>
His work centers on managing his family's conglomerate, the Santo Domingo Group. He is the chairman of Grupo Empresarial Bavaria S.A., a privately owned subsidiary of SABMiller, of which he is vice-chairman for Latin America. His partner is his maternal cousin, Carlos Alejandro Pérez Dávila, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker who helps him manage the family portfolio.[3] Along with said cousin, he is also the managing director of the New York-based Quadrant Capital Advisors, Inc.[2] In 2009, Santo Domingo was elected to the Board of Trustees on the Metropolitan Museum of Art<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>DKMS (German "Deutsche KnochenMarkSpenderdatei" or "German Bone Marrow Donor File") is an international nonprofit bone marrow donor center based in Tübingen, Germany, with entities in the US, UK, Chile, Poland, India and South Africa. DKMS works in the areas of blood cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and raises awareness of the need for donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which people with blood cancers need for treatment as well as helping people sign up to their national bone marrow registries<br>
<br>
DKMS was founded in Germany in 1991 by billionaire Peter Harf, an executive with Coty, Inc., and university professor Gerhard Ehninger [de], the hematologist who treated his first wife Mechtild Harf<br>
<br>
Harf founded DKMS to raise awareness of the need for donors in Germany and to help people to register with the German national bone marrow registry. He included the whole family, including their 14-year-old daughter Katharina, in the effort.<br>
<br>
Katharina eventually moved to the United States to Harvard, worked for <span style="color:#FF0040">Louis Vuitton</span> in New York City for a time, then started an MBA at Columbia University; she dropped out and instead founded the US affiliate of DKMS with her father in 2004.[1] The US affiliate also works to raise awareness of the need for donors, helps people register with the National Marrow Donor Program, and if needed will help pay for any health tests, medication and travel costs<br>
<br>
In the US and UK, DKMS hold their annual 'Big Love' gala event to fundraise which is often attended by high-profile celebrities. Their most recent event was held at the Camden Roundhouse in November 2018, with attendees including Georgia May Jagger, Jamie Redknapp, Henry Holland and their global ambassador, model <span style="color:#FF0040">Eva Herzigova</span><br>
