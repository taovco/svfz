U.S. Intelligence Coverup? Newly Declassified FBI File on Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain Compounds Evidence Implicating his Wife’s Role in his Murder<br>
<br>
<br>
 so, —Why?<br>
<br>
The grisly death of mega rock star Kurt Cobain in 1994  was officially ruled a suicide by the Seattle police, but evidence quickly came to light that Cobain had actually been murdered. However, despite serious holes in the official narrative about Cobain’s death, the verdict of suicide has held firm for 27 years.<br>
<br>
On May 7, the FBI quietly and declassified 10 pages of  documents relating to Cobain’s death, which alongside a mass of accumulated evidence suggest that the agency had purposely avoided looking into the radical activist musician’s death. One potential explanation for this failure could be due to the CIA’s involvement in the murder.<br>
<br>
The latter seems plausible given the connections to the CIA of Courtney Love, Cobain’s former wife, who is the top suspect in the murder. Love happened to be a drug distributor during the same time that the CIA was heavily involved in trafficking opium and using drugs as political weapons. The latter links call for deeper scrutiny.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Professor Al McCoy, Peter Dale Scott and numerous other authors have documented how the U.S. launched the second longest war in U.S. history at least partly for control of the Golden Triangle of poppy fields around Vietnam in the 1960s.<br>
<br>
The Golden Crescent for poppy fields also appeared as at least one of the reasons for U.S. involvement in Afgh. This turned into the ongoing war launched in 2002 and remains the longest war in U.S. history.<br>
<br>
In 1953, the CIA initiated Project MK-Ultra, where many drugs, including opiates and LSD, were used for “unconventional warfare.” In 1971, The Washington Post revealed how the CIA infiltrated 17 Washington-area activist groups and gave out LSD, apparently to disrupt their minds and their work.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Senate’s Church Committee investigation of MK-Ultra, along with later revelations, detailed how U.S. intelligence particularly focused on using drugs and female assets against activist musicians.<br>
<br>
Many sources detail how Courtney Love started using hard drugs as a young teenager and prostituted herself in various parts of the world.<br>
Love biographer Melissa Rossi said she obtained a letter from a former boyfriend in which Love admitted prostituting in Taiwan as a teenager. Even an authorized biography by Poppy Z. Brite includes statements that Love worked as a stripper for an organized crime family in Japan as part of what she called “the white slave trade.”<br>

 slave trade.”<br>
Courtney Love with her father Hank Harrison. <br>
<br>
Courtney Love’s father, Hank Harrison, ex-manager of the Grateful Dead, stated that he introduced Love to a man in Dublin named Steve O’Leary, who had sex with her when she was 17 years old.<br>
<br>
O’Leary took Love to England, where she brought a thousand hits of LSD to punk and new wave music scenes, distributing the acid to musicians. She would also sleep with many of these musicians and disrupt bands.<br>
<br>
She repeated this behavior in many American music scenes, handing out many kinds of drugs like candy. Harrison said that O’Leary, when he was on his deathbed, sent him a letter stating that he had been working for the CIA at the time.<br>
Cobain’s Radical Left Politics<br>
Paperback Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana Book[Source: thriftbooks.com]<br>
<br>
One of the reasons the FBI may have had for either participating in and/or covering up Kurt Cobain’s murder relates to their history of targeting anti-war, pro-civil rights leftists. When activists broke into an FBI office in 1971, they revealed its Counter-Intelligence Program (Cointelpro), which started in the 1950s and targeted anti-war and civil rights activists.<br>
<br>
Many of Cobain’s statements and actions reflected his radical left political ideology. One example comes from the first book on Nirvana, Come as You Are.<br>
<br>
Cobain told author Michael Azerrad that he originally wanted to put “anarchistic, revolutionary essays and diagrams about how to make your own bomb” on the inside of Nirvana’s hugely popular album Nevermind. Cobain added that he “just thought we better hold off on that … we’d be more effective if we gained popularity first.”<br>
Kurt Cobain subscribed to radical left-wing political views. <br>
<br>
<br>
Police Detective-Turned P.I. First Exposed Murder Evidence<br>
The FBI file consisted of three letters replying to correspondence asking that they conduct an investigation into evidence that someone murdered Cobain. The file also includes a television transcript of an Unsolved Mysteries episode from 1997.<br>
<br>
That episode features private investigator Tom Grant, who had previously worked as a detective for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.<br>
<br>
Cobain’s wife, Courtney Love, had hired Grant “to find” her husband on April 3, 1994. An electrician reported finding Cobain dead in a room above the garage in their Seattle home five days later, on April 8.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After several more months of investigation, Grant reported that Courtney Love may have been involved in the murder and actually knew her husband’s whereabouts when she hired him.<br>
<br>
The Unsolved Mysteries episode transcript featured Tom Grant’s evidence supporting that the Seattle Police Department’s “investigation should be reopened.”<br>
<br>
Grant has accumulated a huge trove of evidence. A summary of his evidence includes recorded conversations with Cobain and Love’s lawyer, Rosemary Carroll, wherein she states that she did not believe Cobain wrote the suicide note.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Unsolved Mysteries television show hired two national handwriting experts who confirmed that the bottom part of the note was not Cobain’s handwriting. Additionally, Grant has a recording of Rosemary Carroll stating that Cobain was divorcing Love at the time of his death.<br>

<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Grant also showed evidence that someone tried to use Cobain’s credit card after his death.<br>
<br>
Grant also obtained a leaked coroner’s report noting that Cobain had three times the dose of heroin that would have immediately incapacitated and killed even a hardcore addict. According to the report, there was also Diazepam in Cobain’s system.<br>
<br>
<br>
Heroin kit found in Cobain’s home.<br>
<br>
While some had claimed Cobain was using heroin regularly at the time, that was countered by blood tests from his hospitalization in Rome a month before his death.<br>
<br>
Courtney Love had obtained Rohypnol (“roofies”) in England, where they were legal for sleep, and brought their daughter Frances to see Cobain while he was on tour in Rome.<br>
<br>
Love was an obvious suspect in Cobain’s near-fatal overdose on that same Rohypnol, which temporarily put him in a coma and conveniently erased his memory of what happened. Max Wallace reported talking to the Roman hospital’s Dr. Galetta, who stated that it was not a suicide attempt.<br>
Mentors Lead Singer Claims Love Asked Him, and Then Allan Wrench, to Kill Cobain<br>
<br>
Alongside P.I. Tom Grant’s murder claim, Eldon “El Duce” Hoke, lead singer of The Mentors, stated on film that Courtney Love offered him $50,000 to shoot Cobain in the head with a shotgun. She made the offer at Hoke’s job site, The Rock Shop, a record store in Hollywood, California, at the end of 1993. Hoke called the Los Angeles and Seattle police departments about this, but nothing came of it.<br>
Eldon Wayne “El Duce” Hoke<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1996, NBC’s Hard Copy hired one of the country’s top polygraph examiners, Dr. Edward Gelb, who conducted a<br>
 “lie detector” test, which Hoke passed with only .01% of deception.<br>
<br>
In 1997, Hoke re-stated this allegation about Courtney Love, first to a journalist who taped their conversation, and then to filmmaker Nick Broomfield, who included Hoke making the assertion in his film Kurt and Courtney.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the film, Hoke added that he wasn’t available to follow through with the offer, but he knew who did, “Allan …” and then he cut himself off, saying ironically, “I’ll let the FBI catch him.”<br>
<br>
Eldon Hoke was found dead near some train tracks several days after that interview.<br>
“A Violation of Federal Law Within Our Investigative Jurisdiction” Needed.<br>
<br>
several of the letters in Cobain’s FBI file from 20002/007 ask for a homicide investigation, to which the FBI gave the exact same response: “most homicide investigations fall within the jurisdiction of state and local authorities. In order for the FBI to initiate an investigation of any complaint we receive, specific facts must be present to indicate that a violation of federal law within our investigative jurisdiction has occurred.”<br>
<br>
The U.S. Attorney’s Bulletin states: “The intent element of § 1958 relates to murder; it does not relate to interstate activity. The interstate travel merely triggers federal jurisdiction. A defendant need not intend to travel across state lines to commit murder-for-hire; instead, a defendant need only intend to commit a murder-for-hire and, in doing so, travel across state lines” Bertoldo v. United States, 145 F. Supp. 2d 111, 115 (D. Mass. 2001).[26]<br>
<br>
One of the letters from 2003 mentions the book Who Killed Kurt Cobain? published in 1998 by Max Wallace and Ian Halperin, as well as Broomfield’s film Kurt and Courtney.<br>
<br>
As previously stated, the film presents Eldon Hoke stating that Courtney Love traveled from Seattle, Washington, to Los Angeles, California, conspiring to have Cobain murdered. Hoke stated it on film.<br>
<br>
Wallace and Halperin’s next book on Cobain, Love and Death (2005), discusses how Hoke stated that fellow musician friend Allan Wrench took Love’s offer and killed Cobain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The authors heard this from journalist Brent Alden, who used a tape recorder during his interview of Hoke.<br>
<br>
The Mentors’ lead singer nervously stated that Courtney Love came looking for him at The Rock Shop several weeks after offering him the money. Love reportedly became angry when The Rock Shop owner said Hoke was on tour with his band.<br>
<br>
Hoke then heard that his friend Allen Wrench, another LA singer of the band “Kill Allen Wrench,” took Love’s offer to kill Cobain. When Hoke was found dead, the last person seen with him the night of his death was Allen Wrench.<br>

Police Cover-up<br>
<br>
Tom Grant further found evidence of a Seattle police cover-up, which can happen when police intelligence get word from higher up the U.S. intelligence hierarchy. He stated that police didn’t check for fingerprints on the shotgun found with Kurt Cobain until a month after his body was found. Police claimed they found no legible prints.<br>
<br>
Police also refused to develop the photos from the scene of death for twenty years, and a police officer said his supervisor stated they were not to investigate Cobain’s death as a homicide.<br>
<br>
Police only released photos of the shotgun used to kill Kurt Cobain in 2016, over 20 years after his death. <br>

<br>
After analyzing all the evidence around Kurt Cobain’s death, Cyril Wecht, MD, a former President of the American Academy of Forensic Science, told CBS Channel 2 News in Pittsburgh that he thought Cobain’s death was “a homicide” and “a staged suicide.”<br>
<br>
Wecht first described how there was enough heroin in Cobain to kill five people. Police claim Cobain then had the time to put his syringe and other paraphernalia away neatly in a box before picking up the shotgun, which Wecht said was “highly unlikely,” since such a large dose of heroin incapacitates people in seconds.<br>
<br>
Another cover-up occurred after Detective Antonio Terry reportedly went against his superior’s orders to not investigate Cobain’s death as anything but a suicide, and investigated the source of the heroin in Cobain’s body. Someone then murdered Detective Terry, making him the first active duty Seattle police officer to die in nine years.<br>

<br>
More links between Courtney Love and U.S. intelligence came up three to four decades later.<br>
<br>
Notorious pedophile and sex trafficker to the rich and famous, Jeffrey Epstein, had a house manager, Alfredo Rodriguez, who stole his “black book” from his apartment.<br>
<br>
For a law firm representing victims, Rodriguez circled key people as potential “material witnesses” to crimes against underage girls. Courtney Love was one of the only women among 46 other names circled, out of hundreds of names in the book.<br>
<br>
Courtney Love appeared in Jeffrey Epstein’s guest book. <br>
<br>
Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said he made a notoriously lenient deal with Jeffrey Epstein in 2007 on sex trafficking charges. “I was told Epstein belonged to intelligence and to leave it alone,” he told his interviewers in the President Trump transition team, who allowed him to become Labor Secretary.[34]<br>
<br>
Ari Ben-Menashe, formerly employed by Israel’s Military Intelligence Directorate, stated Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell worked for Israeli intelligence in a blackmailing operation.<br>
<br>
This operation included MK-Ultra drugs—illegal and psychiatric—for both blackmail and exploitation of the girls.<br>
<br>
By many accounts, Love influenced Cobain into daily heroin use for the first time and Cobain inadvertently helped popularize the drug for at least several years.<br>
<br>
Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain when they were dating in 1991. <br>
<br>
Cobain had always said he had a horribly painful stomach problem that heroin helped quell, but once he found a medical cure in 1993, he stopped using heroin, as verified by the Roman hospital’s blood test a month before <br>
his death.<br>
<br>
Kurt Cobain<br>
Cobain stopped using heroin in the year before his death, casting further doubt that he died from an overdose. <br>
<br>
A newly sober Cobain threatened to promote sobriety and his leftist activism.<br>
<br>
All in all, there is evidence to indicate that U.S. intelligence may have played a part in Kurt Cobain’s murder. <br>
At the very least, a new investigation is warranted.<br>
