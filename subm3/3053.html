<br>
<br>
<br>
Elon Musk is a total fraud<br>
<br>
Finally revealed : Elon Musk a fraud.<br>
<br>
Enraged that a British cave diver called his idea to rescue a soccer team for what it was — “a p.r. Stunt  .....” — Musk called him  a “pedo.”on twitter. Just like that, Tesla’s market value plummeted by $2 billion. Musk has been in business since 2002. His stated goal is of transforming humanity through his products: his electric cars, space travel, and an underground high-speed Hyperloop system. He has yet to succeed at anything but spins every failure into proof of imminent success. His only accomplishment has been this decades-long mind trick. Tesla is best known for blowing deadlines and falling short on production.<br>
<br>
Tesla has been suffering an epic talent drain, as well.  Two top execs — one the liaison with the Nat’l Transportation Safety Board — walked out the door. A Tesla driver was killed while test-driving an auto-piloted Model X, the impact decimating half the car. Then in May, the NTSB announced an investigation after two teenagers were killed in a Tesla Model S after its battery caught fire following a crash. A similar accident claimed a driver two months prior, with firefighters reporting that the Tesla battery kept reigniting days after the smash. California’s Div of Occupational Safety and Health opened its third investigation into workplace safety at Tesla Inc. after employee complaints. Two investigations have been ongoing since April, yet Musk took to Twitter to boast that Tesla was now building its cars in a tent .<br>
<br>
This is a genius?<br>
<br>
Tesla was founded in 2003, but the world’s largest automakers quickly surpassed Musk’s vision for electric vehicles. Tesla will never catch up. Shareholders are finally catching on.<br>
<br>
The government, reportedly gifts Musk’s companies with an estimated $4.9 billion in subsidies. Gov subsidies are not to "help" companies grow, but to make them govt's slave. Everything that comes from Musk is guaranteed to have backdoors and other hidden surprises. Musk is most likely a frontman, a figurehead sponsored by In-Q-Tel, which is a CIA subdivision, which is tasked with funding companies in order to make them part of the government, so they can put their backdoors and other surprises. <br>
<br>
He is just like Jeff Bezos, Mark ZuckerBerg, Tom Hanks, Jack Dorsey and Bill Gates. They all have specific high-profile public images in their respective fields, however they are also active behind the scenes, all connected through the same entity of common intel agency. Intelligence agencies are especially heavily interested and invested in all tech sectors, especially space and remote-controlled cars, so just like they have journalists as assets that work for big newspapers to spin specific stories that the CIA wants, they have tech CEOs, developers etc. that do CIA's bidding. When one of them shows a higher potential, then that person gets into smaller, close-circle of powerful people. Elon Musk is one of them.<br>
<br>
Where else does Elon get his money ?<br>
Penn State, Cornell university, US Gov                         Hmm<br>
<br>
SpaceX — which Musk touts as replacing NASA and colonizing Mars — has been a literal failure to launch. So many <br>
of its rockets have burned up .<br>
<br>
“Is it possible to build a Hyperloop train into a 200-mile underground tunnel on a reasonable timeline that moves people in 29 minutes [from DC to New York] and isn’t prohibitively expensive? Probably not.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Elon Musk's family once owned a share in an emerald mine in Zambia yet Elon says he grew up poor. Father Errol <br>
said that emeralds helped to fund the family's lavish lifestyle of yachts, skiing holidays, and expensive computers. A teenage Musk once sold his father's emeralds to Tiffany &amp; Co. while his dad was sleeping.<br>
<br>
Musk attended Waterkloof House Prep School and Bryanston High School, before graduating from Pretoria Boys HS.<br>
in South Africa. Sexual assault charges filed against coach. <br>
<br>
Also, read about Musk's grandfather: <a href="https://www.technocracy.news/shock-elon-musks-grandfather-was-head-of-canadas-technocracy-movement/" class="postlink">https://www.technocracy.news/shock-elon ... -movement/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Elon Musk explains the one thing that went wrong with SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Flight.<br>
Elon Musk, works in 5-minute slots.<br>
Elon Musk just told his 'biggest lie' about Tesla yet. <br>
Elon was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he has secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his <br>
chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage.<br>
Musk has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for <br>
his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, check Musk's ties with Michael Griffin, (head of NASA 2005-2009). Griffin was also working for In-Q-Tel, a CIA subdivision.<br>
