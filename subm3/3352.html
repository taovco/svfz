<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paul Edward Theroux (born April 10, 1941) is an American novelist and travel writer who has written numerous books, including the travelogue, The Great Railway Bazaar (1975)... He is the father of British authors and documentary filmmakers Marcel and Louis Theroux, the brother of authors Alexander Theroux and Peter Theroux, and uncle of the American actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux.<br>
<br>
...His brothers are Eugene, Alexander, Joseph and Peter..<br>
<br>
..After he finished his university education, Theroux joined the Peace Corps in 1963 as a teacher in Malawi.[7][8] A new program, the Peace Corps had sent its first volunteers overseas in 1961. Theroux helped a political opponent of Prime Minister Hastings Banda escape to Uganda. For this, Theroux was expelled from Malawi and thrown out of the Peace Corps. He was declared persona non grata by Banda in Malawi for sympathizing with Yatuta Chisiza.[9] As a consequence, his later novel Jungle Lovers, which concerns an attempted coup in the country, was banned in Malawi for many years.<br>
<br>
He moved to Uganda in 1965 to teach English[10] at Makerere University, where he also wrote for the magazine Transition. While at Makerere, Theroux began his friendship with Rajat Neogy, founder of Transition Magazine, and novelist V.S. Naipaul, then a visiting scholar at the university.[11][12][13] During his time in Uganda, an angry mob at a demonstration threatened to overturn the car in which his pregnant wife was riding, and Theroux decided to leave Africa...<br>
<br>
..When Theroux was in Uganda, his friends found him a teaching position at Makerere University in Kampala. There he met Anne Castle, a British graduate student teaching at an upcountry girls' secondary school in Kenya, via Voluntary Service Overseas.[19][20][2] They married in 1967. After leaving Asia and Dorset, they moved to South London, England in 1971,.. They had two sons: Marcel and Louis, both of whom are writers and documentarians. Theroux and Castle divorced in 1993.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Theroux married a second time to Sheila Donnelly, on November 18, 1995. His wife runs a luxury travel/hotel PR agency.</span>[21] They reside in Hawaii and Cape Cod, Massachusetts</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This week, the removals men have been at magnificent Port Eliot House in Cornwall to move out Cathy Wilson — the magazine journalist who became a countess when she wed the Earl of St Germans in 2005. That’s because her husband, Peregrine, died last year at the age of 75, and she has to make way for his grandson, Albert, who became the 11th Earl of St Germans at the tender age of 11...<br>
<br>
Albert’s mother, Bianca, an ex-model and the former fiancee of Earl Spencer, is worried that, among the furniture and other possessions being taken away in a fleet of removals vehicles, are family heirlooms that should be kept at Port Eliot for Albert...<br>
<br>
Lady St Germans’ departure brings to an end an awkward situation in which she has been sharing the 123-room house, which has 85 chimneys and a roof covering half an acre, with Albert, Bianca and her 14-year-old twins, Ruby and Violet, for the past few months. Cathy, 47, is understood to be moving to a house 30 miles away in Fowey that is also owned by the estate. ..<br>
<br>
The 6,000-acre estate near Saltash is famous for the bohemian <span style="color:#FF0040">Port Eliot arts festival</span> that is held there each summer.<br>
<br>
It has been inherited by Albert, who turned 13 this month, because his party-loving father, Lord [Jago] Eliot, who first set up the festival, was found dead in the bath at the age of 40 in 2006 after suffering an epileptic fit.<br>
<br>
..It is believed that Bianca will keep the festival going despite the departure of Cathy, who became heavily involved in its organisation.<br>
<br>
Three years ago, I disclosed that Albert’s grandfather planned to sell the estate to <span style="color:#FF0040">his friend Prince Charles</span>, who wanted to convert the house into an arts centre. However, the heir to the throne pulled out of the deal in 2015 after Cathy boasted about it on the festival’s website.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Elephant Fayre began in 1981as a small scale Fayre which featured a mix of music, theatre and visual arts . .. Hard drug use and a "brew crew " element had began to destroy the community that had freely moved from festival to festival during the Stonehenge years and the feeling within the "Peace Convoy " was no longer what it had been in those days- in fact many of the original members of the original Peace Convoy which travelled to Greenham Common in 1982 had left by 1986....<br>

Rick Worthy , who was one of the driving forces in organising the festival from 81 to 86 , has this to say about the Convoy<br>
<br>
"The ONLY reason the festival folded was the Peace Convoy !<br>
A very misnamed bunch of thugs. They caused so much trouble in this village and those nearby too.

After spending some time in St Ives, Cornwall, hanging out with beatniks, he moved to London in the mid-60s and set up what the writer Richard Neville called an "ultra-hippy cult" known as the Hyde Park Diggers. By the spring of 1968, the Diggers had more than 200 members, who played a prominent role in the squatting movement and, in September 1969, participated in the six-day occupation by the London Street Commune of 144 Piccadilly, a neglected 100-room mansion.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Despite the adulation and enthusiasm of the growing band of Beatles fans in India, their trip to Rishikesh was not without its controversies. There were many people in the country who were openly hostile to both Maharishi [Mahesh Yogi] and the arrival of the rock band and other celebrities from the West in his ashram. In the Lok Sabha, the elected Lower House of the Indian Parliament, the Opposition went up in arms alleging that the yogi was in cahoots with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and that many of his guests from abroad were actually foreign spies...<br>
<br>
Ironically, as wire services across the world buzzed with the news of the Beatles and Mia Farrow in the Maharishi’s ashram, it provoked an angry outburst from the Los Angeles-based guru Swami <span style="color:#FF0040">Vishnudevananda Saraswati</span> who had been the first Indian holy man to approach the Fab Four while they were shooting their film Help! in the Bahamas three years ago. ..

<br>
In 2007, his long-serving assistant, Julie Salter, reported sexual abuse against her by the guru; she published details of her experiences in 2019, leading at least 14 other women to report their experiences of similar abuse by Vishnudevananda... Salter and 14 other women described their experiences, including alleged rape, to the BBC journalist and Sivananda yoga teacher Ishleen Kaur. Salter stated that when she told Vishnudevananda she did not understand his instruction to lie down next to him, he replied "Tantra yoga", implying some form of spiritual sexual activity...<br>

What is less known is that Peter Sellers in his private life was a particularly nasty, abusive piece of work:<br>

Blouin later married John MacBain and the couple acquired Auto Hebdo, a classified car trading magazine, in 1987. The business grew into Trader Classified Media.

Remembering David Bowie at St Germans <a href="https://www.newartexaminer.net/remembering-david-bowie-at-st-germans/" class="postlink">https://www.newartexaminer.net/remember ... t-germans/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yesterday, on the train from Penzance to Paddington, as I passed the tiny station of St Germans, I looked back, and high over the the estuary bathed in the searing dawn light, was a perfect rainbow stretching over the rolling green lawns of Port Eliot, ancestral home of the Earls of St Germans. Port Eliot itself<br>
is not visible from the train, but so very visible in my mind’s eye and my memories. It was here I introduced Peregrine St Germans, the owner of Port Eliot, to David Bowie, in 1981. It was on this lawn I photographed us all smiling and laughing in anticipation of a relaxed country weekend. David had a great love of Cornwall, its myths and its legends, so when I heard he was planning to take his son Joe (as he was then called) on a sojourn to the south-west, and knowing that my friend, Peregrine, was keen to have him play at his festival, the Elephant Fayre, I suggested a long weekend at an historic country house would give them the opportunity to discuss the possibility, plus a chance for me to catch up with my dear friend, Corinne Schwab, (known to friends as Coco), who was David’s longtime PA, right hand, and trusted companion.<br>
<br>
I had met David through my friendship with Coco in the late 1970’s, and had shared many good times with them both.I’d travelled with them on a chartered boat up the Italian coast, watched David and his band perform at several concerts from the stage side wings, visited some of his film sets, hung out in homes in New York and Switzerland, and mine in Warwickshire, play Grandmother’s Footsteps and Scrabble, and even be styled in London by David for my first model shoot with a then unknown photographer called Mario Testino. (David had seen my portfolio of photos and pronounced them all ‘rubbish’. “Rinthy”, he said (his pet nickname for me), “there’s this young Peruvian guy who’s just done some pictures for me – I think he’s really good – will you let me arrange a shoot for you?”. One of the attributes that David had, and I have not heard enough about in all the tributes and obituaries that poured in last January when the world woke up to the news of his tragic and untimely death, was that David was SO kind. He did not have to arrange anything for me, I was not his girlfriend, nor his protege, just a friend of his own best friend, Coco, and that was enough for him. He was also very funny, with a wicked sense of humour.<br>
<br>
Once on the set of ‘The Hunger’ a very old man approached me and said he was terribly sorry to bother me, but he was David’s father and as David couldn’t be on the set that day, he had been asked to look after me. It was only because everyone around us was sniggering, that I realized it was in fact David in full ageing Methuselah make-up. Later, when I left the modelling and acting world to be an unknown journalist in Los Angeles, he allowed me to do an interview with him in a music magazine. That interview put me on the journalistic map in America, and (in pre-internet days!) brought more commissions and just enough money to put the down payment on an apartment. He was always doing kind acts for people he liked, and the Testino shoot was just one. To my eternal regret, (and Mario’s embarrassment) the negatives were lost at the lab, so David’s hand at tweaking my Anthony Price dress, and Coco’s assurances that my lipstick was not smudged, were lost forever, however the memory remains, and surely that is what matters in the end.<br>
<br>
So we gathered at Port Eliot, David, Coco, myself,Joe (then about 10, and later to become the respected film maker Duncan Jones), and Marion, Joe’s nanny and family friend. The weekend did not start auspiciously. Peregrine had some fixed views on children eating with grown ups and assumed that the four of us would sit down for dinner on Friday night (under the Rembrandt and drinking Leoville Barton) and Marion and Joe would “eat in the nursery”. When I found out – minutes before their arrival – I was horrified. “David is here on a family holiday – he’s a post divorce dad, and the whole point is that he sees Joe as much as possible. Marion is an integral part of the family. There is no way that David will want to eat in separate rooms”. Peregrine was adamant and put on his best ‘I am the 10th Earl of St Germans – this is my house so what I say goes’ expression. “I have lunch at one and dinner at eight, and a no-children under 15 rule at each”. I threatened to leave and take my friends with me to a nearby Cornwallian hotel, and grudgingly, Peregrine agreed, but the stage was definitely not set for the two men to bond. For all Peregrine’s great charm and (much publicized) “ eccentric hippie lifestyle” , he was in fact deeply old-fashioned in some ways, and as the weekend progressed, despite some interesting trips like a visit to a local arts and crafts house, David never did play the Elephant Fayre. “Rinthy” said David conspiratorially to me, as Perry showed him the Robert Lenkowitz mural on his drawing room wall, and the maze with the bulls head buried at it’s centre,<span style="color:#FF0040"> “I discovered the word ‘Lucifer” scrawled in red on a mirror this morning. This place is too weird, even for me!” T</span>o be fair this probably had nothing to do with Peregrine, as the mirror was in the rooms of the playwright <span style="color:#FF0040">Heathcote Williams</span>, who at that time was lodging in a wing of the house…<br>
<br>
So, as my London bound train glides over Brunel’s aqueduct in 2017, I look back to Port Eliot’s lawn in 1981 and I remember that I took a photograph of us all that weekend. I took it with the camera on a tripod, then whipped round to sit on the grass. There’s David with Coco behind him, me shading my eyes from the sun, and Peregrine with his son Jago. I suppose it was an original “Ussie”, David died a year ago in the week of his birthday, just before releasing his final album, Lazarus, and Peregrine died in August, just before his beloved Port Eliot Festival opened. Jago too had sadly died, a few years ago, much too young. As the train pulls in to Plymouth, the rainbow recedes, and a whole bunch of cheerful yet rowdy football fans board, (deeply unconcerned with anything other than the beautiful game) my moment of reverie has passed. Putting on my headphones, I bed down in my seat and listen to Lazarus, David’s last album, and the title song with the extraordinarily prescient lines “Look up here, I’m in heaven, I’ve got scars that can’t be seen, I’ve got drama can’t be stolen. everybody knows me now”, which, of course, is true. They know the very public David, the multi-talented musician, singer, song writer, actor, alchemist etc. His death caused a huge outpouring of tributes from fans. Lazarus, the play, opened in New York and London, and various pieces of his art collection were sold at Sotheby’s, raising millions, and no doubt the spotlight and tributes will roll in again on the anniversary of his death. His extraordinary legacy will live forever, but on the morning he died, so elegantly and quietly with not even some of his closest friends knowing (how like David) when I heard the news on the radio like everyone else, apart from the shaft of pure sadness that shot through me like a spear at the loss of someone I had personally known, , I thought (rather selfishly on reflection) “no one will ever call me ‘Rinthy’ again”…..<br>

Sponsored by the Fish Society. The Coach and Horses. Greek st. Soho. London. 11 February 2014.<br>
<br>
His father was Welsh judge Sir William Mars-Jones who was involved in a number of high profile trials <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jan/12/guardianobituaries" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/j ... obituaries</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..He prosecuted in the <span style="color:#FF0040">Moors Murders trial in 1965</span>, and that year was appointed to conduct an official inquiry into allegations of misbehaviour at several London police stations. The Mars-Jones Report identified the lack of accountability which contributed to the corruption which engulfed Scotland Yard later. It may also have given him his deep detestation for this kind of corruption, which he demonstrated in 1975 by jailing eight policemen for a total of 77 years for taking bribes from Soho pornographers: they had "turned the Obscene Publications Squad into a gigantic protection racket".<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">He was appointed a High Court judge in 1969. </span>He may have been selected to preside over the ABC trial because of his reputation for complete mastery of the jury ("they always do exactly what he wants" was the groan in the robing room). The prosecution was the brain-child of M15, which wanted to jail the scientific journalist Duncan Campbell (C), who kept breaching D-notices. Campbell and Time Out reporter Crispin Aubrey (A) were arrested for talking to an ex-soldier John Berry (B) about his service many years before in a GCHQ signals regiment in Cyprus. MI5 prevailed on a weak Labour Attorney-General to authorise a prosecution under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act, in breach of previous undertakings that this charge would never be used against journalists.<br>
<br>
The proceedings were a turning-point for official secrecy in Britain. The government was forced to admit to the existence of GCHQ, and then (as the result of a Mars-Jones ruling) to the intercept role of its signals units in Cyprus. Its law officers were obliged to own up to their practice of vetting jurors in security-sensitive cases, and lost a constitutional battle with the media over the right to report the real identity of the Crown's chief witness when the officer was named in Parliament. Such was the controversy stirred by the ABC support campaign, that conviction of the defendants on the Section 1 charge became a matter of political importance, both for the government and the security services.<br>
<br>
When the State invokes national security, the independence of the judiciary is the citizen's vital protection. On October 24, 1978, towards the end of the prosecution evidence, Mr Justice Mars-Jones announced he was "extremely unhappy" about this "oppressive prosecution". Section 1 was designed for use against spies: why was it being used against freedom of speech? The prosecutor said the proceedings had been authorised by the Attorney General. "If the Attorney-General can authorise the prosecution, then he can unauthorise it," snapped Mars-Jones. Next morning Sam Silkin did just that, and Section 1 has never again been used against journalists or whistleblowers.<br>
<br>
Mars-Jones's conduct of the trial was an important assertion of the judicial role as a check on state power and has often been cited as an example of how judges can be trusted, when press and Parliament fail, to protect fundamental liberties. It assisted the argument for a Bill of Rights which finally succeeded with the incorporation last year of the European Convention...</div></blockquote>

1969 .. such an interesting year.. Woodstock fiasco, Stonewall raid in NY and the start of the LGBTQ movement.. drawing parallels between New York and London during that time is quite instructive... Stonewall and its Mafia connections probably needs its own post but I'll start with London...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/74nd3y.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

The story of rock’n’roll in the 60s has been told countless times by the stars who sang the songs, spun the solos or thrashed the drums. In the UK at the time, that most often meant straight white men, as it did in the US. But the people who shaped and advised those artists – the ones who managed the stars of the classic rock age – were, by an outsized margin, gay men...<br>
<br>
That interwoven community included <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Brian Epstein</span> (who brought the world the Beatles)</span>, Kit Lambert (who co-managed the Who), Simon Napier-Bell (the Yardbirds, and a young Marc Bolan), Robert Stigwood (Cream, the Bee Gees), Billy Gaff (Rod Stewart), Ken Pitt (David Bowie), Barry Krost (Cat Stevens), as well as Tony Stratton-Smith (who formed the visionary label Charisma for bands like Genesis). In fact, it was a gay man, Larry Parnes, who svengali-d Britain’s very first rockers, from Tommy Steele to Billy Fury to Marty Wilde.<br>
<br>
Likewise, in the US, you had key LGBTQ music power players like Clive Davis at Columbia Records, Seymour Stein at Sire, <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">David Geffen</span></span> at Asylum, and Danny Fields, who discovered the proto-punk stars Iggy Pop and MC5 for Elektra.<br>
<br>
A new book titled The Velvet Mafia: the Gay Men who Ran the Swinging Sixties aims to tell the British side of this story by focusing on several key players in the scene, including a few of the aforementioned names along with the innovative producer Joe Meek and the head of the UK’s most powerful label at the time, Sir Joseph Lockwood. Author Darryl W Bullock said he tackled the subject because he believes “it’s incredibly important for people to understand that LGBTQ people were not just a part of what created the rock culture we enjoy today, they were the driving force behind it. They were the people who pushed things forward,” he said, “the ones looking for the ‘next big thing’ to kickstart a cultural revolution.”..<br>
<br>
...The man at the start of it all, Larry Parnes, had a complicated relationship with the stars he discovered. On the one hand, he devoted great care to their creative and commercial nurturing. But he also exploited them financially and, at times, sexually. Parnes would often try to sleep with his stars even if they were underage. “Of course, guys like Larry [Parnes] and Brian [Epstein] and Robert Stigwood were trying it on,” Bullock said. “There absolutely was a dodgy aspect to them.”..<br>
<br>
..More, the best of the managers gave the young musicians a confidence and understanding they never would have had otherwise. Some even played crucial creative roles, like Kit Lambert who used his knowledge of the broader world of art and music to push Pete Townshend to create his historic rock opera Tommy...

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Alun Davies Owen (24 November 1925 – 6 December 1994) was a Welsh screenwriter and actor predominantly active in television.

Queer, There, and Everywhere By Michael Koresky  <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6422-queer-there-and-everywhere" class="postlink">https://www.criterion.com/current/posts ... everywhere</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sometimes referred to as “the Fifth Beatle,” Brian Epstein was the band’s manager and the one who discovered them, gave them their look and style, and introduced them to the world; gay and Jewish—thus doubly othered in swinging sixties London—and content to be a behind-the-curtain figure, Epstein is an unassuming sort to be called, by Warren Ellis, “one of the great unsung architects of twentieth-century culture.” Furthering the mystique around Epstein for intrigued queer historians is the fact that Epstein’s gayness was well known by the Fab Four and was allegedly treated by them in a matter-of-fact manner, despite the rampantly homophobic culture of a time in UK history when consensual sexual acts between men were still outlawed...<br>
<br>
The closest bond is said to have existed between Epstein and John Lennon, whose generally open attitudes toward sexuality have been well recorded and published. The central event between the two men that has persisted even to this day as a source of fascination, and which has fueled decades of speculation, occurred in late April and early May in 1963, when the two men vacationed alone together for twelve days in Barcelona, at the same time that Paul, George, and Ringo took a trip to Santa Cruz; Lennon’s first child, Julian, with his first wife, Cynthia, had been born just two weeks prior. ..Wondering what, if anything, went on between Epstein and Lennon is more than the pastime of slash fan-fiction writers. By way of semi-denial, Lennon said to Jan Wenner in Rolling Stone in 1971, “I just went on holiday. I watched Brian picking up the boys. I like playing a bit faggy, all that. It was enjoyable, but there were big rumors in Liverpool, it was terrible.” Thanks to interviews and oral histories over the years—and one unsubstantiated, quite detailed report from Lennon’s childhood friend Pete Shotton in his book In My Life relating that Lennon told him sexual activity did indeed take place—thirst for the truth around the Barcelona trip has never been quenched. ..<br>
<br>
...Locating queer appeal in the mythology of the Beatles is not as idiosyncratic a choice as some may think. The anarchic attitude and easy intimacy of the band, especially as depicted in A Hard Day’s Night, has long offered a twinge of promise for the queer viewer. In that film, the four handsome mop-tops are themselves the queering agents, running roughshod over proper society (“Give us a kiss,” John says at one point to a straight in a suit). Meanwhile, followers of gay British culture might find <span style="color:#FF0040">Richard Lester’s casting of Wilfrid Brambell, who plays Paul’s omnipresent, disconcertingly libidinous “grandfather,” of interest—the gay Brambell had been arrested in a public restroom in 1962 for “indecent acts.”</span> (Queer cinephiles may also know that Brambell would later play Terence Davies’s elderly surrogate in his wrenching 1983 short Death and Transfiguration.) In fact, The Hours and Times, which uses the bathroom as a place of sexual initiation, seems to consciously evoke the playful homoeroticism of A Hard Day’s Night, in which a presumably naked John plays with submarine toys in the bubble bath, while George shaves in the mirror mere feet away.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Deceased actor Wilfred Bramble who played Albert Steptoe in popular BBC sitcom Steptoe and Son has been accused of abusing two boys in the 1970's.<br>
<br>
The allegation was made by a man who was 12 or 13 at the time and a resident at Haut de la Garenne children's home, an institution at the centre of a long running investigation into extensive child abuse over the course of many years.<br>
<br>
The incident involving the gay actor Wilfred Bramble is said to have happened at a theatre in Jersey in the Channel Islands where he is said to have molested two boys.<br>
<br>
“Two of the people who contacted me said that they were abused by Wilfred Brambell." ex Jersey health minister Stuart Syvret told The Daily Telegraph.<br>
<br>
“I was told that he visited the back rooms of the Jersey Opera House and abuse would happen there. I am convinced they were telling the truth. One of the men was a resident at Haut de la Garenne at the time and was taken to the theatre where he was abused.”<br>
<br>
Syvret also divulged to the Daily Mail "The two boys came to me about Brambell because they did not trust the police. They came to me and told me they were sexually abused by him."<br>
<br>
Following the recent revelations from victims of BBC star Jimmy Savile, who has also been accused of incidents of abuse in Jersey, more victims have stepped forward with allegations.<br>
<br>
Bramble, who was often refered to as a 'dirty old man' in one of the most memorable Steptoe comedy catchphrases, rose to fame as the star of Steptoe and Son during the 60's and 70's and also starred alongside The Beatles in the film A Hard Day’s Night, playing the role of Paul McCartney's granddad.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The merchandising scandal of the Beatlemania era known as SeltaeB (Beatles backwards) was kept fairly hush hush certainly during this time as well as many years after. ..<br>
<br>
Seltaeb was a company set up in 1963 to look after the merchandising interests of the Beatles and Brian Epstein. Nicky Byrne was contracted by David Jacobs (Epstein’s lawyer) to head the company on behalf of NEMS Enterprises, Brian Epstein’s management company. Byrne took the contract at a 90% commission rate, leaving only 10% for the Beatles and NEMS combined. Not realizing the potential goldmine for Beatles-related products at the time, Epstein accepted the 10% rate, which has been estimated at a $100,000,000 dollar loss for NEMS and the Beatles.<br>
<br>
Beatles related products began to pour out all over the world in 1964 after Beatlemania was in high gear, launching them up to the highest heights of stardom and beyond. Everything from Beatles chewing gum, to Beatles mop top wigs, to Beatles fudge-sickles, candy, trading cards, jewelry and more began to flood into the aisle ways of every store, and into the homes of every pre-teen and teenager in America and the world. All paying licensing fees to Seltaeb and therefore, Nicky Byrne- who was making an absolute fortune off of the Beatles image...<br>
<br>
.. began to realize that it was this scandal that ultimately made the Beatles such a worldwide phenomenon. How is that? Well obviously it wasn’t the sole reason for the Beatles success, but it was certainly a slice of the entire apple pi(e).  Byrne and Seltaeb licensed out the rights to use the Beatles likeness for pennies on the dollar, making hundreds of outside interests companies salivate over the sale potential of any product marketed with the Beatles likeness adorning it. The Beatles image was marketed worldwide, on thousands of products.  People all over the world who may have never heard a Beatles record, saw the Beatles and their mop-top haircuts and smiling faces on their beauty products, their food, their household items, their clothing, their toys etc. etc. It was really a genius marketing ploy, one that worked very very well for the sensationalized promotion of the Beatles image...<br>
<br>
No doubt Byrne was making a HUGE chunk of Beatles-bucks, and this soon concerned Brian Epstein who was making only 10% of the profit of the entire endeavor. The rate was re-negotiated in 1964 to 49%, however this set Epstein and Byrne on a tormenting 3 year ongoing court battle for negotiations for past monies due. Companies that were once salivating for the Beatles dirt-cheap licensing rights, lost interest waiting for the legalities to finalize during this time. The Beatles sensation had died down quite a bit and by 1966, the Beatles official licensed products had all but disappeared from the public realm.  <span style="color:#FF0040">Before the conclusion of the legalities, Epstein died of what was ruled as an accidental overdose in August 1967. The following year, Epstein’s lawyer David Jacobs was found hanged in his garage in December 1968, and Nicky Byrne retired in the Bahamas.</span>  Well…. hmmm...<br>
<br>
..We may never truly know if Epstein’s death was accidental as ruled. I certainly hope that is the case, and not for a more sinister reason.  However, we do know that Epstein’s close associate, friend and lawyer David Jacobs has indeed had much controversy surrounding his claimed suicide.  <span style="color:#FF0040">There have been reports of Jacobs’ association with the notorious Kray twins, and his refusal to represent them when they were tried for murder</span>. Several attempts by Jacobs’ hiring personal security, asking for police escorts, and confessions to close friends that he was ‘in danger’ or that ‘they were all after him’. There is circumstantial evidence that Jacobs’ was operating under the motivation of blackmail as well. Jacobs’ list of clientele include The Rolling Stones, Larry Olivier, Marlene Dietrich, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Judy Garland, Diana Dors, Brian Epstein – and even, indirectly, the Beatles, all of which have association in one form or another with the Beatles and/or their entourage. And with the exception of Judy Garland and Zsa Zsa Gabore were all featured on the Sgt. pepper album cover… another Beatles coincidence??..<br>
<br>
Epstein on the other hand, is much more secretive and hush hush. Not much has been said about Brian Epstein’s background or daily life besides his deals and interactions with the Beatles and NEMS enterprises. However it has been speculated that he had found himself in some pretty hot water around the time of his death. Not just with the Seltaeb scandal and his fear of the Beatles finding out what a horrible deal he had agreed to, but allegedly he had racked up some significant gambling debts and <span style="color:#FF0040">was part of an underground circle of well-to-do persons who lurked in the shadows of taboo and illegal activities in the early 60s.</span> Epstein was a homosexual at a time in Britain when such a lifestyle was illegal, and heavily frowned upon by society. He was sure to keep most of his private encounters away from the prying eyes of the public. ..  There are several claims of compromising pictures taken of Epstein during Beatles world tours which were used as blackmail against the famed Beatles manager. <span style="color:#FF0040">There are also rumors that Epstein may have used the illegal connections of the Kray twins, soliciting call boys from the notorious mafia-styled gangsters who ran an organized pedophilia ring out of a house in a Suffolk village (Tattington) owned by Ronnie Kray.  </span>The Kray twins had major influence upon the casinos that the likes of David Jacobs and Brian Epstein frequented and possibly owed a significant amount of gambling debt to. Combine that with the underground dealings of call-boys supplied by the Kray twins, bad financial decisions on behalf of the Beatles interests, drug addiction, and possible threats against his life, and you have a very serious dark cloud of speculation and concern storming the manager of the band who made it to the toppermost of the poppermost in a frenzy....<br>
<br>
....Speaking of 50+ years of all-things Beatles- this past June marked the 50th anniversary of the Beatles Sgt. Pepper album.  The occasion was celebrated by repackaging and re-releasing the Sgt. pepper album in new “born again” fashion. Throughout mid-2017 billboards and advertisements all across Liverpool began to appear featuring Brian Epstein. ‘With A Little Help From My Friends‘ is the name of this artwork by award winning artist Jeremy Deller, which features the tagline:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Brian Epstein died for you”</em><br>
<br>
When asked about the inspiration for his art, Deller explained;<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“The phrase, ‘Brian Epstein Died for You’, though short, carries with it ideas of belief and self-sacrifice, two strong aspects of Christianity and indeed most mainstream religions. It could be argued that popular music itself is a belief system, and the phrase ‘Brian Epstein Died for You’, has great meaning to its devotees, as he was such a key figure in its development.” </em>. Source: <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/sgt-pepper-at-50-festival-13085322" class="postlink">https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-o ... l-13085322</a><br>
<br>
Well now, that sounds a lot like many of the concepts discussed on the numbernine in one little neat and tidy quote! Imagine that. He even used a ‘Brian Epstein Died For You’ piece using the Lord Kitchener motif discussed in a previous numbernine article, I Was Lord Kitchener!   That’s pretty fab if you ask me. It begs the question (at least for me) did Epstein die for me/us/the fans? Or for the Beatles well-being? If for the Beatles- did it work?<br>
<br>
By perusing over some of Jeremy Deller’s other artworks, I would have to assume (you know what they say about assuming…) that Deller is very much ‘in the game’. <a href="http://www.jeremydeller.org/Solid/Solid_Video.php" class="postlink">Here</a> you will find a link to some of his work if interested, do be sure to check it out.</div></blockquote>

"Jimmy Savile ... and the Krays worked and played together in the sixties, and were likely involved with the sex trafficking of children to members of the British elite, including via care homes where children were allegedly tortured, even killed.<br>
<br>
"Myra Hindley and Ian Brady frequented the same dance halls where Savile DJ-ed, in Manchester in the 1960s, and Savile talked about being friends with Ian Brady.<br>

"Brady (who grew up in Glasgow before moving to Manchester), bragged about his associations with the Glasgow mafia and the Kray twins.<br>
<br>
"Glasgow was also where the Pedophile Information Exchange (PIE) was founded, in 1975."</div></blockquote>..<br>
<br>
..'Glasgow godfather' Thompson reportedly was selling guns to the UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force). He worked for MI5.<br>

"They then told him he could pretty much start the drugs trade in Glasgow." Arthur Thompson was an associate of the Kray twins. The Kray twins reportedly ran a pedophile ring for top people.<br>

Brady and Hindley's child killings took place in the North of England, near Manchester. But, Ian Brady "implies he may have ... buried bodies at the Campsie Fells near Glasgow.

In fact, it was a gay man, Larry Parnes, who svengali-d Britain’s very first rockers, from Tommy Steele to Billy Fury to Marty Wilde.</em>...&gt;<br>

Kit Lambert <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Lambert" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Lambert</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Christopher Sebastian "Kit" Lambert (11 May 1935 – 7 April 1981) was a British record producer, record label owner, and the manager of The Who...<br>
<br>
..Kit Lambert was the son of composer Constant Lambert and part-time actress Florence Kaye. He was the grandson of George Washington Lambert, a sculptor and painter who was an official war artist for the Australian government at Gallipoli during World War I. His godfather was his father's friend and fellow composer, William Walton.[1] His godmother was Margot Fonteyn, the prima ballerina who danced for Constant's company, the Royal Ballet, and with whom Constant had an affair causing him to leave Lambert's mother.[2] Home life was difficult for Lambert who was sent to live with his grandmother at a young age. When he was 16, his father died at the age of 45...<br>
<br>
After studying history at Trinity College, Oxford, Lambert briefly served as an officer in the British Army; he was stationed in Hong Kong. After his service, in May 1961, he joined an expedition with two Oxford friends, Richard Mason and John Hemming, in an attempt to discover the source of the Iriri River in the Amazon. Lambert hoped to film the expedition as a documentary. On 3 September, Mason was killed by an uncontacted Amazon tribe known as the Panará while he was alone hunting for food. Lambert was initially arrested on suspicion of murdering his friend but, after a concerted campaign in Britain by the Daily Express newspaper, which had financed the expedition, he was released. After returning to the United Kingdom, Lambert became an assistant director (AD) on the films The Guns of Navarone, From Russia with Love, and The L-Shaped Room which is where he met fellow AD, Chris Stamp brother of actor Terence Stamp...<br>
<br>
...At the peak of his success Lambert owned a flat in Knightsbridge, London, and<span style="color:#FF0040">Palazzo Dario on the Grand Canal in Venice, where he was known as Baron Lambert. Lambert claimed that he was conceived in Venice and hence was connected to the city. His neighbour was the heiress and renowned Modern Art collector, Peggy Guggenheim, with whom Lambert was rumoured to be romantically linked.</span> However, back in the UK his excessive drug use brought him to the attention of the British police and he was arrested and charged with possession of heroin. As a defence, and one rarely used, a lawyer convinced Lambert to become a Ward of the Court of Protection whereby he would avoid drug charges and a potential prison sentence while an Official Solicitor would take charge of his affairs. As a ward Kit would be provided with a small weekly stipend out of his own money to live on amounting to approximately £150/week. This, even though royalties from the albums that Lambert produced for the Who and Hendrix were steadily increasing each year...<br>
<br>
.. Lambert died of a cerebral hemorrhage after falling down a flight of stairs. On the night of his death, he was seen drinking heavily at a<span style="color:#FF0040"> popular Kensington homosexual watering hole, El Sombrero, where, according to many, including Townshend, he was beaten up by a drug dealer over an unpaid debt</span>, which contributed to his fall and death. In his autobiography Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Guy, record producer Tony Visconti stated: "He [Lambert] was already in advanced stages of whatever. He died when a coke dealer pushed him downstairs.</div></blockquote>

El Sombrero was a notorious gay bar/disco that attracted all the big names of the day...<br>

I used to frequent the Sombrero club in the early 1970's. The clubs name was actually 'Yours or Mine'. It was truly was the best gay club in London at that time. The underlit dance floor was very unusual and it added to the fun. The description of the club by the author does not fit my memory - but he is talking about 1976 - aftr my time. I think the manager Amedeo was still there and also Jaunito the waiter both were Italian. I have just started a Tribute to the Sombrero group on Facebook. If anyone has any memories please post them on the site...<br>

..I used to work there, so I was very happy to find this blog,was always wondering what happen to all my friends,spoke to Mr <span style="color:#FF0040">Harry Laubscher</span> a few month ago,he's well and lives in Switzerland,last thing I've heard that Amado poured Gasoline over his friend and set him on fire,does anybody ever run into Monica Shell or Ashley Lloyd Johnson? I was actually working at the restaurant but helps at the club from the very beginning, Harry didn't want to opened it because of his reputation but then we kinda talk to him into it and he sure made some money with it...
</div></blockquote>

So, there is some incorrect information in that blog.. El Sombrero was owned by Harry Laubscher who came from a Swiss banking family : <a href="http://swissgay.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Laubscher-Harry-11.pdf" class="postlink">http://swissgay.info/wp-content/uploads ... rry-11.pdf</a><br>
<br>
Some points from that article:<br>
Laubscher talks about his time as a young man with the Swiss army.  Then he first went into banking and was initially sent to London by Schweizerischer Bankverein [now UBS]. In 1955 he lived in Kensington. He soon opened up a couple of cafes serving coffee and tea. One was Sombrero. At some point a fire destroyed his cafe, he thinks it may have been arson but he soon reopened. In 1962 he opened a club in the basement of Sombrero [called Yours or Mine].  His club was one of THE places to go to in London [it was here that David Bowie met Freddi Burretti who would help to transform his career with the Ziggy Stardust costumes <a href="http://www.5years.com/keypeoplefb.htm" class="postlink">http://www.5years.com/keypeoplefb.htm</a>] ... <span style="color:#FF0040">Judy Garland was a friend and visited his club 3 days before her death</span>...Laubscher returned to Switzerland when his friend was killed.<br>
<br>
What that article does not mention is Laubscher's connection to the mob..  An article from the Guardian, 1957 <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=14586992&amp;fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjI1OTUwNjMzMywiaWF0IjoxNjI2NTA2MjY0LCJleHAiOjE2MjY1OTI2NjR9.hvdYjKlHl9eepf9MDhhgB_APowGrWAjE5tQfw3ssOj8" class="postlink">https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipp ... tQfw3ssOj8</a><br>

Bernie Silver <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Silver" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Silver</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Bernard Silver[1] (December 1922 – 2002) was an English criminal, who was a leading crime boss in the London underworld of the 1950s to 1970s. <span style="color:#FF0040">Active in prostitution, pornography and racketeering,</span> Silver was described as "a working-class East Ender with a taste for fine restaurants and flashy clothes."..<br>
<br>
Silver was born in Hackney, London,[3] into a Jewish family to Emily V (née Saunders) and Louis Silver,[4] and had three younger brothers: Raymond, Dennis and Ronald.[5][better source needed]<br>
<br>
Silver's rise to prominence began in the mid 1950s with the absorption of the remnants of the Messina Brothers prostitution operation into what came to be known as "The Syndicate",[6] a criminal organisation headed principally by Silver and former <span style="color:#FF0040">Maltese traffic policeman "Big Frank" Mifsud</span> who worked in olive oil importation when he first came to London.[7][8][9] In 1956, Silver was arrested and charged for living off immoral earnings but was inexplicably let off by the judge who decided there was no case to answer. Starting off with one stripclub in Bower Street, by the late 1960s the duo controlled 19 of the 24 stripclubs in Soho.[4]<br>
<br>
During the heyday of the Syndicate (1967–1972), most of the Metropolitan Police Obscene Publications Squad were in its pay, including the squad's head, Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Moody.[10]<br>
<br>
Silver's influence began to wane as the 1970s wore on, a decline prompted by major investigations into police corruption that by the end of 1972 had led to the resignation of eighty detectives.[11] The discovery of a detailed ledger of the Syndicate's police payoffs during a raid on the home of Silver's associate Jimmy Humphreys led to the dismissal or forced retirement of hundreds of Metropolitan Police officers;[12] corruption trials in 1976–77 resulted in thirteen detectives—including two ex-Commanders, the highest-ranking British police officers ever to be convicted of corruption—being sentenced to a total of 90 years in prison.[10]<br>
<br>
In 1973, Silver was again arrested and charged for living off immoral earnings for renting out a room above one of their stripclubs to dancers who also worked as prostitutes. He was sentenced to 6 years in prison, <span style="color:#FF0040">with Mifsud going on the run before getting caught in Switzerland and deported back to England. However, Mifsud appealed and got his sentenced quashed and he then returned to his native Malta.</span>[4]<br>
<br>
Silver was convicted on 8 July 1975 of the 25 June 1956 murder of Tommy "Scarface" Smithson.[1][13] He was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and to ten years imprisonment for conspiracy to murder, but later cleared on appeal.[14] Smithson was a former boxer and navy merchant stoker who had been attempting to control prostitution in Soho.[15]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The BFI Flipside series consists of reissues on disc (DVD and Blu-Ray) of forgotten Brit films, and each and every one is proving crucial viewing for anyone with even the slightest interest in the history of British cinema. Many of the flicks are simultaneously incredible documents of the emergence of swinging London and the subsequent come-downs from that high.<br>
<br>
The oldest movie in the latest round of Flipside releases is That Kind Of Girl (dir. Gerry O'Hara, 1963). It's the tale of a swinging Austrian au pair called Eva (Margaret Rose Keil), who catches the clap from seedy middle-age advertising executive Elliot Collier (Peter Burton) and passes it on to two younger men. Obviously the scenes of sex kitten Eva getting her dose of syphilis and spreading it around prove more fun than later episodes covering her cure at the Special Clinic. Nonetheless, fast-paced editing keeps the film moving and not even the educational sections will bore you. Indeed, the sight of a doctor quoting 1963 UK syphilis infection rates to a Special Clinic nurse as if she didn't already know them might make you laugh: "14,000 new cases a year - and most of them young people."<br>
<br>
Eva's first boyfriend is working class autodidact Max (Frank Jarvis) who <span style="color:#FF0040">picks her up at the El Sombrero coffee shop</span>. By the 1970s (and probably also in the 1960s) this was a concession beneath The Sombrero Restaurant in High Street Kensington. Right at the start of That Kind Of Girl, we see Eva getting off a 31 bus and walking along a stretch of High Street Kensington before going into the entrance of The Sombrero. This sequence was shot in the early Sixties at a time when the 31 bus ran between Notting Hill and Chelsea, the route was changed on 29 May 1999. In That Kind Of Girl, we cut from Eva going into The Sombrero to her appearance in the El Sombrero coffee shop. I assume this would have entailed going down a flight of stairs but that isn't shown. <span style="color:#FF0040">When my swinging mother Julia Callan-Thompson, who was part of the beatnik scene that Max also represents, arrived in London at the start of the 1960s, El Sombrero was one of the places she hung out.</span> Barry Miles provides a description of the place from a later era in his new book London Calling: A Countercultural History of London Since 1945 (Grove Atlantic, pages 319-320):<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">"El Sombrero, in the basement below the Sombrero restaurant, distinguished by its Mexican hat neon sign, at 142 Kensington High Street, was a popular hangout in the late seventies. </span>For a time Derek Jarman, Ossie Clarke, Angie and David Bowie, Mick Jagger and Bianca, Long John Baldry and Dusty Springfield could be found there every week, and even Francis Bacon sometimes peeped in. It was the first disco in London to have coloured underfloor neon lighting beneath its flashing, star-shaped, glass dance floor. There was a raised section overlooking the dance floor which could be reserved by ordering champagne. To comply with licensing laws, everyone was given a paper plate with a thin slice of pork pie and a smear of coleslaw. That way you could dance until 2 a.m. for a couple of shillings. The patron was Amadeo, known to all as Armadillo, who sat at the bottom of the steep staircase, counting the pound notes. The waiters Jose and Manuel balanced glasses on trays held high above their heads as they weaved their perilous way through the crowds. It was mostly a gay club and later changed its name to Yours or Mine?"<br>
<br>
Papers of my mother's that survived her death in 1979 indicate that in the late Fifties and early Sixties El Sombrero was run by Harry Laubscher. The venue must have been revamped between then and the late seventies because the interior in That Kind Of Girl looks quite different to 1970s descriptions of it as a gay disco. While I've come across other references to The Sombrero and El Sombrero in this latter period (for example in Bertie Marshall’s biography Berlin Bromley), That Kind Of Girl provides the first reference I've found to its earlier beatnik incarnation from a source other than my mother's papers.</div></blockquote>

Coincidentally, 142 Kensington High Street is now a Santander bank branch ... *cough*..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ronnie and Reggie Kray were twins from Bethnal Green of London’s East End. Both of the twins as teenagers were keen boxers both were very good at amateur level. The boys boxing days was inspired by their grandfather Jimmy “Cannonball” Lee. The twins fought at the Royal Albert Hall with their older brother Charlie Kray on the same card as them on 11th of December 1951. The twins didn’t become professional boxers but turned to becoming night club owners in the late 1950s as they purchased a run down snooker club in Mile End where they started several protection rackets. Ronnie was sentenced to 18 months in prison for running a protection racket and related threats . Peter Rachman, head of a landlord operation, gave Reggie a nightclub called Esmeralda’s Barn on the Knightsbridge end of Wilton Place... Famous faces such as Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra entered their club. MPs and Lords would also visit the club. They gained celebrity status which caught attention of Detective Superintendent Leonard “Nipper” Read who was the head of bringing the Krays into justice and the South London gang called the Richardson’s ..<br>

Looking at them it reminded me of ARK ... that's when I found this document.. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">Education not for Sale</span> <a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/Education_Not_For_Sale_Repor_Report.pdf" class="postlink">https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/fi ... Report.pdf</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...After the 2010 election, education companies became more bullish in response to<br>
the political climate, and the new magazine ‘Education Investor’ grew like the<br>
business it reports. In May 2012, when Michael Gove, giving evidence to the<br>
Leveson Inquiry, was asked if it was his view that the government might eventually<br>
move to allowing for-profit operators into the free schools market, he said 'it's my<br>
belief that we could move to that situation...but...I think we should cross that<br>
bridge when we come to it'. The widespread expectation was that the bridge<br>
would be the 2015 election campaign or the early days of a Conservative<br>
administration to follow.<br>
Indeed, at a conference held in London in February 2014 by ‘Education Investor’,<br>
entitled “Private Equity in Education”, <span style="color:#FF0040">one of the speakers indicated that, in<br>
private, ministers were very open to the idea of profit-making in relation to English<br>
education in general, and private equity involvement specifically.</span><br>
Speaking in the opening session of the conference, which was entitled “Education<br>
is the hot sector in private equity firms right now. Why? And can it deliver?”, <span style="color:#FF0040">Aatif<br>
Hassan, a partner in the firm August Equity</span>, said: “The current government is<br>
offering a pretty positive environment [to private equity in education]. Gove and<br>
his advisers are very pro private equity, and very pro-private. I’m sure if you got<br>
them under Chatham House rules, or spoke to them privately, they would back the<br>
[private] ownership of state schools, and of the involvement of for-profits in the<br>
state system.<br>
<br>
“The political risk [for private equity] is what happens after 2015. But at the<br>
moment, it’s pretty positive.”<br>
<br>
Hassan added that the value of a good education was that it was not available to<br>
everyone. He said: “If 100 per cent of the people in the UK had an Oxford<br>
education, the value of it would come down, because there is no value in<br>
something everyone has. Even it’s a great education.<br>
“Do not get me wrong: it would be great for the world to have a great education<br>
for the population. But in terms of doing what education is supposed to be doing<br>
for the client [the student], it would not work.”<br>
<br>
Jose Rodriguez, a director of Sovereign Capital, the private equity firm co-founded<br>
by the education minister Lord Nash, said: “We decided over 10 years ago to focus<br>
on education as one of our key sectors.“<br>
And Matthew Robb, a partner at The Parthenon Group, which sponsored the<br>
event and describes itself as having a “vision to the leading strategic advisor to the<br>
global education industry”48, said there were “lots of opportunities” in the early<br>
years sector of English education. He said: “Of every [sector of education] it’s the<br>
closest to a voucher system. Therefore, there are lots of opportunities in<br>
nurseries.”

Pretty outrageous stuff. More here...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mr Frayne also once worked for Sterling in Europe, a pressure group, alongside<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Dominic Cummings</span>, who served as a special adviser to Gove from 2011 to early<br>
2014. Cummings is married to Mary Wakefield, deputy editor of the Spectator,<br>
which runs a well-attended annual conference on school reform and is a supporter<br>
of Gove’s approach. Before working for Gove at the DfE and even prior to the 2010 election, Cummings worked informally as an adviser to Gove and is<br>
reported to have emailed Gove after the election with a request that the New<br>
Schools Network (NSN) be handed ‘cash without delay’.66<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">One academy organisation, ARK Schools, was co-founded by the hedge fund<br>
financier Arpad Busson</span>; its trustees, as of December 2013, were drawn almost<br>
exclusively from the ranks of fellow financiers. Several individuals with<br>
connections to ARK also hold very powerful positions within national education<br>
quangos. Sir Michael Wilshaw is a former director of education at ARK who left<br>
in 2011 to become Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools, or effectively Ofsted’s<br>
chief executive. The chair at Ofsted is Baroness Sally Morgan<br>
He then worked for the<br>
NSN from July to December 2010. When his departure as a special adviser was<br>
revealed in October 2013, Mr Cummings was reported as leaving to run a free<br>
school.  <br>
<br>
At Ofqual, the school qualifications regulator, the corresponding position of chair<br>
is held by Amanda Spielman. Ms Spielman was one of the founding managers of<br>
ARK Schools and was serving as its research and development director at the time<br>
she was appointed to the Ofqual post in 2011. After her appointment, she was<br>
listed on Ofqual’s website as remaining an ‘education adviser’ to ARK Schools.<br>
, who was an<br>
adviser to ARK, the charity overseeing Ark Schools, for at least five years from<br>
2006. She remained in this position after taking up the position at Ofsted in 2011.<br>
She is a former official adviser to the New Schools Network.<br>
68<br>
Ms Spielman has a business and banking background and is a former trustee of the<br>
New Schools Network.Meanwhile, the Department for Education’s board now has<br>
as its lead non-executive director Paul Marshall, chairman of ARK Schools and<br>
another former adviser to the New Schools Network who is also chairman and<br>
chief executive of Marshall Wace LLP, which the DfE describes as ‘one of Europe’s<br>
leading hedge fund groups’...<br>
<br>
...The other individual mentioned by the academy chain source was David Hoare.<br>
He co-founded Talisman, a management consultancy firm, in 1987 having<br>
previously worked for <span style="color:#FF0040">Bain and Company, another management consultancy with<br>
links to Mitt Romney</span>. Bain carried out a spending review for the DfE in 2012-13<br>
proposing 50 per cent cutbacks to the department’s budget over the Parliamentary<br>
term 2010-15. Mr.Hoare’s biography on Talisman’s website lists him as a director<br>
of the Tom Attwood Academy Trust. Official information on any position in<br>
relation to the Department for Education is hard to come across, but an<br>
announcement of Sir Bruce Liddington’s departure as chief executive of the E-Act<br>
academy chain in April 2013 said that Sir Bruce would be ‘working with David<br>
Hoare, an independent consultant, who is providing pro-bono advice to the<br>
Department on developing high quality academy sponsors’....</div></blockquote></div>

Etienne Davignon?  <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..On February 2, 1997, X1 recognized Katrien de Cuyper in a series of images he was shown. She explained how this girl was taken to a castle and murdered by a group of individuals including Tony, Nihoul and Bouty. [109] Before she was killed, X1 noticed that Katrien seemed much more uncomfortable than more experienced girls. She thought this girl had been recruited by Tony.<br>
<br>
After X1 gave a description of the castle and the route it had traveled, investigators were able to find the estate in question: Kattenhof Castle in Gravenwezel, owned by the Caters family. [110] It turned out that this family had several properties in Knokke in the streets where X1 had already reported certain apartments where she had been mistreated. [111] Baron Patrick de Caters, co-owner of the Caters estate, is a member of the Cercle de Wallonië, with <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Etienne Davignon</span></span>, Prince Philippe de Chimay, Count Jean-Pierre de Launoit (vice-president Cercle de Lorraine), Elio Di Rupo and Aldo Vastapane. <span style="color:#FF0040">All of these men have been accused of abusing and raping children at some point</span>, although it has to be argued that some of the charges are more reliable than others. In addition, next to the domain of Caters, the castle of Axel Vervoordt can be found. Vervoordt is a famous art collector, who counts international stars and businessmen among his clientele. He too has been accused of pedophilia. But we'll get to that later....<br>
<br>
...The influence of Société Générale on the Belgian economy has always been immense, controlling between 25 and 50% of the Belgian manufacturing industry. [181] It was only in 1988 that the unimaginable happened: the French group Suez took over the bank, and with it, a big chunk of the Belgian economy. <span style="color:#FF0040">Viscount Etienne Davignon </span>was appointed president and held this position until 2001. Count Maurice Lippens became vice-president of the bank...<br>
<br>
..Another important aristocratic Belgian company is the chemical giant Solvay, founded in 1863 by the Solvay family. It became public in 1967, but the Solvay and Boël families were able to retain control over the company through their holding Union Financière Boël. The Janssens, De Selliers De Moranvilles and Karel van Miert are also major shareholders of Solvay, or of the Solvac holding. In 2003, Van Miert replaced <span style="color:#FF0040">Etienne Davignon as director of Solvay</span>....<br>
<br>
Besides the royal family, Viscount Etienne Davignon is probably the best known of this group internationally. Although he comes from a less influential family than the others listed here, Davignon may well be continental Europe's most influential person in the process of globalization, with particular emphasis on mainstreaming the Europe in the sense of Anglo-Saxon liberal policies. In addition to his positions in the above companies, Davignon has held (or still holds) the following positions:<br>
<br>
First President of the International Energy Agency (IEA)<br>
<br>
Director of Kissinger Associates and good friend of Henry Kissinger<br>
<br>
Director of Minorco / Anglo-American Corporation<br>
<br>
Vice-President of the European Commission<br>
<br>
Co-founder of the European Round Table of Industrialists with someone who worked at different times for the Rockefellers, the Kissinger, the Rothschilds and the Lazard Bank<br>
<br>
Co-founder and president of the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe<br>
<br>
President of CSR Europe (European business network)<br>
<br>
Founder of the EU-Japan Industrial Cooperation Center<br>
<br>
President of the EU-Japan Economic Dialogue<br>
<br>
Co-founder and president of Friends of Europe<br>
<br>
· Allegedly a former governor of Ditchley, a very elitist Anglo-American-Canadian network.<br>
<br>
· Director of the European Institute until the early 2000s, with former Secretary of State and President of the Kissinger Associates Lawrence Eagleburger and other American and European elites. The board was and is chaired by Andre Yves-Istel de Rothschild, Inc.<br>
<br>
President of the Royal Institute of International Relations (Belgian version of RIIA)<br>
<br>
Member of the American Council on Foreign Relations<br>
<br>
Member of the Trilateral Commission<br>
<br>
Honorary Chairman of Bilderberg<br>
<br>
One of Davignon's closest collaborators in business and the process of globalization is Count Maurice Lippens, whom he really got to know in the late 1980s, when they both ran Société Générale. Together they also headed the Belgian branch of the Dutch-Belgian bank Fortis and they created SN Brussels Airlines. Maurice visited Bilderberg in 2000, 2002 and 2006 and has become an annual visitor to the Trilateral Commission in recent years. Regarding these meetings, he said:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“I have never visited DAVOS and I think it is a great carnival. I get the membership lists and I can already call any of the interesting people there. I enjoy visiting Bilderberg and the Trilateral Commission. The industrial roundtable is interesting, but I am not a member because I am not an industrialist ... Talking about the future of the world is a difficult thing by the way I want to listen and network at Washington with the Trilateral Commission. You will hear interesting trends firsthand. "[184]<br>
</em><br>
<br>
Now why is all this of any importance you ask yourself?<br>
<br>
Well, for starters, because the Lippens family appears in the X-Files.<br>
<br>
 X1, X2, X4 and two anonymous letters, named Maurice Lippens and his brother Léopold, the long-time mayor of Knokke, as evil and sadistic child rapists, not only involved in regular rapes, but also in the network. of "snuff" movies. [185] In addition, a relative of the latter, Count François Lippens, Honorary Consul General of Belgium, appears somewhere in the Dutroux file....<br>
<br>
..Etienne Davignon is another person whose name appears in the X-Files, although he was not involved to the same extent as the Lippens family. X2, the police officer, was apparently the only one to mention him as a participant in orgies, along with the Lippens brothers, where underage girls were raped:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Orgies with underage girls in the Cromwel hotel in Knokke Present: Delvoie - Karel - X2 - Lippens - Van Gheluwe - Etienne Davignon The girls knew where to go and with whom. Lippens hits the little girls Several meetings between Karel and Davignon In the Memling hotel with the two Lippens. "[187]</em>..<br>
<br>
..Have you ever noticed how much Solvay seems to come back a number of times? <span style="color:#FF0040">Etienne Davignon, Karel van Miert and Guy De Selliers De Moranville were all directors of this company</span>. But there is more. Les Boëls and Janssens, the two main shareholders of Solvay, were accused of drug and child trafficking in 1999, alongside Dossiers-X. [193] Françoise Dehaye, whose husband was named by X2 as part of the abuse network [194], is responsible for quality and innovation at Solvay. The gamekeeper and / or forester of La Hulpe, the Solvay family castle, has been accused of being a brutal child molester. [195] And the strange declarations on the Château des Amerois, belonging to the Solvay family, which also appear in the Dutroux file? ...<br>
<br>
..In Belgium, at least, the evidence seems to point to a network of criminals, fascist activists, businessmen, police officers and child molesters who frequently meet in clubs like "Les Atrebates", "le Dolo ”,“ Jonathan ”,“ Le Clin D'Œil ”,“ Co-Cli-Co ”,“ Platos ”,“ Les Trois Canards ”,“ Coco Beach ”,“ Le Perroquet ”,“ Euro 92 ”( bar in Tervueren) or the prestigious “Mirano”. Child abuse reportedly occurred regularly in the private quarters of these clubs, or perhaps after closing, some evenings or in nearby apartments owned by the club owner. Moreover, X1 very convincingly pointed out that his grandmother's hotel-villa, one of Annie Bouty's houses and the factory of ASCO were other similar “safe houses” for various forms of child abuse. Other witnesses reported a whole range of other villas, country houses and castles where abuse sessions had taken place...<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">Child Focus, or the European Center for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children</span>, was founded in 1998 by Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer and has been headed by this person ever since. In 2005, <span style="color:#FF0040">de Lichtbuer became president of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC), headquartered in Washington </span>and which was founded in 1999. Who is this Lichtbuer? First of all, he is very big in the financial world, with former positions at Banque Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian Bankers Association, VP Bank Liechtenstein (with Nikolaus von Liechtenstein), Thomas Cook Traveler Checks and the European Financial Marketing Association. He was also executive chairman of the aristocratic Europa Nostra. But things become really problematic when we learn that de Lichtbuer is a member of the honorary committee of the Cercle de Lorraine, along with Maurice Lippens and <span style="color:#FF0040">Etienne Davignon</span>. Equally worrying is his position as honorary executive chairman of the Koninklijke Vereniging der Historische Woonsteden en Tuinen van België, together with Prince Alexandre de Merode (former chairman) and Count Ghislain d'Ursel. Davignon was also a member of the board of directors...<br>
<br>
There is another indication that de Lichtbuer might not be the best choice for an organization against child abuse: 1998, Stef Janssens, 'The names of the cover-up', p. 33: “In 1989, Nicolas de Kerchove d'Ousselghem (<span style="color:#FF0040">Cercle Pinay</span>, CEPIC, chief of staff of Vanden Boeynants, VdB contact with the intelligence organization BIP) and Paul Vankerkhoven, member of CEPIC and co-founder of the Cercle des Nations [And the founder of WACL Belgium, as well as a visitor from the Cercle Pinay] ... were employees of the review 'Revue Belge' ”. This right-wing magazine had as its director the current director of the Center for Missing Children and former BBL-director Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, which in itself is not reprehensible, but says something about the environment in which the current director of this center has been involved. To clarify, this environment seems to be the highest social environment in which childhood violence is practiced.</div></blockquote></div>
