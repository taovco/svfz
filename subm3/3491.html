In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. A previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through the use of unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia. Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which formed a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing.

Re Prof. Vladimír Sedlák... here's a paper he co-authored for the <span style="color:#FF0040">2nd FIG Regional Conference Marrakech, Morocco, December 2-5, 2003</span> :<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The 2nd FIG Regional Conference was arranged in Marrakech, Morocco December 2-5, 2003 under the high patronage of His Majesty the King Mohammed VI. It was organised by the International Federation of Surveyors, FIG and the Ordre National des Ingénieurs Géomètres-Topographes ONIGT, which is the FIG member association of Morocco. Like the 1st FIG Regional Conference, which was held in Nairobi, Kenya in 2001 this 2nd conference was co-sponsored by several United Nations’ agencies including FAO, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UN ECA). Further co-sponsors included the Arab Union of Surveyors (AUS), which also had its Executive Committee meeting during the conference, as well as the Arab Urban Development Institute.<br>
<br>
The total number of participants exceeded 420 representing more than 40 countries. Even though the focus of the conference was in the Arabic countries and Francophone Africa the participation covered the whole world. Totally 14 countries from the region were present at the conference even though sometimes it is easier to travel via Europe. FIG Council and Commission officers meetings and annual meeting of Commission 3 (Spatial Information Management) and open meetings of Commission 5 (Measurement and Positioning) attracted national delegates from Europe, Asia, America and Australia.<br>
<br>
The conference was organised under the theme of “Urban-rural interrelationship for sustainable environment”, which is one of the hot topics in the international discussion at the moment. Therefore it was encouraging that the UN agencies that are mostly involved in this topic participated. The contributions at the plenary sessions were given by Don Okpala from UN-Habitat, David Palmer from FAO and Svein Tveitdal from UNEP, who is also the new UNEP focal point for FIG. During the conference future co-operation between UNEP and FIG was discussed. It was agreed that the joint activities will include projects on environmental risk and disaster management and capacity building on environmental issues. FIG has further established a new joint commission working group on “risk management – preventing environmental catastrophes by spatial planning and land management..</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Well now a Canadian man challenged the courts on this issue..<br>
<br>
Here's the MSM version of what happened: <span style="color:#00FF40">Justice Centre statement about “Freedom Fighter Court Victory” video </span><a href="https://www.jccf.ca/justice-centre-statement-about-freedom-fighter-court-victory-video/" class="postlink">https://www.jccf.ca/justice-centre-stat ... ory-video/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>POSTED ON: AUGUST 5, 2021<br>
<br>
Our legal team has reviewed the video circulating entitled: “Freedom Fighter Court VICTORY! Ends Masking, Shots, Quarantine in Alberta!” that aired on a Stew Peters broadcast, August 3, 2021, announcing: “Patrick King is a proud father of 2, Freedom Fighter and Patriot who took on the powerful government in Alberta, and WON!”<br>
<br>
The Justice Centre has also reviewed some of the available associated legal documents regarding Court File Number 12110 00751 Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, arising out of a ticket given to Patrick James King, a resident of Penhold, Alberta, issued to Mr. King for allegedly contravening an Order under S.73(1) of the Public Health Act, Provincial Court action number A87988036R. Excerpts of one available transcript can be found below.<br>
<br>
The video appears to contain several inaccuracies.  It is unclear whether Mr. King fully understands the legal process he is involved in.  It appears that Mr. King was unsuccessful in his attempt to subpoena Alberta’s Chief Medical Health Officer. In the government’s filed Originating Application, July 16, 2021, the government notes Mr. King obtained a subpoena for the CMOH Dr. Deena Hinshaw to give evidence in the Provincial Court proceeding (the ticket case). The subpoena was issued by a Justice of the Peace under the Criminal Code, requesting the CMOH bring “all white papers describing the isolation of the COIVD-19 aka SARS-CoV-2 virus in human beings, directly from a sample taken from a diseased patient”, because “these white papers would have been integral in the crafting of the statutes made under the “Public Health Act” here in Alberta.”<br>
<br>
The Government argued the subpoena was technically deficient and the Justice of the Peace had no jurisdiction to issue it. The Government further stated, Mr. King has “no evidence” showing that “the evidence sought from the CMOH is likely to be material” [legal term for meaning relevant and related] to the provincial court ticket received. “It is clear that Mr. King seeks evidence relating to the rationale for orders issued by the CMOH under the Act: he seeks evidence about the ‘Crafting of the statutes’,” stated the Government’s Affidavit. There do not appear to be any critical admissions by Dr. Hinshaw about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and this document has been prepared by the government’s legal team, not Dr. Hinshaw...<br>
<br>
The Judge hearing the case informed the Accused, Mr. Patrick King, that he had not properly filed a Charter challenge against the law as required to fight the law itself, and thus could only address the ticket issued to him.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">There is no indication that Mr. King’s case is connected to the relaxing of Covid restrictions in Alberta which fully opened on July 1, 2021. </span>The Government of Alberta states they have opened the province due to achieving the government’s stated goal of 70% of Albertans receiving their first vaccine. Whether that is the reason, remains to be discovered in future court  hearings...<br>
<br>
he Justice Centre’s Charter challenge against lockdowns, first filed in December 2020, is still proceeding in Court.</div></blockquote>

Here's what Patrick King said happened: <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/EC1fCOHmISEd/" class="postlink">https://www.bitchute.com/video/EC1fCOHmISEd/</a><br>
<br>
And here's Alberta's Chief Medical Officer:<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">Alberta to remove most COVID-19 isolation, testing requirements by mid-August </span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-covid-requirements-1.6121002" class="postlink">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton ... -1.6121002</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Changes will occur in two-phases: Phase 1 starts Thursday, Phase 2 on Aug. 16<br>
<br>
Albertans who test positive for COVID-19 will no longer be required to enter isolation starting in less than three weeks, the province's chief medical officer of health said Wednesday.<br>
<br>
While a recent rise in COVID-19 cases has caused some anxiety, increasing vaccination rates are limiting the threat of severe outcomes and strains on the health-care system, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said during a news conference. <br>
<br>
As a result, <span style="color:#FF0040">the province will start making COVID-19 protocols similar to those of the flu and other communicable diseases</span>...</div></blockquote>
