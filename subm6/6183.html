<blockquote class="uncited"><div>WASHINGTON (ChurchMilitant.com) - A medical institute directed by Dr. Anthony Fauci is paying more than $200,000 to use monkeys in so-called transgender studies.<br>
<br>
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), paid $205,562 to Scripps Research in December to ascertain why gender-confused men have high rates of HIV. NIH confirms the study slated for this year involves injecting male monkeys with feminizing hormones to determine how the hormone therapy impacts the monkeys' immune systems.<br>
<br>
One neuroscientist, Dr. Katherine Roe, labeled the study "ineffective" because monkeys can't contract HIV. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://www.churchmilitant.com/images/social_images/Dr._Katherine_Roe.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Dr. Katherine Roe<br>
<br>
It's unclear why NIAID is paying to determine why biological men, who are so-called transgender women, have a higher incidence of HIV as men who identify as women typically have sex with other men; the CDC already reports gay and bisexual men have a far greater chance of contracting HIV. Studies show transgender people are nearly 50 times more at risk of getting HIV compared to the general population.<br>
<br>
But NIAID also awarded $272,626 in taxpayer funding to Scripps Research in 2021 to likewise give monkeys transgender hormones and "see what happens."<br>
<br>
A year after Catholic-raised Fauci took charge of NIAID in 1984, the agency began HIV vaccine experiments on monkeys. Reports further show a pharmaceutical company provides the health institute with approximately 500 rhesus monkeys each year, to the tune of $27.5 million.<br>
<br>
Roe also noted it was "yet another pointless, wasteful monkey torture experiment."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Torturing Puppies, People</span><br>
<br>
The 66-year-old government institute routinely uses and arguably abuses animals in its experiments. In November 2020, NIAID made headlines when it was exposed for subjecting beagles to infected sand flies for nearly two years in its research of an anti-parasitic drug before euthanizing and dissecting the helpless animals.<br>
<br>
The 66-year-old government institute routinely uses and arguably abuses animals in its experiments.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the White Coat Waste Project reports that in another NIAID-supported study researching the effects of HIV drugs on beagles, the vocal cords of 44 puppies were severed to silence their cries. They were also euthanized at the completion of the study.<br>
<br>
The federal institute, which claims to have improved the health of millions of people in the United States and around the world, likewise treats the unborn in ghastly ways. In May of 2021, it was reported that NIAID paid millions of taxpayer dollars to the University of Pittsburgh to conduct barbaric experiments on aborted babies. Researchers involved themselves in organ harvesting and infant scalping. Horrific video released at the time showed the scalps of 5-month-old aborted babies sewn onto the backs of lab rats.<br>
<br>
In 2021, David Daleiden exposed a University of Pittsburgh scientist, who explained his "protocol for harvesting the freshest, most pristine livers from 5-month-old aborted babies in order to isolate massive numbers of stem cells for experimental transplants."<br>
<br>
Daleiden explained the technique "calls for aborting late-term fetuses alive via labor induction, rushing them to a sterile laboratory, washing them and then cutting them open to harvest the liver."<br>

<br>
Daleiden further reports NIH paid the scientist $3 million for the research. Costs of the baby scalp study was covered by a $430,000 grant from Fauci's NIAID.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Transgender Research</span><br>
<br>
The NIAID reportedly has forked over millions of dollars to study HIV transmission in self-identified transgenders. This includes giving $155,000 to a researcher at the University of Alabama to study how testosterone treatment for women potentially weakens disease-fighting micro-organisms in the vagina. It also includes the agency paying researchers at Emory University more than $230,000 to study how transgenders' rectal immune cells affect HIV risk.<br>
<br>
The studies come at a time when ... transgenders' mental health issues are not only left unfunded but the therapy to treat them is being outlawed.<br>
<br>
The agency's multimillion-dollar studies come at a time when the transgender movement is raging and transgenders' mental health issues are not only left unfunded but the therapy to treat them is being outlawed at home and abroad. Numerous studies show people who suffer from gender dysphoria don't need to be protected from HIV, but rather, protected from psychological illness.<br>
<br>
A 2019 article in The American Journal of Psychiatry noted: "Numerous studies indicate that transgender individuals — that is, individuals who experience incongruity between their sex assigned at birth and their current gender identity — are at particular risk of psychological distress."  It further noted that transgender surgery doesn't provide the mental health benefit that those who identify as the opposite sex often seek.</div></blockquote></div>
