<strong class="text-strong">Tanzanian president blames lab after goat, papaya ‘test positive’ for coronavirus</strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Tanzania seems to be having a problem with its animals, its coronavirus testing or its leadership amid a bizarre scandal playing out in the African nation.<br>
<br>
President John Magufuli has cast doubt on the country’s coronavirus testing process after he allegedly submitted secret samples from invalid subjects, including a goat and a papaya (yes, the fruit), that came back as “positive” for the virus.<br>
<br>
Magufuli suspended the head of testing at Tanzania’s national health laboratory in response to the alleged errors on Monday, one day after revealing that he had flooded the lab with a variety of samples from things the virus shouldn’t be able to infect.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Magufuli, who has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus, claimed on Sunday that he put human names and ages on several samples taken from non-human subjects. He says the lab came back with positive test results for a papaya, a quail and a goat — three things that have never been linked to the virus in the past.<br>
<br>
Magufuli claimed that there is a “dirty game” going on at the laboratory, and announced that his security forces would be investigating the test kits. He did not say where the lab got its kits.<br>
<br>
“The equipment or people may be compromised and sometimes it can be sabotage,” Magufuli said in a speech to the nation, which was broadcast through the country’s state-run news outlet.</span></div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">Tanzania Kicks Out WHO After Goat &amp; Papaya Samples Came COVID-19 Positive</strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>With the rise in false Coronavirus cases, the Tanzanian President John Magufuli growing suspicious of the World Health Organization (WHO), decided to investigate the claims himself. He sent the WHO samples of a goat, a papaya and a quail for testing. After all 3 samples came COVID-19 positive, the President is reported to have kicked out the WHO from the country.<br>
<br>
UPDATE: Days after Tanzanian move, now Burundi kicks out WHO Coronavirus Team from the country for interference in internal matters. Meanwhile, in yet another African nation Nigeria, Bill Gates has been caught bribing forced Coronavirus program. Just couple of days later, an Italian politician has demanded the arrest of Bill Gates in the Italian parliament. Sara Cunial, the Member of Parliament for Rome denounced Bill Gates as a “vaccine criminal” and urged the Italian President to hand him over to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. She also exposed Bill Gates’ agenda in India and Africa, along with the plans to chip the human race through the digital identification program ID2020.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in a shocking development the President of Madagascar has made a sensational claim that the WHO offered $20m bribe to poison COVID-19 cure. Looks like WHO’s days in Africa are over.</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">President Magufuli warns Tanzanians against Covid-19 vaccines</strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Tanzanian President John Magufuli has warned the country’s health ministry against rushing into embracing the Covid-19 vaccines promoted by foreign companies and countries.<br>
<br>
Magufuli cast doubt on the global urge to develop Covid-19 vaccine claiming that little has been done to help cure other diseases like tuberculosis, HIV-Aids, malaria among other infections.<br>
<br>
“You should stand firm. Vaccinations are dangerous. If the white man was able to come up with vaccinations, he should have found a vaccination for Aids by now; he would have found a vaccination of tuberculosis by now; he would have found a vaccination for malaria by now; he would have found a vaccination for cancer by now,” he said.<br>
<br>
“The Health ministry must know that not every vaccination is meaningful to our nation. Tanzanians must be mindful so that we are not used for trials of some doubtful vaccinations which can have serious repercussions on our health,” he added.<br>
<br>
Little is known in Tanzania on the number of positive cases due to the government's stun position on the virus.<br>
<br>
Tanzania's President John Pombe Magufuli had declared the East African country as Covid-free and did not place any curfew or confinement to prevent the spread of Coronavirus.<br>
<br>
“We have lived for over one year without the virus because our God is able and Satan will always fail. The Health ministry should be cautious, and avoid the temptation to turn us into a country where vaccination trials are conducted freely,” he said.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">“In a certain country, its girl children – aged below 14 years – were vaccinated against what was said to be cervical cancer, but it later emerged that the vaccination was meant to make them infertile,” Dr. Magufuli said.</span></div></blockquote>

The mystery of Tanzania's missing president<br>
</strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>DAR ES SALAAM - Where is Tanzania's President John Magufuli?<br>
<br>
Tuesday marks 17 days since the 61-year-old has been seen in public, and despite a clamour of rumours of ill-health, the Tanzanian authorities have yet to provide clear answers as to his whereabouts.<br>
<br>
The mere question is now leading to arrests, as the government seeks to contain the rumours. <br>
<br>
And analysts say the silence is telling.<br>
<br>
"I think whatever happens ... it is clearly true the regime is trying to buy time," said Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham.<br>
<br>
"And it only really makes sense that the regime is trying to buy time if the president is very ill, incapacitated, or dead." <br>
<br>
Magufuli last appeared in public on February 27, and the fervent Catholic has missed three Sunday services, where he would often address the congregation.<br>
<br>
Just days before, Finance Minister Philip Mpango appeared coughing and gasping at a press conference outside a hospital, to dispel rumours he had died of Covid-19.<br>
<br>
- Fended off by prayer -<br>
<br>
Magufuli's absence comes amid a string of high-profile deaths and illnesses attributed to "respiratory problems" or "pneumonia".<br>
<br>
Magufuli had for months insisted the virus no longer existed in Tanzania, and had been fended off by prayer. He refused to wear a face-mask or take lockdown measures.<br>
<br>
The country stopped releasing case data in April 2020.<br>
<br>
But a week before he was last seen, Magufuli conceded the virus was still circulating, after the vice-president of semi-autonomous Zanzibar was revealed to have died of Covid-19.<br>
<br>
Last Tuesday, main opposition leader Tundu Lissu, exiled in Belgium, and others began questioning Magufuli's absence, citing sources that he was gravely ill from Covid-19, exacerbated by underlying health conditions.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, one of Africa’s most prominent Covid-19 deniers, has died after a two-week absence from public life that prompted speculation that he had contracted the disease.<br>
<br>
Magufuli’s death was announced on Wednesday by the country’s vice-president, Samia Suluhu, who said the president died of heart failure. He was 61.<br>
<br>
“The president of the United Republic of Tanzania, the honourable Dr John Pombe Joseph Magufuli … [has] died of a heart condition, at hospital Mzena in Dar es Salaam, where he was receiving treatment,” she said on state broadcaster TBC.
