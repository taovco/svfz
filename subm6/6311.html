MEZVINSKY was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up attending a Conservative Jewish synagogue.[2] His parents are both former Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives. His father is Edward MEZVINSKY (b. 1937), who embezzled more than $10 million from people via both a Ponzi scheme and the advance-fee scams, and was found guilty of fraud in 2001.[3][4][5] His mother is Marjorie Margolies (b. 1942), who was a TV reporter and represented Pennsylvania's 13th District from 1993 to 1995. They declared bankruptcy shortly before MEZVINSKY's conviction, and divorced.[6]<br>

The Clintons’ Haiti Screw-Up, As Told By Hillary’s Emails <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-email-213110" class="postlink">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story ... ail-213110</a><br>
<br>
Chelsea Clinton was blunt in her report, confident the recipients would respect her request in the memo’s introduction to remain an “invisible soldier.” She had first come to the quake zone six days after the disaster with her father and then-fiancé, Mark Mezvinsky. Now she was returning with the medical aid group Partners in Health, whose co-founder, Dr. Paul Farmer, was her father’s deputy in his Office of the UN Special Envoy for Haiti. What she saw profoundly disturbed her.</div></blockquote>

<br>
<br>
***************<br>
Mark Mezvinsky's name comes up in some notes I have. (Includes info related to Clinton Global Initiative and Victor Pinchuk, and Ukraine)<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In December 2008, shortly before Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state, Mr. Clinton released a list of more than 200,000 donors to defuse speculation about conflicts.<br>
Soon after, Mrs. Clinton agreed to keep foundation matters separate from official business, including a pledge to “not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect upon” the foundation without a waiver. The Obama White House had particularly disliked the gatherings of world leaders, academics and business people, called the Clinton Global Initiative, that the foundation was holding overseas. The foundation limited the conferences to domestic locations while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. On Thursday, Mr. Clinton said the gathering in September in New York would be the foundation’s last.<br>
One of the attendees at these conferences speaks to the stickiness of some donor relationships.<br>
Victor Pinchuk, a steel magnate whose father-in-law, Leonid Kuchma, was&nbsp;president of Ukraine from 1994 to 2005, has directed between $10 million and $25 million to the foundation. He has lent his private plane to the Clintons and traveled to Los Angeles in 2011 to attend Mr. Clinton’s star-studded 65th birthday celebration.<br>
Between September 2011 and November 2012, Douglas E. Schoen, a former political consultant for Mr. Clinton, arranged about a dozen meetings with State Department officials on behalf of or with Mr. Pinchuk to discuss the continuing political crisis in Ukraine, according to reports Mr. Schoen filed as a registered lobbyist.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>“I had breakfast with Pinchuk. He will see you at the Brookings lunch,” Melanne Verveer, a Ukrainian-American then working for the State Department, wrote in a June 2012 email to Mrs. Clinton.&nbsp;<br>
A previously undisclosed email obtained by Citizens United, the conservative advocacy group, through public records lawsuits shows the name of Mr. Pinchuk, described as one of Ukraine’s “most successful businessmen,” among those on an eight-page list of influential people invited to a dinner party at the Clintons’ home.</div></blockquote>


<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics"><span style="color:#FF4000">Earlier in 2012, Ambassador John F. Tefft wrote to Mrs. Clinton about a visit to Ukraine by Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, “at the invitation of oligarch, Victor Pinchuk.” Mrs. Clinton replied, “As you know, hearing nice things about your children is as good as it gets.”</span></em></strong></div></blockquote>


<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In July 2013, the Commerce Department began investigating complaints that Ukraine — and by extension Mr. Pinchuk’s company, Interpipe — and eight other countries had illegally dumped a type of steel tube on the American market at artificially low prices.<br>
A representative for Mr. Pinchuk said the investigation had nothing to do with the State Department, had started after Mrs. Clinton’s tenure and been suspended in July 2014. He added that at least 100 other people had attended the dinner party at Mrs. Clinton’s house and that she and Mr. Pinchuk had spoken briefly about democracy in Ukraine.<br>
A deal involving the sale of American uranium holdings to a Russian state-owned enterprise was another example of the foundation intersecting with Mrs. Clinton’s official role in the Obama administration. Her State Department was among the agencies that signed off on the deal, which involved major Clinton charitable backers from Canada.<br>
There was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton had exerted influence over the deal, but the timing of the transaction and the donations raised questions about whether the donors had received favorable handling.<br>
Even if Mr. Clinton steps down, there could be remaining complications about a potential president’s name being affixed to an international foundation. And Chelsea Clinton, who is its vice chairwoman, would continue her leadership role.<br>
“It is very difficult to see how the organization called the Clinton Foundation can continue to exist during a Clinton presidency without that posing all sorts of consequences,” said John Wonderlich, the interim executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group in Washington. “What they announced only addresses the most egregious potential conflicts.”&nbsp;<br>

I was wondering if we should create a subverse for specific corruption topics, such as Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, as there is so much info in it would overwhelm PG (not for the first time) I don't know- it's tough to see the bigger picture at times when the picture is so massive.  <br>
<br>
All I know is at the end of the day is that <span style="color:#FF0000">Madelaine Albright</span> shows up time and again when you move closer to the top players of global influence for world government.   <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> I laugh but I'm serious.  <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Edward “Ed” Mezvinsky, a former Democratic congressman who represented Iowa’s 1st congressional district from 1973-1977.<br>
<br>
More significantly, he sat on the House Judiciary Committee and voted for all three articles of impeachment against former president Richard Nixon. In 1974, TIME reported Mezvinsky saying that Nixon should be held “to account for the gross abuse of office.”<br>
<br>
At the same time, the then 27-year-old Hillary Clinton got herself hired and fired by the same Judiciary Committee. According to Jerry Zeifman, a long-time Democrat and 17-year-long congressional staffer who supervised Hillary: 
<ul><li>“Because She Was A Liar. She Was An Unethical, Dishonest Lawyer. She Conspired To Violate The Constitution, The Rules Of The House, The Rules Of The Committee And The Rules Of Confidentiality.”</li></ul> <br>
 Hillary was fired for lying to her superior, and for her unethical behavior in conspiring to deny legal counsel to Richard Nixon during the hearings.</div></blockquote> Note that the claim for Hillary being fired is disputed here <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/oct/22/blog-posting/no-hillary-clinton-wasnt-fired-during-watergate-in/" class="postlink">https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2 ... ergate-in/</a><br>
