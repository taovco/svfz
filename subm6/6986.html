Child sex on Goa beaches.</div></blockquote>

Goa is popular with the Jewish Mafia, Israeli soldiers, Israeli tourists, drugs traffickers and child sex traffickers.<br>
In June 2013 it was reported that 'a Mr Ricky Dearman' and 'a Russian woman' were involved in a violent incident in Goa in India. In the Baga - Calangute area of Goa, "two shots were fired from a pistol during a fight between a hotel owner and his relatives, on one side, and a group of taxi drivers and others."<br>
<br>

"Traffic policemen were in the process of towing away a two-wheeler... A Russian woman, who had parked the two-wheeler (motorcycle), objected... "Ricky Dearman, an English tourist whose sister is married to the owner of a resort in the vicinity, intervened... "The police released the vehicle and allowed the Russian to take it away.<br>
<br>
"This angered a group of taxi drivers ... who claimed the cops were lenient towards foreigners."An argument ensued between Ricky and the taxi drivers, allegedly leading to a scuffle. Ricky then phoned his sister and her husband..."Ricky's brother-in-law, Savio Valles, the owner of the Linda Goa resort in the vicinity, reached the spot along with wife, Lisa, around 12.10am. "He was armed with his licensed pistol... He then fired a warning shot in the air and another shot in the direction of the taxi drivers..."While Savio and his relatives took shelter inside the hotel, the group ransacked the front of the hotel...<br>
<br>
"Police reinforcements ... brought the situation under control..." Ricky Dearman Valles is originally from Rotherham in England. On her Facebook page, Lisa Dearman Valles lists two Groups, one of which is the Red Lion in Rotherham.<br>

Britain Condemns Leaders in Town of Rotherham for Ignoring Child Sex Abuse Ring - The New York Times<br>
<br>
Feb 4, 2015 - A report by the British government found a culture of cover-ups and bullying that allowed a sexual abuse ring to exist from 1997 to 2013.<br>
<br>
Before the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, the American organiser of the attacks, David Headley, is believed to have maintained contact with the Mossad station in Goa.<br>
MOSSAD STILL FRIENDS WITH RAW / MOSSAD IN INDIA <a href="https://archive.md/hhedW" class="postlink">https://archive.md/hhedW</a><br>
<br>
For 20 years, Dr Freddy Peats ran a large children’s home in Goa in India. He acted as a social worker with the Catholic church. He was a top member of the Lions Club. A small boy who used to visit Peat’s children’s home told his father that Peats had injected something into his testicles. The father contacted the police. In April 1991, the police raided Peats’ residence and discovered narcotics and a huge collection of sadistic hardcore child porn...<br>
<br>
..Peats was part of an international child abuse ring. This ring supplied children and porn to child abusers worldwide. Some children were kidnapped. Hundreds of children were 'spirited away' from India by Peats’ associates. The ring is believed to have links to the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) in the UK, the Paedo Alert Network (Pan) in Holland, the Lewis Carroll Collectors’ Guild, the Childhood Sensuality Circle and the North American Man-Boy Lovers’ Association (NAMBLA)...<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Duncan Grant who was jailed in India for six years in 2006 for sexual abuse. He had set up Anchorage shelters for street children in Bombay, where the abuse took place. He is a former Royal Naval Reserve officer and the grandson of Maj-Gen Sir Philip Grant. </em><a href="https://archive.md/9m80n" class="postlink">https://archive.md/9m80n</a><br>

<br>
It appears that neither the police nor the local government of Goa wanted to prosecute Peats. However, a Mumbai-based child rights activist called Sheela Barse campaigned to have Peats brought to court. In 1996 Peats went to jail and that was where he died. But most of his associates have been allowed to escape. Peats' associates were from the UK, New Zealand, France, Australia, Sweden, Germany…<br>

Roy Fernandes, one of Peats' victims said: "I was with (Peats) from the end of 1975 till 1984, nine years.<br>
<br>
Fernandes says: "Peats used to send photos to his friends. To Holland, to Germany, to France…. They used to send him money. Foreigners used to come here… They took … some of them… abroad."<br>

Highgate School is applying to build a bunker underneath a playing field to store weapons for its cadet force to use on the school’s existing rifle range.<br>

Heavy security measures, including nightly and weekend patrols, would guard the armoury off Bishopswood Road, Highgate, as required by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), which has given the proposals the green light...
