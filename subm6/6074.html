<a href="https://archive.ph/nIvdp" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/nIvdp</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tina Kotek is stepping down from her long-held roles as Speaker of the House and state representative in the <br>
Oregon Legislature, her office announced.Kotek served as Speaker for nine years, making her the longest-serving Speaker in Oregon's history, according to her office. Additionally, she became the first openly lesbian Speaker of <br>
any state house in the U.S. in 2013. She steps down from her role as state representative for House District 44, <br>
which covers North and Northeast Portland. Her final day in office will be, January 21. <br>
<br>
Kotek said she's decided to step down before the upcoming session in order to focus her attention <br>
on the people of Oregon as a whole. <br>
<br>
“Serving as Speaker of the House and representing my community in the legislature has been an amazing honor, and I am forever grateful to my constituents, my colleagues, and the entire state for the opportunity to serve. After considerable reflection, I have decided to step down from the legislature before the upcoming session. I have spent the past few months working hard with my colleagues to set a session agenda that includes essential investments in the services Oregonians need and paves a path forward on important issues for workers, our natural resources, and economic growth. I have faith in my colleagues to get everything over the finish line next month.<br>
<br>
“As for my nine years as Speaker, I am proud of the historic accomplishments the legislature has delivered for Oregonians, and I leave the role knowing that our efforts will benefit Oregonians now and well into the future.<br>
 Having achieved these victories as Speaker, I am shifting my attention to ensure that they are implemented in<br>
 ways that improve the lives of people in every corner of Oregon.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Last year, Kotek announced her run for Oregon's governor, a race that could go to anyone. Kotek's departure from<br>
 the Oregon Legislature comes a day after another long-standing figure in state politics announced his retirement. Sen. Peter Courtney, a Democratic Oregon state legislator and powerful dealmaker at the Capitol, announced Wednesday to colleagues that he will serve out the rest of his term and not seek reelection.<br>
<br>
Courtney shared the following statement on Kotek's departure: <br>
“Tina will always be a historic figure in the Legislature. To be Speaker for 10 years in the House is extremely <br>
difficult. She is very good at many things. She is excellent with budgets. ......”<br>
<br>
<br>
Oregon House Speaker, Senate President accused of sexual harassment cover-up by fellow Democrat<br>
Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian took the step Wednesday of filing a complaint with his own agency to accuse Senate President Peter Courtney and House Speaker Tina Kotek, who are fellow Democrats, of covering up a pervasive culture of sexual harassment at the Capitol.<br>
<br>
In his complaint, Avakian charged that Courtney and Kotek, the Legislature’s top officers, knew or should have known about complaints from women about then-Sen. Jeff Kruse, R-Roseburg, and the “broader sexually hostile environment in the Capitol.”<br>
<br>
Avakian also charges other powerful Capitol figures, including top legislative lawyer Dexter Johnson and human resources chief Lore Christopher, of admonishing women not to tell anyone about sexual harassment by Kruse, <br>
a top Courtney staffer and another unnamed man, and falsely telling victims of harassment that they did not <br>
have standing to sue.<br>
Kruse has since resigned over his conduct.<br>
Avakian alleges in his complaint that, despite complaints by women about Kruse, Courtney and Kotek did "did not take immediate and appropriate action to correct his conduct." The complaint, submitted by Avakian under penalty of perjury, was first reported by Oregon Public Broadcasting and independently obtained by The Oregonian/OregonLive.<br>
<br>
A memo signed by Courtney and Kotek dated Wednesday states the Legislature "will participate transparently" in <br>
any subsequent investigation.<br>
<br>
"We welcome additional scrutiny and a thorough investigation related to the commissioner's complaint," said the memo, given by Kotek's office to The Oregonian/OregonLive.<br>
<br>
Kotek said in a text message Wednesday that she did not disregard complaints of harassment.<br>
<br>
“As a woman and as a person in a position of leadership I have absolutely taken every complaint that was brought to my attention seriously,” the House speaker said.<br>
<br>
Courtney, said he takes "every complaint seriously" and encouraged others with complaints to come forward.<br>
Kruse resigned in March after news reports and the outside investigation revealed he subjected as many as 15 <br>
women working at the Capitol to years of sexual harassment despite repeated warnings. At least two female state senators, a lobbyist and two female interns were among the complainants.<br>
<br>
Avakian’s filing alleges that Johnson, the legislative counsel, and Dian Rubanoff, the attorney hired to investigate Kruse, protected Kruse and another unnamed harasser by advising victims not to speak about the incidents or telling them they had no legal recourse.<br>
<br>
Avakian also charges that Johnson brokered an “informal settlement” to protect Courtney aide Robin Maxey, who<br>
 was accused by a female employee of sexual harassment. As part of the settlement, the woman would keep away from Maxey and would not speak about the alleged harassment, Avakian’s filing states. <br>
<br>
Johnson also downplayed allegations of harassment against two other male lawmakers, the complaint says, by declaring the conduct they were accused of as minor or an outright fabrication. Johnson was unavailable for comment Wednesday.<br>
<br>
Following the investigation of Kruse, Avakian requested Kotek and Courtney’s office forward a letter to the two interns and the lobbyist advising them of their legal rights. The legislative leaders agreed to send the letter, but <br>
later refused, Avakian wrote.<br>
<br>
Upon request from The Oregonian/OregonLive, Kotek's office provided documents showing she and Courtney advised Johnson the week after receiving Avakian's letter to "immediately make contact" with the harassment victims to inform them of their right to sue.<br>
<br>
Rubanoff, the investigator, sent the victims a letter on behalf of the Legislature about two weeks later. It shows the Legislature took steps to follow Avakian's suggestion that victims be notified they are protected by law from harassment and be apprised of their right to sue or file a state or federal labor complaint.<br>
<br>
Rubanoff's letter went so far as to advise the victims of statute of limitations deadlines. Despite that, the June 8 letter was sent to the victims too late and the timelines for filing a lawsuit notice or labor complaint had elapsed, according to Avakian's filing.<br>
<br>
Avakian eventually sent his original letter to the students by another method, and they contacted his office for assistance. They reported feeling “distress at being misled” by Rubanoff about their rights to legal recourse, the complaint said. The students feared that “their careers in public service would be over if they came forward,” the complaint said.<br>
<br>

<br>
Avakian declined an interview Wednesday. By having Avakian file the complaint, the victims may remain unnamed – the same procedure Avakian used before to launch an investigation of former state Sen. John Minnis, who was accused of sexual harassment by a woman who worked for him when he directed a state public safety agency.<br>
<br>
In response to Avakian’s new complaint, the Bureau of Labor and Industries will conduct an investigation and may “redress harms” that occurred, his statement said. The bureau’s deputy director will decide on the merits of Avakian’s accusations.<br>
<br>
It is unusual for Avakian, as a Democrat, to go public with such explosive allegations against fellow Democrats. He lost in his bid to become secretary of state in 2016 to Dennis Richardson, a Republican. Avakian won the Democratic primary that year against Val Hoyle, who in 2018 won her bid to succeed Avakian as labor commissioner.<br>
<br>
Though he has announced he will not seek another term Avakian, has not made public what he plans to do after he leaves office in January.<br>
