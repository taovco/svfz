Virologist and Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Wed Feb 9, 2022 - 8:00 pm EST<br>
<br>
PARIS (LifeSiteNews) — Dr. Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Prize winning biologist and virologist who sounded alarms regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus, experimental vaccine campaigns, and the “indefensible” mandates for their reception, died yesterday at age 89.<br>
<br>
As reported by FranceSoir, the scientist and professor passed away in peace at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine “surrounded by his children.”<br>
<br>
Montagnier is best known for his discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for which he was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Throughout his career, he worked in a variety of distinguished research and lecturing capacities at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, Queens College in New York, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, and the French National Centre for Scientific Research. He was also the recipient of dozens of awards — including the Hippocrates Award of the Hellenic Society for Internal Medicine — and 13 honorary doctorate degrees.<br>
<br>
In the last two years, Montagnier made headlines challenging the dominant government and media narrative regarding the novel coronavirus and the massive experimental gene-based vaccines being imposed across the world as a response.<br>
<br>
In April 2020, he came out and asserted that the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus indicated that it was the result of human manipulation and was released from the Wuhan laboratory. After facing enormous ridicule from social media “fact-checkers,” including the theory’s being labeled as “false” for over a year, evidence began to surface in May 2021 that, indeed, this assessment was correct.<br>
<br>
In fact, in June, emails obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request emerged that colleagues of White House medical czar Dr. Anthony Fauci had informed him the previous year about “unusual features” of the virus that pointed to a possible man-made origin, just prior to his public statements downplaying this assertion, until in May 2021 he acknowledged it may have validity.<br>
<br>
Also in the spring of 2021, before the appearance of the Delta variant, Montagnier granted an interview where he called the campaign of mass vaccination against the coronavirus during the pandemic “unthinkable” and a historical blunder that is “creating the variants” and leading to deaths from the disease.<br>
<br>
“It’s an enormous mistake, isn’t it? A scientific error as well as a medical error. It is an unacceptable mistake,” he said. “The history books will show that, because it is the vaccination that is creating the variants.”<br>
<br>
And, finally, just last month, as the U.S. Supreme Court was in recess considering challenges to the Biden administration’s experimental COVID-19 injection mandates, Montagnier wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal with Yale law professor Jed Rubenfeld, declaring that the Omicron variant had made all such “vaccine” requirements “legally indefensible and contrary to the public interest.”<br>
<br>
The Supreme Court decided to block Biden’s business vaccine mandate but allowed these requirements for government healthcare providers.<br>
<br>
FranceSoir concluded that despite the significant criticism the French virologist endured in the autumn of his life, due to these interventions, he was always committed to the principles of free scientific inquiry and communication for which the publication expressed gratitude.</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">Nobel laureate in medicine Luc Montagnier has died at the age of 89. The French virologist was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2008 for his discovery of the HIV virus. </strong><br>
<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The news of his death was broadcast by the French News Agency, citing the mayor of the French city of Neuilly-sur-Seine. The relevant news was preceded by the French magazine France Soir, without however being confirmed by the family of the deceased. <br>
<br>
The news was confirmed by the French geneticist Alexandra Henrion-Caude, a colleague of the professor, who also made a relevant post on Twitter<br>
<br>
The award-winning scientist had worked in many scientific institutes. He has been an emeritus director of research at CNRS, a professor at the Pasteur Institute, director of the Center for Molecular and Cell Biology at Queens College, New York City University, and director of research institute at Jiao-tong University in Shanghai. He also supported through his research the Academy of Sciences, but also the National Academy of Medicine. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Lately it has been one of the most well-known voices that have spoken out against the Covid vaccine, warning of the activation of serious side effects in the human body. </strong><br>

<br>
Vaccination during a pandemic is unthinkable and causes death, said the winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2008. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"></strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div>    <strong class="text-strong">“The new strains are the result of vaccination. “You can see in every country, it is the same thing: in every country, after vaccination, there are deaths ,” the French virologist said.</strong></div></blockquote><br>
<br>
Despite his advanced age, he took part in demonstrations against the compulsory Covid vaccination and a month ago spoke in the Luxembourg Parliament on this topic. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong">Luc Montagnier’s last public speech: It is a crime to give these vaccines to our children</strong></span><br>
<br>
In a large rally held in Milan, Italy against the mandatory vaccination measures, Luc Montagnier stressed in his speech:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">    “And this vaccine does not protect at all, it is recognized by the whole world, in fact it favors other infections. The viral protein used for the mRNA in the vaccine is toxic to the cells. It is a poison. There are many dead and many young athletes who have heart problems due to the vaccine! Many young athletes have died as a result of their vaccination. Vaccines should not kill but protect. “It is an absolute crime to give these vaccines to children.”</strong></div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">The appeal of Luc Montagnier: ‘Let’s stop mass vaccination immediately’</strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It was perhaps the most important Saturday of demonstrations since the protests began throughout Europe. During a huge event organized by the political opposition in Italy, the squares in Rome and Milan were filled to maximum capacity.<br>
<br>
Published: January 18, 2022, 10:23<br>
<br>
An important event organized by Per l’Italia with Paragone-Italexit took place from 3 to 6 pm in Milan in Piazza XXV Aprile: The demo for the defense of constitutional rights and against the management of the government’s health policy and Green Pass. There were several guests who attended the protest, but the most awaited guest was undoubtedly the Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier.<a href="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/" class="postlink">https://platform.twitter.com/embed/</a><br>
<br>
Below is the transcript of Luc Montagnier’s speech in Milan:<br>
<br>
‘There are images, also extraordinary for me, of small bacteria even in the intestine, which are full of viruses. And this is a battle between bacteria and viruses, which must be defeated even with proper nutrition and hygiene. It is not the vaccine that cures, but the combination of medicines that will eliminate this disease.<br>
<br>
There was a huge strategic mistake, something was synthesized and isolated, a huge strategic mistake. Contrary to what was said at the beginning, these vaccines offer no protection, and this is emerging slowly. This is scientifically recognized by all today. It is not only scientific experiments that show it, but also all patients on whom the effects have been analyzed to prove it.<br>
<br>
Instead of protecting as was promised, it can instead promote other infections. The protein that was used in vaccines for this virus is actually toxic, it is a poison. A vaccine should not be killing but protecting and there have been many deaths, even young sportsmen who have important problems, due to this vaccine. It is an absolute crime to give these vaccines to children today.<br>
<br>
It can also cause very serious nerve diseases in the brain. Due to the long-term effects of this vaccine, there are a lot of people who are dying. Neurological disorders can also occur from the first dose, and not only from the second. Even today, no one can predict how many of these people who have been vaccinated now will have major neurological problems in the future.<br>
<br>
I ask all my colleagues to absolutely stop vaccinating with this type of vaccine. Doctors today are perfectly informed of what I am saying, and therefore they should intervene immediately because the future of humanity is at stake. Many countries have forgotten about treatments, there is not only the vaccine, there are drugs that have not been used and that work very well, such as antibiotics.<br>
<br>
It is up to you, especially the unvaccinated who one day will be able to save humanity. Only the unvaccinated will be able to save the vaccinated. Vaccinated who will, in any case, contact the medical centers to be saved. We must avoid listening and giving a voice to those who do not have the right to do so and let science speak. I repeat: it is the unvaccinated who will be able to save humanity.<br>
<br>
In the beginning, the large pharmaceutical multinationals were very interested in vaccines for an economic issue. This has now overtaken them and we must return to respect for scientific truth. It is necessary to carefully follow the evolution of the clinical situation, especially of the vaccinated with 1, 2 or 3 doses, because there are scientific studies that concern serious brain diseases. And we need to remove the fog that has hit the scientific news. It is important that medicine and scientific truth appear accurate in the media and in the mainstream.<br>
<br>
Especially for people who have other pathologies, such as cancer for example, it is very important that they are not vaccinated, because there is an aluminum that enters the cells and it is super carcinogenic even more and therefore instead of treating the sick they make them die even sooner. The research continues, and I and my whole team continue to research this virus. The research does not stop, we have not yet reached that point.<br>
<br>
Man will win if he concentrates on the law of nature and only on that. Every citizen is free and must also follow political ideas, take advantage of the upcoming elections to express your opinion.<br>
<br>
What would I say to a young person today? You absolutely must take action, each of you, and find the truth behind the lies. Long live freedom.’</div></blockquote>
