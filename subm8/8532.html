&gt; Farm with roughly 200,000 chickens catches fire in Wright County<br><br>
&gt; The Wright County Sheriff's Office said a poultry building on the farm, with about 200,000 chickens inside, was damaged in a fire on Saturday night.<br><br>
This happened in a town I used to go to. There's fires popping up in food producing facilities all over the country. One autistic hero tallied them all up, and it paints an alarming picture. <br><br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/4bqy7c.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>200,000 hens confirmed destroyed so far<br>
Fire started at 10PM on Saturday night<br>
Entire facility shut down for the foreseeable future<br><br>
This comes one month after one of the WORLDS largest egg farms owned by a jewish billionaire destroyed 5,300,000 hens and then fired everyone at the egg factory<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220428090643/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/28/egg-factory-avian-flu-chickens-culled-workers-fired-iowa" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20220428090 ... fired-iowa</a><br><br>
&gt;According to Forsman Farms website, the farm started in 1918, and now the fourth-generation family farm sells more than three million eggs a day to some of the nation’s largest retailers.<br>
&gt;“It was unbelievable how quick it grew, it was insane,” Andy Trebesch said. “It was the whole sky, it was quite large.”<br>
&gt;A barn housing tens of thousands of chickens was leveled, in what a farm spokesperson called a “tragic accident.”<br><br>

The plan is to manufacture a famine/food shortage coupled with hyperinflation. This will create an excuse for food rationing. A digital identity will be mandated to receive rations as to prevent people from receiving more than allotted. With a digital identity in place a digital currency will follow. All purchases will be tracked, taxed and some may even be prohibited.</div></blockquote>

This is after I was already following a thread on it from almost a month ago: <br><br><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/376225012" class="postlink">http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/376225012</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>5 days ago I started nooooticing those images and lists floating around that show large scale industrial size food processing plants being burned down or sabotaged. I quickly nooooticed that every thread and every image was just a repeat of the same 20 or so facilities<br>
4 days ago through the power of autism I began meticulously cataloguing and archiving every single instance of a major fire or incident at industrial size food processing plants, large farms, grain/cereal processing centers, and large warehouses that store fertilizer, ag related chemicals and large farming equipment going back to january 1st 2019<br><br>
I have now caught up and finished the incidents for 2022 and have finished and double checked 10 out of 12 months of 2021<br>
2020 is more than halfway finished<br>
2019 still needs some work<br>
even in this unfinished state you can see a clear pattern and escalation of incidents in 2022<br><br>
Link to spreadsheet: <a href="https://ufile.io/8joihfrq" class="postlink">https://ufile.io/8joihfrq</a><br><br>
an example of the size of the facilities in my list: the Tyson facility from 2019 was equal to 5% of all slaughtered cattle in the country by itself and its indefinite closure immediately increased the price of beef nationwide.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Now I will begin listing every single incident I have archived and catalogued in my spreadsheet starting with the tags I have decided to use to separate the incidents and their definitions:<br><br>
TAGS:<br><br>
DESTROYED CATTLE/POULTRY/HOGS - Recalls, destroyed birds, cattle, hogs from a facility that is not a PROCESSING FACILITY.<br><br>
GRAIN SILO FIRE - Fires, elevator malfunctions, other disasters that burn down and/or disable facilities involved in the storing and processing of grain/cereals, such as; soeybeans, wheat, barley, etc.<br><br>
[COMPANY NAME] FOOD PROCESSING PLANT - Food processing plants that take the poultry, beef, pork and turn into processed foods and/or meat packing plants/slaughter houses that take live animals and turn them into raw food or partially cooked foods.<br><br>
WAREHOUSE FIRE - Fires that burn down warehouses that store fertilizer, ag related chemicals and equipment.<br><br>
HECTARES LOST - When large (thousands of acres) worth of land is lost in some kind of fire or other disaster or government policy.<br><br>
