			<div class="content">A 2012 study of 20 cases of pedophiles who committed suicide<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Methods<br>
The public record (hard and electronic copy) was searched, cases were documented, and a summary made. We have an extensive collection of newspaper reports of suicide covering the last 32 years, and employed electronic search methods using the words “suicide”, “pedophilia” and “suicide child sex offence”. The summary took the form of a table and simple calculations.</div></blockquote>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629679/" class="postlink">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629679/</a><br><br>
I wasn't going to go into the study (it looks for mental illness which they didn't really find).  The case studies are of interest though... prominent professions, the length of offending.  Violent offenders were excluded from the study.  There's a paragraph with details of each subject some of which I won't include in my recap of jobs and length of offending as it's easy enough to read that part of study.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Lewis Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt (59 years; 1922) ...His father, Sir William, had been Home Secretary. Harcourt married at 33 years and fathered four children. He had been a liberal MP (1904–1916), and had held various ministerial positions, including Secretary of State to the colonies (17).</div></blockquote>
He also has a Port named after him in Nigeria <a href="https://dnbstories.com/2019/02/lewis-vernon-harcourt-the-man-port-harcourt-was-named-after.html" class="postlink">https://dnbstories.com/2019/02/lewis-ve ... after.html</a><br><br><span style="color:#FF0000"></span><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0000">Neil Hocquart (40 years; 1991) was a photographer associated with Nichols Rabet (see later) and a large group of other pedophiles at a privately funded children’s activity center, “The Stables”. He died of a drug overdose in London, after police raided his house and confiscated 300 pornographic videos and 100 pornographic photographs. Hocquart, born Foster, took the name from a Guernsey sailor. Captain Hocquart willed considerable wealth to Foster, and soon after, died of an apparent heart attack. At this time, Rabet fled to Thailand (18).</span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>William Lucan-Roberts (61 years; 2000), was facing 67 child sex charges...was a classics teacher and cricket coach at a prestigious Sydney secondary school (19).<br><br>
William Brown (52 years; 2004)...He had once worked in the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. However, “his overt homosexuality had led to his dismissal as a diplomat” in 1984. He then worked as an English teacher in a tourism school in Bali (20).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Bruce Crosby (59 years; 2006) was an educated US citizen living in Panama. ...believed to have been an active pedophile, using local boys, and made a living by selling pornography and arranging pedophile sex tours of Panama to clients from around the world (21).<br><br>
Louis Conradt (56 years; 2006) had been Texas district attorney for more than 20 years and at the time of his death he was Rockwall County chief felony assistant district attorney. ...Conradt graduated in law from the University of Texas, and lived alone (22).<br><br>
Wolfgang Priklopil (44 years; 2006) abducted 10-year-old school girl, Natasha Kampusch, near Vienna, in 1998. He kept her prisoner in the basement of his house for 8 years. When she escaped and the police were alerted, Priklopil suicided by jumping in front of a train.... Priklopil was a communication technician with a good work history. He owned his own house (which he inherited from his grandfather) and a luxury car (23).<br><br><span style="color:#FF0000">Nichols Rabet (57 years; 2006) handcuffed his hands to his ankles, taped a plastic bag over his head and died of suffocation, in Pattaya, Thailand, days before he was to appear in court on multiple pedophile offences, including sex acts with children as young as six years. He had been on bail for 10 months. Rabet was a British citizen. He had been the deputy head of a council run children’s home in London but left after being accused of child molestation. His name was placed on a register of people deemed unsuitable to work with children. He then financed and operated a children’s activity center in Sussex, called ‘The Stables’ (his money was left to him by an elderly woman he had befriended-events similar to those by which his colleague, Neil Hocquart, came into money). Rabet fled to Thailand in the 1980s, when accused of molestation of children. His suicide note read: “Sorry I have to leave like this but it is the only way to escape the stress of my life” (24).</span> see more info <a href="https://islingtonsurvivors.co.uk/nicholas-rabet/" class="postlink">https://islingtonsurvivors.co.uk/nicholas-rabet/</a> </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> J D “Roy” Atchison, (53 years; 2007) was an assistant United States prosecutor living in Florida. He was married to a school teacher and had three children. Atchison was president of the Gulf Breeze Sports Association for soccer, t-ball and other activities. He was snared in a police operation and charged with traveling from Florida to Michigan to have sex with a 5-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty. ... (25). </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Helmet Nehls (64 years; 2007) was being held in gaol in Udon Thani (Thailand). He had been arrested and charged with having abducted and raped a 12 year old girl, a crime punishable by life in prison. He stuffed socks in his mouth, cut his wrists and died in custody. Nehls was a computer technician, a German national, from Zeppernick, East Germany. He had frequently visited Thailand over a period of 15 years and was fluent in the language. Police claimed he was in the habit of paying families to have the use of pre-pubescent children for weekends, and produced pornographic material which they found at his home (26).<br><br>
Bob Collins (61 years; 2007) died of an overdose of medication and alcohol in Northern Territory, Australia, following a battle with bowel cancer, and three days before he was to face a committal hearing on 21 charges of sex with children dating back 30 years. Other charges were in preparation, including possession of child pornography images. Collins lived a high profile political life. At 35 years of age, he became a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. At 41 years, he was elected to the Australian Senate and was soon elevated to the Cabinet. His party lost power in 1996, and Collins retired from parliament two years later, at 52 years of age. He then held senior government positions, until he was charged with child-sex offences. He had received a civil decoration for his community work (27).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Elliott Lash (26 years; 2009) was a pediatric nurse who jumped to his death from the 4th floor of a building in Nashville, Tennessee. His wife had discovered pictures on his computer, of him molesting a male child... The police confiscated three of his computers and a large quantity of videos and still photographs. Lash was married (but recently separated) and had four children. He was a Navy veteran and had spent a short period at Austin Peay State University (28).<br><br>
David Dewees (32 years; 2009) had been teaching English and Latin at Jarvis Collegiate Institute (Toronto, Canada) for six years.

William Evans (57 years; 2009) was charged with sexual offences claimed to have been committed against a young female nearly 30 years previously. Minutes before he was found not guilty on technical grounds (a statute of limitations issue), Evans, who had not returned to court after the lunch break, shot himself at his Florida home. He had written to the woman apologizing for his actions 8 years before he died. He had been supported in court by his wife, daughter, son-inlaw and brother (30).<br><br>
Ivan Bennett (64 years; 2010) hanged himself in jail in Nevada while awaiting a court appearance on charges of possessing child pornography. He had been convicted seven years earlier for possession of child pornography and eighteen years earlier for molestation of a child. Bennett had served 22 years in the US Army and was married with three children (31).<br><br>
Richard Dyde (47 years; 2010) was born and gained his first degree in the UK, before emigrating to Canada in 2001. He was arrested on charges of child pornography, arising from Project Sanctuary, a year-long investigation into child pornography which saw 57 men arrested world-wide. ... Dyde was married, held a PhD in neuroscience, and worked as a researcher at York University, Toronto. He was popular, witty and multitalented - he had recently written a biography of the pioneer aviator, George Cayley (32). </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Chad Hunt (42 years; 2011) was a well regarded family man, who had been employed as an athletics coach at the Clear Creek High School (League City, Texas) for 5 years. He was interviewed by police due to an allegation of “improper contact” with a young (16 year old) female, and placed on administrative leave by his employer...The police found that he did not appear to be emotionally unstable. Before the second interview, he shot himself in his car. There were many expressions of sympathy and students and staff have stated that Hunt was popular and will be greatly missed (33).<br><br>
Melvin Levine (71 years; 2011) was a famous pediatrician with a special interest in learning disabilities. His book, “A Mind at a Time”, had been number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and he had frequently appeared on radio and television. ... [The] lawsuit charged that Dr Levine performed unnecessary genital examinations on 40 boys while at Children’s Hospital, Boston from 1966 to 1985 (34).<br><br>
Robert Carlson (68 years; 2011), founder and president of Penobscot Community Health Care, was a married, highly respected figure in the Greater Bangor area. Three days before plunging to his death from a bridge above the Penobscot River, police had commenced investigating an allegation that Reverend Carlson had sexually abused a young boy while he was pastor at East Orrington Congregational Church, a position he had held from the late 1970s for 25 years. Hours before his death, Carlson had met with the alleged victim, now a middle-aged adult living in the area (35).<br><br>
Andrew Bourne (46 years; 2012), married with two children, was a surgeon at Mammoth Lakes Hospital, California. Bourne’s body was found in the region of a fish hatchery near his home in the Eastern Sierra resort area, a fortnight after bail had been posted for alleged sex crimes against a 14 year old girl... (36).<br></div></blockquote></div>
