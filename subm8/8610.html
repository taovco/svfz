<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 2015, drag queens reading in libraries suddenly became a "thing."  While I see these men as grotesque appropriations of womanhood, they were sold as cute, sparkly people who make reading fun.  Once the camel's nose was in the tent, drag queens performing for children started appearing everywhere, not just in libraries, where weird parents intentionally bring their children, but at nightclubs and across schools, where children are captive audiences.  It's become so endemic that Libs of TikTok has put together a seemingly endless thread of such appearances.<br><br>
Back in the early 1990s, some men I knew when I worked in San Francisco performed as part of a Drag Queen a cappella group.  Unlike many of the drag queens parading around today, these guys were actually talented performers, so I enjoyed the first show I attended.  By the second show, though, I'd had enough.  While some songs were clever parodies of pop culture issues, way too many were obsessed with sodomy (in more detail than most people should ever want to know), fecal matter, and STDs.  That's when I realized that people who define themselves by non-traditional (some might say deviant) sexuality tend to obsess over that sexuality and, moreover, seem to have stopped developmentally at the "poo-poo is funny" stage of humor (around three years old).<br><br>
Armed with that knowledge, I've found very disturbing the number of drag queens swarming children's reading rooms.  Were my kids still small, I wouldn't want them under the tutelage of someone whose entire identity revolves around his genitals and what he does with them.  However, when parents objected, they were schooled as "transphobes" and "homophobes," and most backed down.<br><br>
So the drag queens have continued to dig their way into children's lives.  It's not just at libraries.  The big children's entertainment media companies are on board.  Andrew Levitt, an untalented drag performer but highly talented self-promoter, inveigled his way into Nickelodeon, appearing on the children's show Blue's Clues and You and singing about LGBTQ identities in a video aimed at children.  And now Disney+ has Levitt urging little children to celebrate gay pride and drag queens with him.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In addition to reporting on the entertainment media stories, Libs of TikTok suddenly realized that she'd been posting a lot of tweets about drag queens performing for children at libraries, summer camps, nightclubs, and public schools.  (And, almost invariably, the school administrators insisted after the fact that they had no idea what was going on.  Uh-huh.  Sure.)  Libs of TikTok decided that the "drag queens targeting children" phenomenon needed to be explored and embarked on a seemingly endless thread to do so.  Here are just some of the tweets from that thread:</div></blockquote>

They say it’s innocent. They say it’s just about inclusion and acceptance. They say no one is trying to confuse, corrupt, or sexualize kids. They lie. <img alt="🧵" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f9f5.svg"></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Despite their sparkly make-up, drag queens are not wholesome.  They are, as I said, grotesque parodies of real women and, usually, wildly sexualized parodies.  As Matt Walsh has said, you'd never dream of letting young children watch real women dance as these men do.  The fact that they are pretending to be women doesn't make what they're doing any less overtly sexual or abnormal.  Parents need to stop being intimidated by the endless barrage of insults and take a stand against their children being groomed by an endless parade of tawdry (and frequently talentless), self-loathing, and misogynistic men.</div></blockquote>

Nickelodeon continues its LGBT crusade for children<br><br><br>
"In January 2022, Willingham-Jaggers told NBC News that she sees schools as a “breeding ground” for activism.<br>
“LGBTQ+ young people in schools and their student groups, like GSAs, have always been the hub, kind of the breeding ground, the soil from which these sparks of activism come up,” she said. “What we understand is that young people are going to help us understand the vision forward and the way forward to the future.” "<br><br><br>
Mattel is producing the first transgender Barbie with an official Laverne Cox doll.<br>
"It’s a strange marketing point as it’s unclear as to how many young girls identify as 50-year-old transwomen."<br><a href="https://archive.ph/2hxKA#selection-1047.0-1047.109" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/2hxKA#selection-1047.0-1047.109</a><br><br><img src="https://archive.ph/2hxKA/ec0ff8c6f1ca9febd465aff7fae22e0ffca3f337.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><br><img src="https://archive.ph/XnR5M/64c51441f81f407177f4ed09e4f6e9312e89ec05.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div>

Sounds like a good number of the+ community in that age group suffer from mental illness.

Edit: BTW, I didn't mean this as an attack against Americans; there are plenty of aspects about their national ethos I respect (constitutionalism, America-first, 2nd ammendment, small govt., etc.), and my country is certainly not a role model, but we've got to admit that western societies are not waking up to the problem. Jews or no jews, this is on us.</div>

There was, in Utah there were church groups that protested but the (((police))) intervened. There is a heavy federal presence in the western states of the US where land theft is rampant. That's actually where this "movement" started. Property owners grabbed their guns to ward off federal invaders that came over cattle grazing public land. A standoff ensued in which the FBI was BTFO. So they waited and picked the "leader" off when he was alone, then immediately after this "movement" came to town. <br><br>

I think I'm a bit lost. Isn't this a massive trampling of states' autonomy and freedom of thought? Literally federal government enforcing faggot propaganda but BLM riots are totally okay xdd just give up your guns dude</div>

I don't know how Americans allow this to happen to them. There should be a massive outrage, but for some reason people are okay with. Blame it on the jews if you will, but this is on Americans as well.

There was, in Utah there were church groups that protested but the (((police))) intervened. There is a heavy federal presence in the western states of the US where land theft is rampant. That's actually where this "movement" started. Property owners grabbed their guns to ward off federal invaders that came over cattle grazing public land. A standoff ensued in which the FBI was BTFO.

Yes, therein lies the makings of our civil war. Once again the wrong side won.</div>

I'm an outsider, so my opinion is probably not well-informed, but I kind of get the feeling that there won't be a civil war. Things will gradually get worse and there will be less and less chances of resistance. You have to bear in mind that common folk don't start wars; they don't have any reason to do so, nor do they have the means to mobilize armies. It is the higher-ups who do.  Maybe at some point there was a true opposition to this downright evil socialist/progress world government agenda, but I think it is long gone. Perhaps the last battle truly was WW2 and the forces of evil won.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>This is the way the world ends.

I think I'm a bit lost. Isn't this a massive trampling of states' autonomy and freedom of thought? Literally federal government enforcing faggot propaganda but BLM riots are totally okay xdd just give up your guns dude
</div></blockquote>

Yes, therein lies the makings of our civil war. Once again the wrong side won.
</div></blockquote>

I'm an outsider, so my opinion is probably not well-informed, but I kind of get the feeling that there won't be a civil war. Things will gradually get worse and there will be less and less chances of resistance. You have to bear in mind that common folk don't start wars; they don't have any reason to do so, nor do they have the means to mobilize armies. It is the higher-ups who do.  Maybe at some point there was a true opposition to this downright evil socialist/progress world government agenda, but I think it is long gone. Perhaps the last battle truly was WW2 and the forces of evil won.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper.</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>

I'm talking about The American Civil War which happened in the 1860's. It was a conflict between state vs federal powers.</div>

I don't know how Americans allow this to happen to them. There should be a massive outrage, but for some reason people are okay with. Blame it on the jews if you will, but this is on Americans as well.<br><br>
Edit: BTW, I didn't mean this as an attack against Americans; there are plenty of aspects about their national ethos I respect (constitutionalism, America-first, 2nd ammendment, small govt., etc.), and my country is certainly not a role model, but we've got to admit that western societies are not waking up to the problem. Jews or no jews, this is on us.
