			<div class="content">It stemmed from my exposing bitch (((blume))) <br><br><a href="https://consumeproduct.win/p/15HIFP2TsF/ublumen4alles-is-a-self-admitted/" class="postlink">https://consumeproduct.win/p/15HIFP2TsF ... -admitted/</a><br><br>
But I revisited that thread when another conversation brought it up again <br><br><a href="https://consumeproduct.win/p/15IEAPn0GH/x/c/4OYYmYC9v4X" class="postlink">https://consumeproduct.win/p/15IEAPn0GH/x/c/4OYYmYC9v4X</a><br><br>
So I reviewed that thread again, and there's always one that stands out in support of that kike's pedo shit. (((Blume))) even posted about it as if it was some kind of "gotcha". <br><br><a href="https://www.talk.lol/viewpost.php?postid=6243609f95eda" class="postlink">https://www.talk.lol/viewpost.php?postid=6243609f95eda</a><br><br>
So with this new pedo shit coming to light, the one denying it was pedo shit (it's muh fedposters I swear!) BreadBong, I wanted to see what mental gymnastics he would resort to trying to justify it. <br><br>
Original thread: <br><a href="https://consumeproduct.win/p/15HIFP2TsF/x/c/4OVycRk4FwC" class="postlink">https://consumeproduct.win/p/15HIFP2TsF/x/c/4OVycRk4FwC</a><br><br>
The update:<br><a href="https://consumeproduct.win/p/15HIFP2TsF/x/c/4OYYmYB407p" class="postlink">https://consumeproduct.win/p/15HIFP2TsF/x/c/4OYYmYB407p</a><br><br>
So then he wants to hide the conversation and starts PMing me the argument. He didn't realize I am an expert in PilPul tactics, so he tried the ol' "agree but disagree" maneuver: <br><br>
(All times are accurate to the time of this post) <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>
You're not wrong<br>
from BreadBong sent 21 hours ago<br>
Nah I gave you a chance because the fed posting is causing shit to go downhill, and you ended up sperging like dials cat.<br><br>
So I called it like I saw it.<br><br>
Not triggered dipshit.</div></blockquote>

Could have fooled me <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br><br>
Then the dumbass gives himself away as one of the talk.loli crew<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>from BreadBong sent 21 hours ago<br>
No, I'm the one who exposed mikenigger as a fed, and with the help of wiggles when he was an admin that diggernicks was his alt....<br><br>
I'm very good at exposing feds, and I'm starting to take an interest in you and your motives.<br><br>
But I'm part of a peado hunter group and no my quarry as well as those that hunt em, and you definitely ain't one</div></blockquote>

He's intentionally misspelling to throw off pattern tracks. He's also using the "give them a crumb so they forget about the rest of the cookie" tactic, thinking he can buy me off with a false compliment. <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>from BreadBong sent 20 hours ago<br>
Yes ..<br><br>
Doing everything you can to have the word peado show up on the front page of sites that have anti peado measures in place, have zero discussion or promotion of peadophilia or any interest from the user base in the subject as a whole is mighty mighty Sus.<br><br>
Especially as you had the reasons explained to you and chose to ignore</div></blockquote>

Anti pedo measures he says, I've yet to see any. In fact, I've only seen the contrary. <br><br><a href="https://www.voat.xyz/profile.php?user=Antipedosociety&amp;view=comments" class="postlink">https://www.voat.xyz/profile.php?user=A ... w=comments</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>
You're not wrong<br>
from BreadBong sent 19 hours ago<br>
You provided no proof.<br><br>
Your claim was that Blumen publicly promotes peados, but he unequivocally, in public says he hates peados.<br><br>
I've not seen him post peado promoting stuff.<br><br>
I have seen him sail close to the wind. To do so once or twice can be a troll or a shit post, but to the degree you claim he's doing it makes him more likely to be a fed engaged in forum breaking activities</div></blockquote> Flashback to @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4091" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">TexasVet</a> saying "YOU HAVE ZERO PROOF!" in the face of mountains of proof <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br><br>
Also note what he said here. "He says he hates paedos". That happened legitimately right after this conversation happened: <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>blumen4alles wrote:<br>
This whole thing started with ALS and you morons believe that I am a pedophile when I have never admitted to being one</div></blockquote> The timing was a wee bit too convenient for this to show up on a completely different site: <br><br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/orzgtw.PNG" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br>
That's when I noticed the original blumen is a pedo thread had been brigaded after the fact, and the pro pedo shit upvoted. That wording was only ever used on talk.loli, where they call it "shitting up" forums, or in my case they called it shitting up the chat. The clincher though was this: <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>from BreadBong sent 1 hour ago<br>
Are you trolling or really this simple.<br><br>
Why the fuck is a peado going to legit peado post on voat?<br><br>
Fucking voat, one of the few places on the internet where you posting a picture of a hot swimsuit model will get you downdooted into oblivion, called a kike and instructed to get help.<br><br>
There exists the outside possibility that it's to connect with other peados, but it makes no sense to do that on voat, when sites like Reddit exist (where admins will protect you and are peados and degenerates themselves)<br><br>
Always always the motive has to match up with the actions. (This is one of the tools used to detect feds btw. When a person's stated motives do not match up with all of their actions. This can also be the case with inferred motives).<br><br>
Logic it out...blumen is a peado Why is he posting that mark rydon stuff? Why is he making grass on the pitch puns? Why is he denying being a peado?<br><br>
Now logic blumen is a fed engaged in forum splitting Why is he posting contentious art that's sure to spark viceral disagreement and arguments? Why is he posting grass on the pitch puns....just as app the peado noise on the site has finally died down? Why would he act like a peado to some but act like an anti peado to others?</div></blockquote>

Did you catch it? <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Fucking voat, one of the few places on the internet where you posting a picture of a hot swimsuit model will get you downdooted into oblivion, called a kike and instructed to get help.</div></blockquote>

Why does that seem to be the pattern? The obsession with not only porn, but also the complaining about being downvoted for it... On a forum where it's well known that porn is a Jewish psyop, that it's unpopular, that it will cause a negative backlash... He seems to know all about "voat" yet steered clear of the admin going to bat for bitch blume 100% of the time, even banning antipedos speaking against it. <br><br>
I recall that being the exact pattern of @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2487" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">Rotteuxx</a> Artificial_gentile @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3880" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">mikenigger</a> @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1015" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">fightknightHERO</a> and every other degenerate pedophile on talk.loli.
