<br>
1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; <br>
2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. <br>
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; <br>
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. <br>
2 Timothy4 KJV<br>
<br>
19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. <br>
20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. <br>
21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. <br>
Revelation 19 KJV<br>
1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. <br>
2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, <br>
3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. <br>
4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. <br>
5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. <br>
6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. <br>
7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, <br>
8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. <br>
9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. <br>
10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. <br>
Revelation 20 KJV<br>
<br>
1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, <br>
2 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: <br>
3 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, <br>
4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) <br>
5 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; <br>
6 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: <br>
7 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. <br>
8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; <br>
9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: <br>
10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, <br>
11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: <br>
12 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. <br>
13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. <br>
14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, <br>
15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, <br>
16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; <br>
17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, <br>
18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; <br>
19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. <br>
Ephesians 3 KJV</div>
