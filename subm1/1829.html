<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1. All products will have become services. <strong class="text-strong">“I don't own anything. I don't own a car. I don't own a house. I don't own any appliances or any clothes,”</strong> writes Danish MP Ida Auken. Shopping is a distant memory in the city of 2030, whose inhabitants have cracked clean energy and borrow what they need on demand. It sounds utopian, until she mentions that <strong class="text-strong">her every move is tracked and outside the city live swathes of discontents</strong>, the ultimate depiction of a society split in two.</div></blockquote>

Totalitarianism.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>3. <strong class="text-strong">US dominance is over. We have a handful of global powers. Nation states will have staged a comeback</strong>, writes Robert Muggah, Research Director at the Igarapé Institute. <strong class="text-strong">Instead of a single force, a handful of countries – the U.S., Russia, China, Germany, India and Japan chief among them – show semi-imperial tendencies. However, at the same time, the role of the state is threatened by trends including the rise of cities and the spread of online identities</strong></div></blockquote>

"Nation states will have staged a comeback" is presented as a bad scenario. US dominance being over may have bad consequences for the West, because it may be replaced by non-western regimes which do not uphold our ideas.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>5. <strong class="text-strong">We are eating much less meat. Rather like our grandparents, we will treat meat as a treat rather than a staple</strong>, writes Tim Benton, Professor of Population Ecology at the University of Leeds, UK. It won’t be big agriculture or little artisan producers that win, but rather a combination of the two, with convenience food redesigned to be healthier and less harmful to the environment.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>6.<strong class="text-strong"><strong class="text-strong"> Today’s Syrian refugees, 2030’s CEOs. Highly educated Syrian refugees will have come of age by 2030, making the case for the economic integration of those who have been forced to flee conflict.</strong></strong> The world needs to be better prepared for populations on the move, writes Lorna Solis, Founder and CEO of the NGO Blue Rose Compass, as <strong class="text-strong">climate change will have displaced 1 billion people.</strong></div></blockquote>

Take in these CEOs ! it's good for the economy, you nazi! It's your fault because of global warming!<br>
<br>
It's always ideal for elites to have a manipulable, uneducated, unintelligent low class which will gladly vote for them in exchange for welfare, benefits, "rights" and telling them what they want to hear. It becomes a horde that enforces your will and votes for you, so there's no need for fraud since it's legal. People are frightened by crime rates and thus accept more authoritarian measures; see how in UK they took guns, knives, deleted facebook posts, etc. See Argentina as well.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>7.<strong class="text-strong"> The values that built the West will have been tested to breaking point</strong>. We forget the checks and balances that bolster our democracies at our peril, writes Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch.</div></blockquote>

They meant that not taking in refugees and not adhering to their view of human rights, democracy, etc. is breaking the values of the West. In reality, what breaks the western values is marxism, indoctrination, globalism and non-western migration. Maybe that's what they meant...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A new kind of capitalism takes root<br>
—Sonja Haut, head of strategic measurement and materiality, Novartis<br>
In 2030,<strong class="text-strong"> a new economy is established that addresses the needs of all stakeholders – communities, vendors, customers, employees and company owners</strong>. This new breed of new capitalism is enabled thanks to a new way of assessing the performance of companies based on a valuation of their overall impact - a change in which policymakers and standard-setters have played a crucial role. <strong class="text-strong">Governments, stock markets and businesses fully embrace the new order that has given rise to a thriving new type of public-private partnership.</strong> The new way of assessing business performance is based on standardized, comprehensive and simple impact-valuation metrics. <strong class="text-strong">These enhance the usual financial statements with other dimensions like society, human rights and the environment, leading to a ‘total impact’ rating</strong> that is used by management and investors alike<strong class="text-strong">. Governments appreciate ‘total impact’ as key information in understanding the relevance of a sector and individual business, beyond the GDP and employment figures that were the dominant measures of wealth contribution 10 years ago. ‘Total impact’ is a simple way of assessing how much a sector or a business contributes to social coherence, citizens’ wellbeing, environmental protection and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Consumers and investors appreciate the transparency that ‘total impact’ provides for each product.</strong></div></blockquote>

Translation: The government will make sure your business adapts to their view of wellbeing and the will of the UN. Notice how they call it the "new order". "Public-private partnership" is a dangerous idea, since it may lead to interventionism, socialism and central planning of the economy, losing the right to private property.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Welcome to the year 2030. Welcome to my city - or should I say, <strong class="text-strong">"our city". I don't own anything. I don't own a car. I don't own a house. I don't own any appliances or any clothes.</strong><br>
<br>
It might seem odd to you, but it makes perfect sense for us in this city. Everything you considered a product, has now become a service. We have access to transportation, accommodation, food and all the things we need in our daily lives. <strong class="text-strong">One by one all these things became free</strong>, so it ended up not making sense for us to own much.<br>
<br>
First<strong class="text-strong"> communication became digitized and free to everyone</strong>. Then, when<strong class="text-strong"> clean energy became free,</strong> things started to move quickly. Transportation dropped dramatically in price. It made<strong class="text-strong"> no sense for us to own cars anymore</strong>, because we could call a driverless vehicle or a flying car for longer journeys within minutes. We started transporting ourselves in a much more organized and coordinated way when public transport became easier, quicker and more convenient than the car. Now I can hardly believe that we accepted congestion and traffic jams, not to mention the air pollution from combustion engines. What were we thinking?</div></blockquote>

No such thing as "free"; only state-funded. If you own nothing and "everything is free" in "our city"... That means you live in a collectivist society in which the state owns everything. In other words: communism. What the state gives, the state can take away. The idea can be compared to China's social credit system; if you don't comply with what the government deems right, certain rights can be taken away. I have the feeling this is going to end up with a governing elite owning everything while most people depend on them to live. Imagine the mismanagement, inefficiency, corruption and despotism of having the state own everything.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In our city <strong class="text-strong">we don't pay any rent, because someone else is using our free space whenever we do not need it. My living room is used for business meetings when I am not there.</strong></div></blockquote>

What could possibly go wrong?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This also made the breakthrough of the <strong class="text-strong">circular economy</strong> easier. When products are turned into services, no one has an interest in things with a short life span. <strong class="text-strong">Everything is designed for durability, repairability and recyclability. The materials are flowing more quickly in our economy and can be transformed to new products pretty easily. </strong><br>
<br>
Shopping? I can't really remember what that is. For most of us, it has been turned into choosing things to use. Sometimes I find this fun, and <strong class="text-strong">sometimes I just want the algorithm to do it for me. It knows my taste better than I do by now.</strong></div></blockquote>

It knows my taste better than I do by now. How? It must be tracking everything you do.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> When <strong class="text-strong"> AI and robots took over so much of our work</strong>, we suddenly had time to eat well, sleep well and spend time with other people. The concept of rush hour makes no sense anymore, since the work that we do can be done at any time. I don't really know if I would call it work anymore. It is more like thinking-time, creation-time and development-time.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">My biggest concern is all the people who do not live in our city. Those we lost on the way. Those who decided that it became too much, all this technology. Those who felt obsolete and useless when robots and AI took over big parts of our jobs. Those who got upset with the political system and turned against it. They live different kind of lives outside of the city. Some have formed little self-supplying communities. Others just stayed in the empty and abandoned houses in small 19th century villages.</strong></div></blockquote>

The outsiders who don't want to live in the utopia... People like you and I who saw it coming. Why did technology become "too much" for them? Why were they upset with the political system enough to turn against it?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">Once in awhile I get annoyed about the fact that I have no real privacy. No where I can go and not be registered. I know that, somewhere, everything I do, think and dream of is recorded. I just hope that nobody will use it against me.</strong></div></blockquote>

The utopia. This is what statists don't see; they want the state to control everything while complaining about the government being "fascist" and get surprised when politicians act like politicians and abuse their power. You will have to "hope" it isn't used against you.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>So our diets may be more veg and fruit, whole grains and vegetarian food or new alternatives <strong class="text-strong">(soya products, or perhaps insects or artificial meat</strong>), and less fried and sugary things. We’ll still eat meat, but, perhaps more like our parents and grandparents, see it as a treat to savour every few days.</div></blockquote>

"If you don't eat soy, insects or artificial meat you're a bigot who hates the planet. Meat should be regulated by the state because experts told us it's totally safe to eat lab-grown meat!"<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2. Say hello to your pet “Crispy”: CRISPR (Continuous Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats) is a biochemist’s way of saying that <strong class="text-strong">we can cheaply and reliably edit genes.</strong> Today, cat lovers crave exotic breeds, such as the toyger. Tomorrow, your family pet may be a genetically engineered tiger, yet the size of a common housecat. <strong class="text-strong">Should regulatory bodies ban CRISPR technologies in humans, underground labs will flourish worldwide, as parents aim to eliminate congenital genetic disorders or give their kids a heritable advantage in school and life. This will create new disparities and stigmas. Criminality and human trafficking will take on a new dimension of insidiousness when genetic identity no longer can be confirmed.</strong><br>
<br>
4. Ads – a necessary evil:<strong class="text-strong"> Someone has to pay for all of this change, and it is still going to be us in the form of targeted advertising. Your communications device, or whatever replaces functions currently served by today’s cellphone, may be free or heavily subsidized.</strong> But you won’t be able to skip the latest immersive advertising, at least without paying a fee. <strong class="text-strong">You will be more connected than ever before, though advertisers will find clever ways to influence your behaviour, based on the same biometric technology that monitors your health.</strong><br>
<br>
5. <strong class="text-strong">The age of implantables</strong>: As our world changes, scientists believe that humans’ brains will continue to get bigger, our lifespans will increase, and <strong class="text-strong">our cultures will continue to evolve and merge as we adapt to new environments</strong>. Today, you can have 20/10 vision with LASIK. Tomorrow, you may add infrared zoom lenses to your vision making 20/1 vision possible (hawks are estimated to have 20/5 or 20/4 vision). Today, we have wearable devices that can detect magnetic north and give a SONAR-like capability (useful for the visually impaired). Tomorrow, you will meet your “always-on” virtual assistant. <strong class="text-strong">Eventually, our descendants will be unrecognizable</strong>.</div></blockquote>

Eugenics is the dangerous scenario of having the state decide the destiny of future human generations, having power over who has children and who hasn't. They also advocate for transhumanism; becoming cyborgs, if you will.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We’re entering the era of the <strong class="text-strong">“Internet of Bodies”: collecting our physical data via a range of devices that can be implanted, swallowed or worn. The result is a huge amount of health-related data that could improve human wellbeing around the world, and prove crucial in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. But a number of risks and challenges must be addressed to realize the potential of this technology, from privacy issues to practical hurdles.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">After the Internet of Things, which transformed the way we live, travel and work by connecting everyday objects to the Internet, it’s now time for the Internet of Bodies. This means collecting our physical data via devices that can be implanted, swallowed or simply worn, generating huge amounts of health-related information.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">In 2017, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration approved the first use of digital pills in the United States. Digital pills contain tiny, ingestible sensors, as well as medicine. Once swallowed, the sensor is activated in the patient’s stomach and transmits data to their smartphone or other devices.</strong><br>
<br>
They argue for a so-called “right to reasonable inferences”, meaning the right to have your data used only for reasonable, socially acceptable inferences. This would involve setting standards on whether and when inferring certain information from a person’s data, including the state of their present or future health, is socially acceptable or overly invasive.</div></blockquote>

Who decides what a "reasonable inference" is? Socially acceptable can mean anything as long as people don't complain. Internet of things is dangerous since home appliances can be potentially hacked and be used to surveil people against their will. Internet of bodies adds your body to that; implantable devices that keep track of you. Remember the "we're all gonna get chipped by the government to keep track of us" conspiracy? This is pretty much it. What if they put swallowable implants conspicuously? What could happen to those who refuse?<br>
<br>
Of course, all of this is for covid, apparently. Put on the chip, bigot! You're gonna kill us all !<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Why 2030?</strong><br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/" class="postlink">https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopme ... nt-agenda/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Sustainable Development Goals are a <strong class="text-strong">universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere</strong>. The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the <strong class="text-strong">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</strong> which set out a 15-year plan to achieve the Goals.<br>
<br>
With just under ten years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, <strong class="text-strong">world leaders at the SDG Summit in September 2019 called for a Decade of Action and delivery for sustainable development, and pledged to mobilize financing, enhance national implementation and strengthen institutions to achieve the Goals by the target date of 2030, leaving no one behind.</strong><br>
<br>
The <strong class="text-strong">UN Secretary-General</strong> called on all sectors of society to mobilize for a decade of action on three levels: global action to secure greater leadership, more resources and smarter solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals; local action embedding the needed <strong class="text-strong">transitions in the policies, budgets, institutions and regulatory frameworks of governments, cities and local authorities; and people action, including by youth, civil society, the media, the private sector, unions, academia and other stakeholders, to generate an unstoppable movement pushing for the required transformations.</strong></div></blockquote>

See my post called "Abolish the United Nations" to see who the UN secretary-general is...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Numerous civil society leaders and organizations have also called for a “super year of activism” to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, urging world leaders to redouble efforts to reach the people furthest behind, support local action and innovation,<strong class="text-strong"> strengthen data systems</strong> and institutions, rebalance the relationship between people and nature, and unlock more financing for sustainable development.<br>
<br>
At the core of the 2020-2030 decade is the need for action to <strong class="text-strong">tackle growing poverty, empower women and girls, and address the climate emergency.</strong></div></blockquote>

In other words; socialism.</div>
