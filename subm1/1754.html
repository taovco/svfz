			<div class="content">Definition: the use of medicine, drugs or spells<br>
Usage: magic, sorcery, enchantment. <br>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5331.htm" class="postlink">https://biblehub.com/greek/5331.htm</a><br>
<br>
<br>
The symbol of medicine is the caduceus: two serpents wound around a staff<br>
The bronze serpent that God had the Hebrews construct was a symbol of Satan’s defeat, not his curative powers.<br>
 the use of the image of a serpent to represent healing is in direct contradiction to the words of God and of Jesus.<br>
<br>
"Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life."<br>
<br>
Medical Idolatry: <br>
<br>
The most common idol in western culture today, by far, is medicine – the new “magic.”<br>
It is believed that life itself is dependent on medicine, and this belief system is used to justify the authority and power the medical system has in our culture.<br>

<em class="text-italics">This absorbing work assembles an extraordinary range of evidence for the existence of sorcerers and sorceresses in the ancient world, and addresses the<br>
question of their identities and social origins.<br>
</em><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>....That magicians, meaning those expert in magic and making a living from it, were actually burned alive by the middle of the second century AD is certainly<br>
the case.30 That much is clear from a rhetorical exercise from the pen of a contemporary of Apuleius, the sophist and rhetor, Hadrian of Tyre... Hadrian argues that the woman should herself by burned alive, on the ground that, since the law speak not of one who has committed sorcery but of a sorceress (<span style="color:#FFFF00">pharmakis</span>), it applies its punishment to the art of sorcery and expresses its detestation of the power the art gives. Hadrian’s interpretation of the law looks like a clever piece of casuistry, but what can hardly be in doubt is that he is referring to a clause in a law that explicitly mentioned the burning of sorcerers...</div></blockquote>

Matthew W.Dickie teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He has written on envy and the <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#FF0080">Evil Eye</span></strong>, on the learned magician, on ancient erotic<br>
magic, and on the interpretation of ancient magical texts. <br>

The single eye, or the eye of Providence originates in Egypt with the eye of Horus. In conspiracy theory lore, it represents allegiance to Satan and the Illuminati.</div></blockquote>

Questions have been raised over a recent Bloomberg report which said the United National Congress (UNC) employed the services of data-mining company Cambridge Analytica in Trinidad and Tobago in 2013...The report said that SCL Group, the British affiliate of Cambridge Analytica allegedly helped a candidate in Trinidad by emblazoning graffiti slogans around the island that ‘ostensibly was posted by young Trinidadians’.<br>

			<div class="content"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The caduceus is often incorrectly used as a symbol of healthcare organizations and medical practice, particularly in the United States of America, due to confusion with the traditional medical symbol, the Rod of Asclepius, which has only one snake and is never depicted with wings (the logo of the World Health Organization uses the Rod of Asclepius as its basis).</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Rod of Asclepius takes its name from the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with healing and medicinal arts in Greek mythology. Asclepius' attributes, the snake and the staff, sometimes depicted separately in antiquity, are combined in this symbol...<br>
<br>
In honor of Asclepius, a particular type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes – the Aesculapian snakes – crawled around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. These snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of Asclepius throughout the classical world. From about 300 BCE onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples (Asclepieia) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary – the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation.[3] Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick the wounds of sick petitioners.<br>
<br>
The original Hippocratic Oath began with the invocation "I swear by Apollo the Healer and by Asclepius and by Hygieia and Panacea and by all the gods ..."<br>
<br>
..The adoption, in 1902, of the caduceus for US Army medical officer uniforms popularized the (mis)use of the symbol throughout the medical field in the United States.</div></blockquote></div>
