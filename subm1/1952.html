<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Christian theosophy, also known as Boehmian theosophy and theosophy, refers to a range of positions within Christianity which focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of divinity and the origin and purpose of the universe. They have been characterized as mystical philosophies.[1] Theosophy is considered part of Western esotericism, which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to enlightenment and salvation.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher Jakob Böhme. Jewish Kabbalah was also formative for Christian theosophy from Böhme on..</span> .. In 1875, the term "theosophy" was adopted and revived by the Theosophical Society, an esoteric organization which spawned a spiritual movement also called Theosophy.. Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of <span style="color:#FF0040">Paracelsus</span> (1493–1541).<br>
<br>
Böhme's work has been described as being "foundational" for Christian theosophy.[22] There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific.[23] Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by Jan Baptist van Helmont (1618–1699), Robert Fludd (1574–1637), John Pordage (1608–1681), Jane Leade (1623–1704), Henry More (1614–1687), Pierre Poiret (1646–1719), and Antoinette Bourignon (1616–1680).[24] Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying <span style="color:#FF0040">active imaginatio</span>n in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries.[9][25] In Athanasius Kircher's Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in ancient Egypt, and to <span style="color:#FFFF00">Neo-Platonism</span>, and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics</div></blockquote>

Human Blood/Corpses were used in ORAL medicinal remedies by ROYALTY, PRIESTS, &amp; SCIENTISTS throughout Europe.. Noble’s new book, Medicinal Cannibalism in Early Modern English Literature and Culture, and another by Richard Sugg of England’s University of Durham, Mummies, Cannibals and Vampires: The History of Corpse Medicine from the Renaissance to the Victorians, reveal that for several hundred years, peaking in the 16th and 17th centuries, many Europeans, including royalty, priests and scientists, routinely ingested remedies containing human bones, blood and fat as medicine for everything from headaches to epilepsy....BLOOD WAS PROCURED AS FRESH AS POSSIBLE, WHILE IT WAS STILL THOUGHT TO CONTAIN THE VITALITY OF THE BODY. This requirement made it challenging to acquire. <span style="color:#FFFF00">The 16th century German-Swiss physician Paracelsus</span> believed BLOOD WAS GOOD FOR DRINKING, and one of his followers even suggested TAKING BLOOD FROM A LIVING BODY. ...</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>At least in the English- and German-speaking worlds, this is undoubtedly the most famous prayer originated in modern times, probably the only prayer ever to rival the Lord's Prayer in popularity. Billy Pilgrim hung it on his office wall in Slaughterhouse-Five; Bill Clinton ’73JD invoked it repeatedly when he campaigned for the presidency. It has given inspiration and solace to millions of people and has been very prominently employed by Alcoholics Anonymous.<br>

<br>
<em class="text-italics">“We need new faith in our own highest ideals,” says Miss Mildred Pinkerton, executive secretary of the Syracuse Y.W.C.A. She calls attention to new determinations, new interests in her annual report recently submitted. Quotes the prayer—“O God, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to accept what cannot be helped, and insight to know the one from the other.”<br>
</em><br>
  —Syracuse Herald, January 16, <span style="color:#FF0040">1936</span>, page 22</div></blockquote>

Interesting that the earlier German sources were missed by the famous Yale librarian.  So, according to Yale, Miss Mildred Pinkerton, executive secretary of the Syracuse Y.W.C.A was the earliest source of the poem/prayer, at least in the US.  <br>

			<div class="content"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Active Imagination</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_imagination" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_imagination</a> ::<br>
<br>
Active imagination is a conscious method of experimentation. It employs creative imagination as an organ for "perceiving outside your own mental boxes." For the first hundred years of active imagination, it was applied primarily by individuals for exploring their own sub- and unconscious; hence its value in psycho-therapeutic settings. Until the theme of the "inner child" in the 1970s, active imagination was most closely associated with C. G. Jung's experiments with himself and with clients emphasizing its therapeutic value.<br>
<br>
The theosophy of post-Renaissance Europe embraced imaginal cognition. From <span style="color:#FFFF00">Jakob Böhme to Swedenborg</span>, active imagination played a large role in theosophical works. In this tradition, the active imagination serves as an "organ of the soul, thanks to which humanity can establish a cognitive and visionary relationship with an intermediate world"..<br>
<br>
As developed by Carl Jung between 1913 and 1916,[3] active imagination is a meditation technique wherein the contents of one's unconscious are translated into images, narrative or personified as separate entities... Rudolf Steiner suggested cultivating imaginative consciousness through meditative contemplation of texts, objects, or images. The resulting imaginal cognition he believed to be an initial step on a path leading from rational consciousness toward ever-deeper spiritual experience.<br>
<br>
Islamic tradition - The imaginal realm is known in Islamic philosophy as <em class="text-italics">alam al-mithal</em>, the imaginal world. According to Avicenna, the imagination mediated between, and thus unified, human reason and divine being. .. Through Averroes, mainstream Islamic philosophy lost its relationship to the active imagination. The Sufi movement, as exemplified by Ibn Arabi, continued to explore contemplative approaches to the imaginal realm<br>
<br>
Henry Corbin considered imaginal cognition to be a "purely spiritual faculty independent of the physical organism and thus surviving it"..More recently, the imaginal concept was further developed in Communication Sciences domain. Samuel Mateus (2013) suggested a close link between imaginary, society and publicity. The "public imaginal" was named after the dynamic, symbolic and complex set of diverse and heterogeneous imaginaries that permeate societies.<br>
<br>
Role in scientific and mathematical discovery - Hadamard (1954)[21] and Châtelet (1991)[22] suggest that imagination and conceptual experiment play central roles in mathematical creativity. Important scientific discoveries have been made through imaginative cognition, such as Kekulé's famous discovery of the carbon ring structure of benzene through a dream of a snake eating its tail.<br>

“The earth will be a heaven in the 21st century in comparison with what it is now.” – Madame Blavatsky<br>
<br>
The artist and collector Katherine Dreier was a follower of Madame Blavatsky’s theosophy, along with many of the artists that she collected and exhibited, including Piet Mondrian and Vasily Kandinsky. Along with Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp, Dreier in 1920 set up the Société Anonyme, the focus of a startling exhibition now at the Dallas Museum of Art, as a way to promote modern art that held the potential for radical social and spiritual transformation similar to that espoused by theosophy.<br>
<br>
Art, Theosophy, and Kandinsky - <a href="https://www.theosophyforward.com/theosophy-and-the-society-in-the-public-eye/47-articles/theosophy-and-the-society-in-the-public-eye/381-art-theosophy-and-kandinsky" class="postlink">https://www.theosophyforward.com/theoso ... -kandinsky</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FFFF00">The influence of Theosophy on modern culture is a well-kept secret</span>, even from many Theosophists... Art historians sometimes assert that abstract art is nonrepresentational—depicting nothing, being just a pattern of colors and shapes. That, however, was not Kandinsky view. He believed that his art was esoteric. His abstract paintings certainly did not represent the outer or exoteric form of things; they were intended to represent in inner side of reality. Kandinsky thought such art is a way to transform oneself—both the artist who produces it and the viewer who contemplates it. In arriving at that conclusion, Kandinsky was greatly influenced by Theosophy.<br>
<br>
He read Theosophical books, particularly those of H. P. Blavatsky and also those of Annie Besant and <span style="color:#FFFF00">C. W. Leadbeater, whose book Thought Forms influenced his painting.</span><br>
<br>
..Along with many other artists and thinkers of the time, Kandinsky believed that by the beginning of the twentieth century, western civilization had reached a crisis and was sinking under a crushing materialism. It was the artist's task to lead society out of this impasse and to open new avenues of meaning and significance. One vehicle for achieving this was Theosophy. The influence Kandinsky's occult reading had on his ideas of the coming "Epoch of the Great Spiritual" is clear in his influential manifesto Ãœber das Geistige in der Kunst, Concerning the Spiritual in Art (1912), one of the most important theoretical works in the history of modern art.<br>
<br>
Kandinsky's occult library was considerable, but certain books in particular fuelled his speculation. Three key works were Man, Visible and Invisible (1902) by C. W. Leadbeater, Thought-Forms (1905) by Annie Besant and Leadbeater, and Rudolf Steiner's Theosophy (1904). Kandinsky was very interested in Steiner, and attended some of his lectures in Munich and Berlin. He was also a keen reader of Steiner's theosophical journal, Luzifer-Gnosis, and in his notebooks Kandinsky copied out several passages from a series of articles Steiner had written entitled "Von der Aura des Menschen" (On Man's Aura). Kandinsky was interested in a great deal of Steiner's thought [<em class="text-italics">as was Einstein</em>]. The interested reader might look to Ringbom's study or the internet for material about Kandinsky's interest in the occult, as well as informa-tion on<span style="color:#FFFF00"> his friend Arnold Schoenberg, who combined an interest in Steiner with one in the Swedish religious thinker Emanuel Swedenborg</span>....</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

One can see such Theosophist influence as "active imagination" in a number of Netflix programs.. e.g. Behind Her Eyes.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>While infused with Christian ideas, Van Helmont’s views are also deeply imbued with a philosophy inspired by medical alchemy...The term ‘medical alchemy’ must also be taken to imply a strong philosophical component.

This view was fully embraced by Van Helmont, who called himself ‘philosopher by fire’. These two terms, ‘medical alchemy’ and ‘Christian thought’ are hence key elements that comprise the framework of Van Helmont’s ‘Christian Philosophy’..</div></blockquote>

Shurlock’s bulwark against homosexuality is especially interesting when one considers that Katherine Tingley’s most aggressive weapon against her great rival in the Theosophical world, Annie Besant, head of the Adyar Society, was propaganda, widely distributed in a series of tracts, that denigrated Besant for the continued support within her organization of <span style="color:#FFFF00">reputed pederast Charles Webster Leadbeater</span>. To articulate the distinction between the American lodges and those led by Besant in the UK, Europe and India, Tingley vociferously campaigned against Besant’s harboring of an admitted homosexual. One early historian of Point Loma wrote that Tingley “doubtless hoped to establish in the public mind a distinction of Point Loma as the center of ‘pure’ Theosophy and Adyar as the disseminator of an ‘unpure’ brand.”

Naval Base Point Loma consists of seven facilities: Submarine Base, Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command (previously Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Command), Fleet Combat Training Center Pacific, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), SPAWAR Systems Center, the Fleet Intelligence Command Pacific and Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar. <br>
<br>
The history of Point Loma Naval Base begins in 1795. The Spanish began building a fort at the base of Point Guijarros, opposite the tip of North Island (Coronado). This fort was built on the land which is today known as Ballast Point. Fort Guijarros was later finished in 1798 and then abandoned by the Mexicans in 1845. In 1846 United States <span style="color:#FF0040">Capt. Samuel Du Pont</span>, entered the abandoned land where the fort once stood and raised the American flag. Shortly after in 1848 the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican–American War and the Americans claimed Point Loma.</div></blockquote>

<br>
After the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler and World War II, the company portrayed itself to the Allied Control Authority as a Christian publisher that was part of the resistance to Nazism and allegedly persecuted. Ties to National Socialist organizations were initially denied. After it became known that erroneous, or at least inadequate, statements had been made, Heinrich Mohn stepped down as the head of the publishing house.[27] Reinhard Mohn, one of his three sons, took over the C. Bertelsmann Verlag, as Hans Heinrich Mohn had been killed in the war and Sigbert Mohn was still a prisoner of war.[28] In 1947, the Allies finally granted the company a publishing license.</div></blockquote>

In this German article on Bertelsmann the connections with the CIA are mentioned: Bertelsmann and DER SPIEGEL <a href="http://de.indymedia.org/2008/06/220177.shtml" class="postlink">http://de.indymedia.org/2008/06/220177.shtml</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Many people still don't know which companies all belong to the media giant Bertelsmann - above all the so-called news magazine DER SPIEGEL.

<br>
[in comments :]<br>
<br>
In the comment above, Reinhard Mohn is portrayed as a nice old man. This is remarkable because we all know the results of the work of this nice man and his wife Liz. About Reinhard MOhn, who still controls the company through the Bertelsmann Foundation, is the following in the party book Wiki :..<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">On April 7th, 2008, my party book referred to a forum post made by "Sterling Seagrave" as follows: "In the party book in the article“ On the history of media control ”yesterday, a“ Sterling Seagrave ”wrote in a forum post, later the <span style="color:#FFFF00">CIA CEO Bill Casey</span> was one of the key figures (in the US secret service) in the acquisition of media after World War II and a young German who was sent to Germany after the war and took over Bertelsmann was one of his protégés<span style="color:#FFFF00"> Who now thinks Bertelsmann is a front company of the CIA and Reinhard Mohn a CIA agent.</span> "</em><br>
<br>
There is only one very vague reference to this suspicion. So this suspicion does not have to be correct, but perhaps one or the other may check whether other actions in the story can be conclusively explained with this train of thought. There is something amazing to discover. According to his own account in his biography, Reinhard Mohn was in a prisoner-of-war camp in the USA. After the war, it was the American military administration that ensured that Reinhard Mohn was put in charge of Bertelsmann. Sterling Seagrave's forum post can be found <a href="https://educationforum.ipbhost.com/topic/5142-operation-mockingbird/page/16/?tab=comments#comment-115395" class="postlink"><span style="color:#FF0040">here</span></a>. The thread is about Operation Mockingbird, which the US government has since admitted and with which the CIA operated media control at home and abroad in the 1960s with a budget of more than 250 million dollars annually. The Operation Mockingbird googling times is certainly interesting in any case. Anyone who also knows the importance of propaganda for the military and knows the secret stay-behind armies of NATO may think that Bertelsmann's media is psychological warfare .

<span style="color:#FF0040">Michael Deaver died over the weekend. All the obituarities miss out an important part of his career. As most members know, most of my pages appear near the top of Google searches. Not so, with Deaver. My page is nowhere to be found. Deaver was being protected by those who control Google and Wikipedia. What is it that the ruling elite do not want you to know about Deaver. It is the following:</span><br>
Michael Deaver co-founded the public relations company, Deaver and Hannaford in 1975. The company "booked Reagan's public appearances, research and sell his radio program, and ghost-write his syndicated column." Peter Dale Scott claims that "all this was arranged with an eye to Reagan's presidential aspirations, which Deaver and Hannaford helped organize from the outset".<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF00">In 1977 Deaver and Hannaford registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents </span>receiving $5,000 a month from the government of Taiwan. It also received $11,000 a month from a group called Amigos del Pais (Friends of the Country) in Guatemala. The head of Amigos del Pais was Roberto Alejos Arzu. He was the principal organizer of Guatemala's "Reagan for President" organization. Arzu was a CIA asset who in 1960 allowed his plantation to be used to train Cuban exiles for the Bay of Pigs invasion....<br>
<br>
...According to Barbara Honegger, a researcher and policy analyst with the 1980 Reagan/Bush campaign, William J. Casey and other representatives of the Reagan presidential campaign made a deal at two sets of meetings in July and August at the Ritz Hotel in Madrid with Iranians to delay the release of Americans held hostage in Iran until after the November 1980 presidential elections. Reagan’s aides promised that they would get a better deal if they waited until Carter was defeated...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF00">William Casey was one of the key men in the acquisition of media after WW2. It was one of his proteges (a young German immigrant to the US) who was sent back to Germany after the war to take over Bertelsmann and build it up.</span> Rupert Murdoch was very tight with Shackley, which is how he got launched on his global acquisitions and has now taken over the WSJ. Murdoch was running a failed national newspaper in Australia while Shackley was station chief in Oz. Then suddenly he becomes a US citizen literally overnight and goes on an endless buying spree. Shackley's pockets were infinitely deep.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>First picked up on this from <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1515874" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1515874</a> about <span style="color:#FF8040">Tampa bay times removing a pedo article.</span>.. [article: How pedophile trail led to a Largo man]<br>
<br>
As the link above shows, an article about a pedo trail that led to a number of people domestically and internationally was available at the Tampa Bay Times...best we can tell a couple weeks ago by the OP...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF00">Craig Newmark of Craigslist donated $1mil to Poynter Journalism School to fight "fake news" in their ethics departmen</span>t. News breaks December 12th same time as heavy #pizzagate stuff. Remember the coinciding dates of the Tampa By Times article going missing - sometime between 12-2 and 12-18. Remember the three articles the author put out at Washington Post: 12-6, 12-7, 12-7...<br>
<br>
Poynter's chairman, Paul Tash, also runs Tampa Bay Times. So, Poynter gets the $, and the chairman runs both poynter and Tampa Bay Times, where the article went poof.<br>
