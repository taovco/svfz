<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br>
<br>
“Black and Hispanic communities throughout the United States have borne the brunt of this pandemic,” Bibbins-Domingo said....More needs to be done to distribute vaccines equitably, to improve working conditions and better protect minorities from infection, and to include them in economic relief measures, she said.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#80FF40">Dr. Otis Brawley, a cancer specialist and public health professor at Johns Hopkins University, agreed.</span>  "Not enough use of masks, <span style="color:#80FF40">early reliance on drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, “which turned out to be worthless,”</span> and other missteps meant many Americans died needlessly", Brawley said.<br>
<br>
“Going forward, we need to practice the very basics” such as hand-washing, physical distancing and vaccinating as soon as possible to get prevention back on track, he said.</div></blockquote>

So the push to vaccinate minorities is on from an article full of disinformation.<br>
<br>
For me there are 2 aspects to this article which need further scrutiny: First- Dr. Otis Brawley and second- POLITICO.<br>
<br>
............................................<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Dr. Otis Brawley</span><br>
<br>
Dr. Otis Brawley actually says that hydroxychloroquine is worthless despite <a href="https://lenbilen.com/2020/12/14/american-medical-association-rescinds-previous-statement-against-prescription-of-hydroxychloroquine-to-covid-19-patients/" class="postlink"><span style="color:#80BFFF">the American Medical Association rescinding their stance on HCQ</span></a> and allowing physicians to prescribe the medication for use in coronavirus treatment and prevention.  They did this after the 2020 election steal, of course.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>So I figured out who owns the top level apartment across from Pegasus, with the similarly drawn blinds, and it's Laura Itzkowitz &amp; Catherine Rivkin. Laura Itzkowitz works for USAID, where she specializes in maternal &amp; child nutrition in third world countries, and is on the board of DC non-profit that serves homeless children, New Endeavors by Women. One of New Endeavors financial contributors is none other than Amy Weiss, who is the wife of Peter Kadzik, a very close associate to JOHN PODESTA..<br>
<br>
Catherine Rivkin, a.k.a Katie Rivkin Visser, who works for the Department of Defense, is married to Tim Visser, a trial attorney for the US Department of Justice. Here they are together: <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/fashion/weddings/27RIVKIN/27RIVKIN-facebookJumbo.jpg" class="postlink">https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08 ... kJumbo.jpg</a> . Tim Visser does missionary work in Haiti with Hope On A String. Now why Laura Itzkowitz &amp; Katie Visser both own an apartment together, who knows. I guess the best connection made in all this is that Laura Itzkowitz works on the board of an organization that 'helps' homeless DC children and which is funded in part by close associate to John Podesta, Amy Weiss, ,the wife of former DOJ official Peter Kadzik, who appears through the Podesta e-mails and was invited to one of Podesta's "pizza extravaganzas"...<br>
<br>
There is more to this connection. Kadzik, Comey, McCabe and Yates are a few at the top who obstructed all investigations and inquiries. Why did McCain say in Racine that “he sees foreign assistance as a  factor in securing America”? <span style="color:#FFFF00">What is the ONE campaign related to HIV/AIDS, malaria and illiteracy?</span>   Why was the World Core Curriculum established in Racine? Why did Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders make the “highly unusual move” to endorse a billion dollar referendum in Racine?.... What is the Center for Global Development? What are the “17” goals of Sustainable Development? How are the departments of State, Treasury and Agriculture connected with the US Agency for International Development and the Center for American Progress?</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

Now it makes sense why the Podestas got their "big break" in Racine, because John Podesta is known to be involved in Project Blue Beam and is connected to Tom DeLonge. United Way and Rotary Club both appear to be used to pool resources together, although I am not sure if this is the answer you are looking for..</div></blockquote>.</div>

Letourneau is Director of he Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mary Kay Fualaau (née Mary Katherine Schmitz; born January 30, 1962), formerly known as Mary Kay Letourneau, is an American schoolteacher who was imprisoned from 1997 to 2004 for having sexual intercourse with her 12 year old student, Vili Fualaau. She gave birth to two of Fualaau's children while incarcerated. After her release from prison in 2004, Letourneau married Fualaau and took his name.<br>
<br>
Letourneau was born Mary Katherine Schmitz in Tustin, California to university professor, John G. Schmitz and chemist, Mary Schmitz.[3][4] She was known as Mary Kay to her family and was affectionately called "Cake" by her father. She was the fourth of seven children, raised in a "strict Catholic household."[5][6] When she was two years old her father began his political career and ran for a seat in the state legislature.[6] Later, he held positions as a California state senator and U.S. Congressman and he ran for president as an American Independent Party candidate in the 1972 U.S. presidential election.[7][8]<br>
<br>
In 1973 her three year old brother drowned in the family pool at their home in the Spyglass Hill section of Corona del Mar, California while under the care of Mary Kay and her older brother, Jerry.[7]<br>
<br>
In 1982, Schmitz's political career was severely damaged when it was revealed that during his affair with a former student at Santa Ana College, where he had taught political science, he had fathered two children out of wedlock.[9] Her father's affair caused her parents to separate, but they later reconciled. According to friends Mary Kay felt betrayed and thought her mother was a cold person who "drove him to it" by denying her father affection.[10][11] Schmitz refused to lend financial support or assistance to his illegitimate children who became wards of the state after their mother died.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Schmitz was born in Milwaukee, the son of Wilhelmina (Frueh) and Jacob John Schmitz.[5] Schmitz graduated from Marquette University High School in 1948.[6] He obtained his B.S. degree from Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1952 and an M.A. from California State University, Long Beach, in 1960. He served as a United States Marine Corps jet fighter and helicopter pilot from 1952 to 1960, and was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 1960 to 1983.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Joseph Edward Schmitz (born August 28, 1956) is an American lawyer, former inspector general of the United States Department of Defense and a former executive with Blackwater Worldwide. After working as a watchdog at the Pentagon for three and a half years, Schmitz resigned to return to the private sector. Although allegations questioning his stewardship of the inspector general's office surfaced nine months after his resignation, a high-level review board, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, cleared him of all wrongdoing in 2006.[1] He was named one of Donald Trump's foreign policy advisors for his 2016 presidential campaign..<br>
<br>
Upon graduation from the Naval Academy, Schmitz served in the U.S. Navy for approximately four years, including a stint as an exchange officer with the <span style="color:#FFFF00">German Navy.</span> After leaving active duty, Schmitz went to law school, and was in the Naval Reserve until 2001. He clerked with James L. Buckley, Circuit Judge for the D.C. Circuit Court, and was a special assistant to Attorney General Edwin Meese III during the Reagan Administration.<br>
<br>
He is a member of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta,[7] and a co-author of the book, Sharia: The Threat to America.[8]  <span style="color:#FF4040">As Inspector General, Schmitz investigated involvement of the U.S. military in the sex trade in South Korea, Bosnia, and Kosovo.</span><br>
<br>
On June 18, 2001, Schmitz was nominated by President George W. Bush to act as the Inspector General of the Department of Defense. His nomination was held up in the Senate Armed Services Committee for unknown reasons until March 21, 2002,[citation needed] when he was confirmed by the full Senate by voice vote. One of his first actions as Inspector General was to hire controversial Republican operative L. Jean Lewis as his chief of staff.[9]<br>
<br>
Various senior officials in the Defense Department stated that <span style="color:#FFFF00">Schmitz had an enduring fascination with Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben</span>, having personally redesigned the Defense Department Inspector General's seal to incorporate the Von Steuben family motto.[10] <span style="color:#FFFF00">Schmitz's association with the German journalist, Henning Von Steuben, the leader of the Von Steuben Family Association, attracted the criticism of Senator Chuck Grassley</span>, who stated that Schmitz had "feted Von Steuben at an $800 meal allegedly paid for by public funds."[10] In 2005, Schmitz canceled a planned $200,000 trip to Germany "to attend a ceremony at a Von Steuben statue," after Grassley questioned the expenditure.

..Few Americans know that J.P. Morgan Company began as George Peabody and Company. George Peabody (1795-1869), born at South Danvers, Massachusetts, began business in Georgetown, D.C. in 1814 as Peabody, Riggs and Company, dealing in wholesale dry goods, and in operating the Georgetown Slave Market. In 1815, to be closer to their source of supply, they moved to Baltimore, where they operated as Peabody and Riggs, from 1815 to 1835. Peabody found himself increasingly involved with business originating from London, and in 1835, he established the firm of George Peabody and Company in London. He had excellent entree in London business through another Baltimore firm established in Liverpool, the Brown Brothers. Alexander Brown came to Baltimore in 1801, and established what is now known as the oldest banking house in the United States, still operating as Brown Brothers Harriman of New York; Brown, Shipley and Company of England; and Alex Brown and Son of Baltimore. The behind the scenes power wielded by this firm is indicated by the fact that Sir Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England for many years, was a partner of Brown, Shipley and Company.* Considered the single most influential banker in the world, Sir Montagu Norman was organizer of "informal talks" between heads of central banks in 1927, which led directly to the Great Stockmarket Crash of 1929.<br>
<br>
Soon after he arrived in London, George Peabody was surprised to be summoned to an audience with the gruff Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Without mincing words, Rothschild revealed to Peabody, that much of the London aristocracy openly disliked Rothschild and refused his invitations. He proposed that Peabody, a man of modest means, be established as a lavish host whose entertainments would soon be the talk of London. Rothschild would, of course, pay all the bills. Peabody accepted the offer, and soon became known as the most popular host in London. His annual Fourth of July<br>
dinner, celebrating American Independence, became extremely popular with the English aristocracy, many of whom, while drinking Peabody's wine, regaled each other with jokes about Rothschild's crudities and bad manners, without realizing that every drop they drank had been paid for by Rothschild.<br>

<em class="text-italics">During his London years George Peabody and his banking house rose in prominence. Peabody &amp; Company financed the westward expansion of the American railroads and the laying of the first transatlantic cables. When Peabody retired, his partners, Junius Spencer Morgan and his son, J.P. Morgan, took over the company, which became the House of Morgan.<br>
In 1851, George Peabody underwrote the American installation in the Great Exhibition and the following year he financed the first Anglo-American cooperative scientific venture. In the years that followed he created America's first museums of natural history, archaeology and ethnology at Yale and Harvard Universities and the Peabody Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. After the Civil War he funded the Peabody Education Fund which established public education in the South. In London he founded the Peabody Trust to provide homes for the poor of London. The Peabody Education Fund and the Peabody Trust were the first philanthropic foundations in America and England.</em></div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div>
