			<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State</strong>, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.<br>
<br>
Of course, in the beginning, <strong class="text-strong">this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property</strong>, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon <strong class="text-strong">the old social order</strong>, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">These measures will, of course, be different in different countries. Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.</strong><br>
<br>
1. <strong class="text-strong">Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.</strong><br>
2. A heavy <strong class="text-strong">progressive or graduated income tax.</strong><br>
3. <strong class="text-strong">Abolition of all rights of inheritance.</strong><br>
4.<strong class="text-strong"> Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.</strong><br>
5.<strong class="text-strong"> Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state</strong>, by means of a <strong class="text-strong">national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.</strong><br>
6. <strong class="text-strong">Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.</strong><br>
7. Extension of <strong class="text-strong">factories and instruments of production owned by the State</strong>; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.<br>
8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.<br>
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; <strong class="text-strong">gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.</strong><br>
10. <strong class="text-strong">Free education for all children in public schools</strong>. Abolition of children’s factory labour <strong class="text-strong">in its present form</strong>. Combination of education with industrial production, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Abolition [<em class="text-italics">Aufhebung</em>] of the family!</strong> Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.<br>
<br>
On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.<br>
<br>
The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital. <strong class="text-strong">Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty.</strong><br>
<br>
But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when <strong class="text-strong">we replace home education by social.</strong><br>

<br>
Demands of the German Communist Party<br>
<br>
1. <strong class="text-strong">The whole of Germany shall be declared a united, indivisible republic.</strong><br>
2. Every German who is 21 years old shall be a voter and be eligible for election, assuming he has not been sentenced for a criminal offence.<br>
3. Representatives of the people shall be paid so that workers may also sit in the parliament of the German people.<br>
4. Universal arming of the people. In future armies shall at the same time be workers’ armies so that the armed forces will not only consume, as in the past, but produce even more than it costs to maintain them. In addition, these shall be a means of organising work.<br>
5. Maintenance of <strong class="text-strong">justice shall be free of charge</strong>.<br>
6. All feudal burdens, all fees, labour services, tithes etc. which have previously oppressed the peasantry shall be abolished without any compensation.<br>
7.<strong class="text-strong"> All baronial and other feudal estates, all mines, pits etc. shall be converted into state property</strong>. On these estates agriculture shall be practised on a large scale and with the most modern scientific tools for the benefit of all.<br>
8. <strong class="text-strong">The mortgages on peasant farms shall be declared state property. The interest for these mortgages shall be paid by the peasants to the state</strong>.<br>
9. In the areas where leasing has developed the ground<strong class="text-strong"> rent or lease payment shall be paid to the state as a tax.</strong><br>
All these measures specified under 6, 7, 8 and 9 will be composed in order to minimise public and other burdens of the peasants and small leaseholders without reducing the means necessary to cover public expenses and without endangering production itself.<br>
10. <strong class="text-strong">All private banks will be replaced by a state bank whose bonds will have the character of legal tender.</strong> This measure will make it possible to regulate credit in the interests of the whole people and will thus undermine the dominance of the large financiers. By gradually replacing gold and silver by paper money, it will cheapen the indispensable instrument of bourgeois trade, the universal means of exchange, and will allow the gold and silver to have an outward effect. Ultimately, <strong class="text-strong">this measure is necessary to link the interests of the conservative bourgeoisie to the revolution.</strong><br>
11. <strong class="text-strong">All means of transport: railways, canals, steamships, roads, posts etc. shall be taken in hand by the state. They shall be converted into state property and made available free of charge to the class without financial resources.</strong><br>
12. In the remuneration of all civil servants there shall be no difference except that those with a family, i.e. with greater needs, shall also receive a larger salary than the others.<br>
13.<strong class="text-strong"> Complete separation of church and state</strong>. The clergy of all denominations shall only be paid by their own voluntary congregations.<br>
14. <strong class="text-strong">Limitation of inheritance</strong>.<br>
15. Introduction of <strong class="text-strong">strongly progressive taxes</strong> and abolition of taxes on consumption.<br>
16. Establishment of <strong class="text-strong">national workshops. The state shall guarantee the livelihood of all workers and provide for those unable to work.</strong><br>
17.<strong class="text-strong"> Universal free education of the people.</strong><br>
