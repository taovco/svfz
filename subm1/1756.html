			<div class="content">So, I happened to come across this video by Rachel Elnaugh -  MUTINY on the BLIGHTY <a href="https://youtu.be/v6vrs4QV2mQ" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/v6vrs4QV2mQ</a> .. in her wide-eyed girly voice she talked about people questioning the system and COVID19 etc. etc. using New Age terminology of higher vibrations etc etc.  ... Somehow it wasn't feeling authentic to me and then she said something about her Inner Sanctum, 3 times... That's when my ears pricked up.<br>
<br>
The Inner Sanctum was/is the bit on Peter Ferris's website that is 'subscription only' where he has videos based on satanism and other gothic type videos and which I've written about on pizzagate forums in the past.. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/search.php?st=comments&amp;t=%22inner+sanctum%22+ferris" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/search.php?st=com ... %22+ferris</a><br>
<br>
Peter Ferris was the agent of Ricky Dearman, the father of the Hampstead children. Ferris also holds acting classes for children aspiring to have careers in the theatre or movie business. He was also nominated for the Global Teacher of the Year prize in 2016 :  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-38301838" class="postlink">https://www.bbc.com/news/education-38301838</a> by the Varkey Foundation which we have written about ALOT <a href="https://searchvoat.co/search.php?t=%22varkey+foundation%22&amp;b=on" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/search.php?t=%22v ... on%22&amp;b=on</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Ferris TV (with an Inner Sanctum and Outer Sanctum) <a href="http://www.ferrisentertainment.tv/" class="postlink">http://www.ferrisentertainment.tv/</a> .. On his website homepage notice the link to the 'Ring of Peace..The Ring is an annual event that we hold on the UN International Day of Peace....</div></blockquote>

<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">"Inner Sanctum" is a term used in magician and satanist circles..example</span>: <a href="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/magnum-opus-secrets-of-the-inner-sanctum" class="postlink">https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/magnum ... er-sanctum</a><br>
<br>
So, I looked further into Rachel Elnaugh <a href="http://www.rachelelnaugh.com/biography-2" class="postlink">http://www.rachelelnaugh.com/biography-2</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Former BBCTV Dragons’ Den ‘Dragon’, Rachel Elnaugh is the British entrepreneur who created the £multi-million market leading ‘Red Letter Days’ experience brand. .. She was also commissioned to write a book about the fine line between success and failure in her book ‘Business Nightmares‘ ..The timing of the book launch in May 2008 could not have been more fortuitous as in September 2008 the global banking system crashed triggering the current recession and many other business meltdowns. <br>
<br>
Her work in helping others lead to a fascination with empowerment and the power of the mind, including fourth dimensional energy principles including quantum physics, metaphysics and the Law of Attraction. In 2010 she travelled to Kuala Lumpur to train in feng shui with leading international feng shui author Grand Master Lillian Too...<br>
<br>
Rachel also helped breathe life into The Big Om sound healing concept which took place in Brighton on 12.12.12, triggering a sister London event 12.12.12 One World co-produced by Rachel and Hay House ‘Money Magnet’ author Marie Claire Carlyle.</div></blockquote>

Reading through the entire page it's clear how Rachel was set up to be a New Age 'guru' for the masses.. she also has something to sell..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The colourful Lakshmi cashmere and silk shawl is from the Mudra Collection by Rita Hraiz, Glastonbury <a href="https://mudracollection.com/collections/cashmere-shawls-wraps" class="postlink">https://mudracollection.com/collections ... awls-wraps</a></div></blockquote>

Aww loook.. Rita's at the World Economic Forum too.. <a href="https://www.wef.org.in/rita-hraiz/" class="postlink">https://www.wef.org.in/rita-hraiz/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Rita Hraiz abandoned a highly successful career as a fashion designer, working for Top Shop, Saks Fifth Avenue, Hennes and Hyper Hyper Hyper to look more deeply into the meaning of life and the true purpose of clothes design. </div></blockquote>

Rita lives in Glastonbury.. important little nugget for a future post that will expand on the theme in this post ..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The response to the idea to create an eco-community has been quite breathtaking ~ with over 100 people expressing an interest, and financial indications so far in excess of £7.5million.<br>
Having discussed the project with Robin Scott at length this week, we are agreed that there is the potential to create several different eco-communities in various locations around the UK over the coming months and we are happy to help facilitate this.  Robin is an experienced Project Manager and farmer, also planning to invest.  You can read Robin’s bio at <a href="https://www.lifetech.org.uk/about-us/" class="postlink">https://www.lifetech.org.uk/about-us/</a>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>LifeTech Consultants was originally formed in 1981 and is the result of many years of collaboration between Robin Scott and his lovely ex-wife Adrienne.<br>
She was trained as a school-teacher and specialist in Religious Education; he was an Oxford graduate in Religious Philosophy. The two of them share a life-long interest in three main areas of study: <span style="color:#BFFF40">Cannabis</span>, Yoga and <span style="color:#FF4040">Scientology</span>, and they have been active in a number of important breakthroughs in each subject.

2011 article: NZ bans UK couple over Scientology case <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/editors-picks/4957718/NZ-bans-UK-couple-over-Scientology-case" class="postlink">http://www.stuff.co.nz/editors-picks/49 ... ology-case</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A British man who failed to disclose that he was deported from Denmark after "industrial espionage" against the Church of Scientology has been refused permission to settle in New Zealand.<br>
<br>
Oxford University-educated Robin Scott, 62, and his wife Adrienne, 61, a teacher, left their Canterbury organic farmlet in March after the Immigration and Protection Tribunal turned down their appeal against a direction that they had to leave the country. In visitor and work visa applications from 2005, the couple disclosed that they had both served prison sentences in Britain in the 1990s for growing cannabis that they said would help research into the medicinal use of the drug.<br>
<br>
However, four years later, they revealed to New Zealand authorities for the first time that Mr Scott had served a month in a Danish prison before being deported in 1984. He later agreed he faced a criminal charge but said it was essentially a civil dispute over "industrial espionage"....As well as Mrs Scott's teaching, Mr Scott worked in finance management and accounting in Christchurch, and both supported holistic health practices including yoga.</div></blockquote>

In 1973 Scott joined the Church of Scientology’s elite Sea Organisation, and worked full-time for eight years, latterly as a senior executive in the UK and at their international headquarters in Florida. <a href="https://www.lifetech.org.uk/product/the-significance-of-scientology/" class="postlink">https://www.lifetech.org.uk/product/the ... ientology/</a><br>
<br>
Sea Org <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Org" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Org</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Sea Organization (also known as the Sea Org)[3] is a Scientology organization, which the Church of Scientology describes as a "fraternal religious order, comprising the church's most dedicated members".[4] All Scientology management organizations are controlled exclusively by members of the Sea Org.[5] David Miscavige, the de facto leader of Scientology, is the highest-ranking Sea Org officer, holding the rank of captain.<br>
<br>
The Sea Org has been described as a paramilitary organization[7] and as a private naval force,[8] having operated several vessels in its past and displaying a maritime tradition. Some ex-members and scholars have described the Sea Org as a totalitarian organization marked by intensive surveillance and a lack of freedom.[9] The Sea Org has also been compared to a monastic organization..The Sea Org was established on August 12, 1967, by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Dianetics and Scientology, initially on board three ships, the Diana, the Athena, and the Apollo, with the latter serving as flagship.[12]<br>
<br>
In 1971, the Sea Org assumed responsibility for the church's ecclesiastical development, and in particular the delivery of the upper levels of its auditing and training, known as the Operating Thetan or "OT" levels.[13] In 1981, under the aegis of the Commodore's Messenger Organization led by David Miscavige, the Sea Org dissolved the <span style="color:#80BF00">Guardian's Office</span> (GO) and assumed full responsibility for the church's international management, later reassigning the GO's duties to the Office of Special Affairs in 1983 during the corporate restructuring of the Church.. According to Hubbard, much of the galaxy, including Earth (known as "Teegeeack"), was ruled tens of millions of years ago by the <span style="color:#00FF80">Galactic Confederacy</span>...
</div></blockquote>

Galactic Confederacy?   Now who talks about the Galactic Federation?  Oh yeah... Sacha Stone, Robert David Steele, Charlie Ward and Simon Parkes (who has an alien mother apparently)...<br>
<br>
Spooks I tell yah, they're nuts....</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Church of Scientology in Denmark were granted a court order by a Scottish judge yesterday banning six former members of their church who formed a breakaway group from publishing or divulging to anyone copies of "secret scriptures" alleged to have been stolen from the church in Copenhagen.<br>
<br>
Lord Cameron, at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, granted interim interdict to the church after hearing that two of the group, Mr Robin Scott and his wife, Adrienne, and others had set up a rival organisation to the Scientologists, known as the Advanced Ability Centre...<br>
<br>
The court heard that in 1983 the Scotts bought <span style="color:#FFFF40">Candacraig House, Strathdon, Aberdeenshire</span>, with the intention of turning it into a centre where scientology courses were provided, outwith the organisation of the Church of Scientology. The other members of the breakaway group in the case live at Candacraig and help to provide these courses...<br>
<br>
The court was told by Mr James Drummond Young, counsel for the church, that another two former members, Ron Lawley and Morag Bellmaine, called at the church's office in Copenhagen dressed in the uniform of high officers of the Church of Scientology.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Originally built in the 17th century, Candacraig was enlarged in the Scottish Baronial style with its pepper pot turrets and crow stepped dormer windows by the Aberdeen architect ‘Tudor Johnny’ Smith in 1836. Extended at the turn of the 20th century, the house was partially reconstructed in 1955 by local architect Alexander McKenzie, whilst retaining its traditional Scottish style.<br>
<br>
The Lairdship of Candacraig was officially granted to the Anderson family in 1620 and the estate remained with that family for 10 generations until it was sold in 1866 to Sir Charles Forbes. In 1900 it was purchased by Andrew Wallace, whose descendents owned Candacraig until 1980. More recently the house was owned by <span style="color:#FF4080">Gordon and Anita Roddick, founders of the Bodyshop chain</span>. They undertook a comprehensive program of improvement before selling it to <span style="color:#FF40BF">Billy Connolly and Pamela Stephenson in 1998</span>. Candacraig attracted much media attention, as Hollywood celebrities became regular guests. The Connolly duo acquired the walled garden and courtyard cottages restoring Candacraig's privacy - so much a part of its unique appeal.</div></blockquote>
