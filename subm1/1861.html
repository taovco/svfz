<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The organization has roots in Denver, Colorado, where in 1887 Frances Wisebart Jacobs, along with other religious leaders, began the <span style="color:#FFFF00">Charity Organization Society,</span> which coordinated services between Jewish and Christian charities and fundraising for 22 agencies... The first Community Chest was founded in 1913 in Cleveland, Ohio,[3] after the example of the Jewish Federation in Cleveland—which served as an exemplary model for "federated giving".<br>
<br>
In May 2009, United Way of America and United Way International were integrated as one global entity, United Way Worldwide<br>
<br>
After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the United Way of Western Connecticut was criticized by some victims' family members for a lack of transparency in fundraising. ..</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_Organization_Society" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_O ... on_Society</a> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Charity Organization Societies were founded in England in 1869 following the 'Goschen Minute' .. Charity Organization Societies were made up of charitable groups that used scientific philanthropy to help poor, distressed or deviant persons. The Societies considered themselves more than just alms givers. Their ultimate goal was to restore as much self-sufficiency and responsibility as an individual could manage....The COS was resented by the poor for its harshness, and its acronym was rendered by critics as "Cringe or Starve".<br>
<br>
The Charity Organization Society can be compared to the <span style="color:#FF8040">settlement house movement</span> which emphasized social reform rather than personal problems as the proper focus of charity.... The Charity Organisation Society was renamed Family Welfare Association in 1946 and still operates today as Family Action, a registered family support charity.</div></blockquote>

Scientific Charity Movement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Charity_Movement" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientifi ... y_Movement</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Scientific Charity Movement was a movement that arose in the early 1870s in the United States to stop poverty. It sought to move the role of supporting the impoverished away from government and religious organizations and into the hands of <span style="color:#FFFF00">Charity Organization Societies (COS)</span>. These Societies claimed the altruistic goals of lifting the poor out of poverty through the means of education and employment, and did make some strides to help young children involved in immoral underaged labor practices. However when it came to the COS's treatment of the "defective class" as they were labeled (insane, feeble-minded, blind, crippled, maimed, deaf and dumb, epileptic, criminal types, prostitutes, drug addicts, and alcoholics), the Scientific Charity Movement's other goals based in the popular post civil war <span style="color:#FF4040">social scientific theories of eugenics and social Darwinism</span> came to light. Many of these "defective classes" were moved from the streets and into insane asylums where they were often experimented on by scientists of the time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Invention of Casework</span><br>
<br>
The idea and procedure of impoverished family “cases” and “casework” was established under the Scientific Charity Movement.<span style="color:#FF4040"> Using the ideas of eugenics</span> and the new technique of in-depth investigation and interviews as a means of social control, caseworkers were tasked with sorting through and categorizing impoverished people into two separate classes.<br>
<br>
In July 2016, Jeff Kaufman wrote a blog post comparing elements of the Scientific Charity Movement to those of <span style="color:#FFFF00">effective altruism</span>, a more recent movement that also applies a scientific mindset to charity.<br>
<br>

One of the most powerful branches of United Way America is from King County with Seattle as its capital.  This branch is deeply connected with William Gates Sr. and the Seattle movers and shakers and Planned Parenthood .... See: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1835" class="postlink"><em class="text-italics"><span style="color:#FFBF40">Bill Gates Sr. was behind the purchase of Starbucks. Story leads to Castle Rock WA and an old CIA case..</span></em></a><br>

Kaufman, <em class="text-italics">Scientific Charity Movement</em> in Effective Altruism Forum <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/z7s23jiFLF7B3JNT8/scientific-charity-movement" class="postlink">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/pos ... y-movement</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The movement today is generally seen as having failed. The overhead in evaluating applicants is enormous, people don't like "friendly visitors" coming into their houses to investigate them, and the whole idea of deciding who is deserving has become distasteful. Plus their support of eugenics...<br>
<br>
With their emphasis on applying science and reason to charity they sound a lot like today's effective altruists, but their beliefs about what we should do are vastly different. Scientific charity (SC) tried to prioritize based on deservingness, while effective altruism (EA) tries to prioritize based on who will be helped more. These aren't completely disconnected: in the SC view helping an undeserving person would just encourage them to be less responsible, so they were kind of prioritizing based on how much they thought they could help people.

I have wondered if the idea of putting missing children pictures on milk cartons originated from the milk wells of the settlement movement.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_movement" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_movement</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The movement started in 1884 with the founding of Toynbee Hall in Whitechapel, in the East End of London... There is also a global network, The International Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers (IFS). [United Nations connected <a href="https://ifsnetwork.org/" class="postlink">https://ifsnetwork.org/</a>]<br>
<br>
The most famous settlement house in the United States is Chicago's Hull House, founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889 after Addams visited Toynbee Hall within the previous two years. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">Bohemian immigrant youth at the Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House in 1918 in East St. Louis, Illinois.  Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House is a United Way organization and is a United Methodist settlement house operating 22 programs at five sites in the Metro East St. Louis Metro East </em> <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/xdt0kj.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
When I first encountered the folder, I presumed IKS was one of over a hundred organizations in the New York City area that Federation had funded during the 20th Century. I had seen appearances of the Kaufmann surname in various other parts of the collection and I knew that FJP of New York funded the<span style="color:#00FF40"> Henry Kaufmann Campgrounds</span>, a group of day camps with locations in Rockland County, Suffolk County, and Staten Island, which are still in operation today.<br>

</div></blockquote>

American settlement houses functioned on a philosophy of<span style="color:#FFFF00"> "scientific philanthropy"</span>, a belief that instead of giving direct relief, charities should give resources to the poor so they could break out of the circle of poverty. American charity workers feared that the deeply entrenched social class system in Europe would develop in the United States.<br>
<br>
Settlement houses influenced urban design and architecture in the twentieth century. For example, James Rossant of Conklin + Rossant agreed with Robert E. Simon's social vision and consciously sought to mix economic backgrounds when drawing up the master plan for Reston, Virginia.[13] The New Monastic movement has a similar goal and model.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Henry Kaufmann Campgrounds was established in 1953 when the then called UJA Federation of Jewish Philanthropies was interested in merging all Jewish Community Centers under one banner...primarily through the vision of Graenum Berger (Director of Communal Planning at the UJA-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies after World War II) and through a $1 million contribution from the Henry Kaufmann Foundation.<br>
<br>
The first HKC Board, chaired by Mildred Goetz, contributed to HKC in a very hands-on way, applying real estate, construction, brokerage, legal and money management experience to purchase the initial property of 30 acres of Staten Island land at an auction, expanding it further over the years. Fred Rose, James Felt Leo Oppenheimer, Maurice Hexter and Joe Willen all played pivotal roles in the development of HKC.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This was a new place — and a new concept — for inner-city children whose only experience with recreational programs consisted of often overcrowded amenities like community centers, rented vacant lots, schools or public parks. Polio was on the rise at the time, and parents who lived in the city wanted their children to leave the hot summer streets behind for a healthier, rural environment.<br>
<br>
Still, much about Camp Kaufmann remains a mystery, even to some native Staten Islanders, who often confuse it with the nearby William H. Pouch Camp. (Pouch, owned by the Boy Scouts of America, is currently New York City’s only Boy Scout camp, sits on a separate parcel of land that adjacent to the Kaufmann site.)<br>
<br>
As the Henry Kaufmann Campgrounds program expanded, the camp began hosting events for local police groups, firehouses and churches. It recognized a growing need to develop programs for special needs children — a priority that Coopersmith says has always existed, and always will.<br>
<br>
“It’s a hidden gem,” he says, “that will be kept in perpetuity.”</div></blockquote>

EDDIE CANTOR AND SUMMER CAMP <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Camping can play an important part of the formation of a personality and now we even have news from the Jewish Voice that  Bob Dylan became who he is (including a soon-to-become recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom) due to the time he spent at Camp Herzl, the Jewish summer camp in Wisconsin.,..Another entertainer (though not a prophet,  a mystic or a poet), who owed a lot to the Jewish summer camp experience was Eddie Cantor—comedian, actor and singer, famous from the 1930s to the 1950s. Eddie Cantor initiated the “March of Dimes” fundraising campaign against polio,... he became an ardent supporter of Jewish camping in general and of the  summer camp he attended as a child, Surprise Lake Camp, run by the<span style="color:#FFFF00"> Educational Alliance.</span><br>
<br>
Orphaned at birth and raised by his grandmother, Cantor was able to avail himself of the camping services due to the program of scholarships awarded to children from poor families by the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This is one of those trails where the websites lead you round and round in circles , so you know that you're dealing, or at least highly suspect, your dealing with the deep state..<br>
<br>
Under philanthropy, Kidco supports March of Dimes: <a href="https://www.kidco.com/about-us/philanthropy/" class="postlink">https://www.kidco.com/about-us/philanthropy/</a> The organization was founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, to combat polio. The name "March of Dimes" was coined by Eddie Cantor. After funding Jonas Salk's polio vaccine, the organization expanded its focus to the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality.'..<br>
<br>
In 2009, the March of Dimes partnered with the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the World Health Organization (RHR/WHO) to publish a white paper on the global and regional toll of preterm birth worldwide.
