			<div class="content">The Rosicrucians were a secret society which allegedly existed around the 16th and 17th centuries. While its existence is dubious and possibly legendary, the principles behind it are not, and the rosicrucian phenomenon spawned more secret societies which claimed to be the legitimate successors of the original rosicrucians, if not the originals themselves. Their area of study and inspiration were philosophy, alchemy, magic, hermetism, brahmanism, kabbalah, and eastern mysticism. They claimed to possess an<em class="text-italics"> ageless wisdom or prisca theologia</em>, revealed by God himself to man at an earlier time, which degenerated into the multiple religions we have today, which they consider idolatrous and partially correct. Their purpose was to lead humanity into a <em class="text-italics">new age</em> of spirituality. Its founder is the legendary Christian Rosenkreuz, a powerful alchemist, magician, miracle worker and wise man who learned from the mystics of the Orient. Among the members of the rosicrucian movement were Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, Robert Fludd, Galileo, Benjamin Franklin and many other prominent members.<br>
<br>
Let's see a few works by rosicrucians and find out if they have a pattern in common.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">VIA LUCIS</strong><br>
<br>
Written by Comenius, it is a treatise on <strong class="text-strong">the enlightenment of all humanity through education, upbringing and illustration</strong>, <strong class="text-strong">the people as co-workers of God</strong> called to strive for this light", to work<strong class="text-strong"> "to improve the ecclesiastical and political order", and so "the arrival of a just and perfect age</strong>", the Kingdom of Christ. For this enlightenment of the world, Comenius offers the path of pansophy (omniscience or omniscience), which makes use of all previous inventions and discoveries, including those of seafaring and printing. For international exchange, according to Comenius, <strong class="text-strong">"a new world language"</strong> must be written that is better and more versatile than Latin. <strong class="text-strong">"Scholars of all peoples should participate in this global reform"</strong>, their activities should be "coordinated by a Collegium of Light (Collegium Lucis) <strong class="text-strong">based in London</strong>". <br>
<br>
"In his vision of the future, just world, he ties in with <strong class="text-strong">Old Testament promises of the future kingdom of peace</strong>. He writes: Then there will be universal peace all over the world. The hostilities will be lifted on all sides, but also the reasons for this hostility, the disagreements among people. For there will be nothing to disagree about once everyone sees the same truths clearly. ... The peoples will <strong class="text-strong">turn their swords into plowshares</strong> and their spears into sickles. No nation will lift up the sword against the other, and they will no longer learn to wage war".<br>
<br>
A future, scientifically-oriented utopia, with a world united according to messianic prophecy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">NEW ATLANTIS</strong><br>
<br>
The novel depicts a mythical island,<strong class="text-strong"> Bensalem</strong>, in the Pacific Ocean somewhere west of<strong class="text-strong"> Peru</strong>.  The interlocutors include the governor of the House of Strangers, Joabin the Jew, and the Head of Salomon's House.  The center of the story is the state-sponsored scientific institution, Salomon's House, "which ... is the very <strong class="text-strong">eye</strong> of this kingdom."<br>
<br>
the Salomon's House, to which order <em class="text-italics">"God of heaven and earth had vouchsafed the grace to know the works of Creation, and the secrets of them", as well as "to discern between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures and illusions of all sorts"</em>; and a series of instruments, process and methods of scientific research that were employed in the island by the Salomon's House. The goal of this ideal college is "<em class="text-italics">the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible"</em>. To understand and conquer nature, and to apply the collected knowledge to the betterment of society. It is suggested that Solomon's House is the top authority in Bensalem.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"And this we do also: we have consultations, which of the inventions and experiences which we have discovered shall be published, and which not; and take all an oath of secrecy for the concealing of those which we think fit to keep secret; though some of those we do reveal sometime to the State, and some not."</div></blockquote>

Bensalem is also called "the virgin of the world" because of its morality; an epithet which alludes to Sophia, goddess of wisdom, which was also Minerva and Athena. The goddess is a symbol for many things; wisdom, but also the divine feminine, the receptive material principle of nature, the natural order, the illusion of materiality, etc. Isis is called by Blavatsky the "virgin of the world". This island is christian in religion due to a miraculous apparition of christian texts.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">GEORGIA GUIDESTONES</strong><br>
<br>
A sculpture erected by "R.C. Christian" (Christian Rosenkreuz) which a few guidelines for humanity<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">Guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">Unite humanity with a living new language.<br>
Rule passion — faith — tradition — and all things with tempered reason.</strong><br>
Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.<br>
Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in<strong class="text-strong"> a world court</strong>.<br>
Avoid petty laws and useless officials.<br>
Balance personal rights with<strong class="text-strong"> social duties.</strong><br>
Prize truth — beauty — love — seeking harmony with the infinite.<br>
Be not a cancer on the Earth — Leave room for nature — <strong class="text-strong">Leave room for nature.</strong><br>
<br>
Let these be guidestones to an <strong class="text-strong">Age of Reason</strong><br>
<br>
I'll translate it for you: Control population and depopulate more than 90% of humanity (from 7 billion to 500 million people). Guide reproduction by eugenics according to what the state deems desirable. Create a one world language, replacing the others. Let the state rule passions, religions and traditions according to the "reason" of the elite of experts. Create a one world government with a world court. Enforce "social duties"; meaning a collectivist regime. Enforce the ecologist agenda to live in harmony.<br>
<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
The symbol of the rosicrucians is the rosy cross; a cross with a red rose in the middle, possibly representing the soul or divine spark trapped in matter. <br>
<br>
Is this the reason why the one of the emblems of socialism is a red rose?<br>
<br>
The ideas of Bacon's work are considered to have inspired the creation of a utopian project, which was meant to be the beginning of a new age on Earth, with a perfect system of government that would eventually spread throughout the world. The name of this "New Atlantis"? <strong class="text-strong">The United States of America.</strong></div>
