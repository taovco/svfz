<strong class="text-strong">UN SECRETARY GENERALS OVERWHELMINGLY LEFTISTS</strong><br>
<br>
Take a look at the Secretary Generals of the UN throughout the years. You'll notice a pattern.<br>

<ul><li>Gladwyn Jebb: Member of the British Liberal party (center left)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Trygve Lie: "<span style="color:#FF0080">A socialist from an early age, Lie once met Vladimir Lenin while on a Labour Party visit to Moscow and gave permission for Leon Trotsky to settle in Norway after he was exiled from the Soviet Union</span>. However, because of pressure from Joseph Stalin, he forced Trotsky to leave the country". He was also member of the Labour Party. Its logo is the red rose (the symbol for social democracy and international socialism).</li></ul>

<ul><li>Dag Hammarskjöld: No info on this one. Died in a plane "accident"...</li></ul>

<ul><li>U Thant: Here's<a href="https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=wGIRXAu7xmwC&amp;pg=PA464&amp;lpg=PA464&amp;dq=U+Thant+praised+Vladimir+I.+Lenin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZVoRztjALs&amp;sig=ACfU3U22QlblcuEhzwzoJKFh1_uolaJ7sQ&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi15p3ep-ruAhVBHLkGHVhZD5gQ6AEwA3oECAIQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=U%20Thant%20praised%20Vladimir%20I.%20Lenin&amp;f=false" class="postlink">https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=wG ... in&amp;f=false</a> <span style="color:#FF00FF">U Thant praising Lenin and saying the United Nations is in line with his ideals of "peace and peaceful coexistence" </span>(quite the opposite of his regime)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Kurt Waldheim:<span style="color:#FF40FF"> Surprisingly, this man belonged to the Nazi (or National Socialist) regime. This shows how little the "Allies" abhorred the "crimes" of nazism. They had zero issues with a former nazi intelligence officer being secretary general of the UN. </span>The war against Germany was NEVER about stopping "atrocities". Take a look at this "Waldheim ran for Secretary-General of the United Nations in the 1971 selection. Waldheim was supported by the Soviet Union and led the first two rounds of voting. However, he was opposed by China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Waldheim won an accidental victory in the third round of voting when those three permanent members failed to coordinate their vetoes and all abstained". Really? The world powers didn't discuss anything between themselves, and there were no repercussions, they just sat down and dealt with it? Give me a break.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Javier Pérez de Cuéllar: This man founded a nationalist party in Perú. However, he was a member of the Club of Madrid, which seeks to "strengthen democracy throughout the world" and he was given a medal of the "Four Freedoms", inspired by FDR's speech (FDR, as I'll show, was one of the worst presidencies of the United States and worked in favor of communism).</li></ul>

<ul><li>Boutros Boutros-Ghali: He was a member of the <span style="color:#FF40FF">Arab Socialist party</span>. As if that weren't enough, he was accused by journalist Linda Melvern of having aided the Rwandan genocide, carried out by the bantus. If you want to know what the bantus are like, ask Cognitive dissident... In his work <em class="text-italics">An Agenda for Peace</em>,  he suggested distinct definitions for peacemaking and peacekeeping, and referenced Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to <strong class="text-strong">justify military involvement without the consent of both parties</strong></li></ul>

<ul><li>Kofi Annan: Chariman of the Elders, an organization founded by<span style="color:#FF0040"> left-wing anti-white terrorist, knight of Malta, philo-semite Nelson Mandela, openly praised Rockefeller and got a scholarship by the Ford Foundation </span>(both organizations supported eugenics, the UN and the Council on Foreign relations).</li></ul>

<ul><li>Ban Ki Moon: <span style="color:#40FF00">Supported the democratic party's Green New Deal</span>.  He refused to condemn the death penalty imposed on Saddam Hussein by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking, "The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide". Ban's statements contradicted long-standing United Nations opposition to the death penalty as a human-rights concern. Remember that the Gulf War and the whole saddam Hussein affair were carried out by the Bush; the whole intervention seeked to bring about "a new world order". <span style="color:#FF4000">The child abuse scandal by UN "peacekeepers" hapened during his term. The United States and other member states criticized the UN leadership for seeming to spend more efforts on discrediting whistleblower Anders Kompass for disclosing the sexual abuses rather than on holding the abusers themselves accountable for their crimes.</span> On 22 June 2015, after much criticism in the media, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed an independent panel to investigate the matter. The UN panel cleared Anders Kompass from any wrongdoing and concluded that he did indeed have the authority to share the information in the report with the French authorities. The panel also found that the concerns of risks to the victims by including their identities in the report had been largely exaggerated. On 8 June 2016, Kompass announced his resignation from the United Nations, citing "<span style="color:#FF4040">the complete impunity for those who have been found to have, in various degrees, abused their authority, together with the unwillingness of the hierarchy to express any regrets for the way they acted towards me</span>".</li></ul>

<ul><li>António Guterres: <span style="color:#FF0040">This individual was the head of the International Socialist, an organization which in 1962 stated that their goal was "nothing less than world government" by "strengthening the United Nations"</span>, he was also part of the Portuguese Socialist party, and head of the UN refugee comission. He did oppose President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, which is nice. He made comments on how COVID shows how patriarchy and capitalism are to blame <a href="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/08/02/32898088-8707897-image-a-8_1599527383642.jpg" class="postlink">https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/08 ... 383642.jpg</a>.</li></ul>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>United Nations projections indicate that over the next 50 years, <span style="color:#FFBF00">the populations of virtually all countries of Europe as well as Japan will face population decline and population ageing.</span> The new challenges of declining and ageing populations will require comprehensive reassessments of many established policies and programmes, including those relating to international migration.<br>
<br>
Focusing on these two striking and critical population trends, the report<span style="color:#00BFFF"> considers replacement migration for eight low-fertility countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and United States) and two regions (Europe and the European Union). Replacement migration refers to the international migration that a country would need to offset population decline and population ageing resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.</span></div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">SECRETS OF THE UN FLAG</strong><br>
<br>
The UN flag has the world divided into 33 sectors, flanked by two olive branches with 13 leaves. This is very likely an allusion to the number 33 in esotericism; 33 degrees in the Scottish Rite, 33 vertebrae through which the kundalini must rise, 33 vedic gods, 33 years of the life of Christ, 33 elements in the kabbalistic tree of life, etc. The number thirteen can represent the 13th degree, the 13 degrees in the York rite, the 12 signs of the zodiac and the sun, the 13 colonies, the 13 parts of the body of Osiris (not counting the missing part), the thirteen steps in the pyramid of the dollar bill, etc.<br>
<br>
It was designed by people with ties to communism<br>

<strong class="text-strong">THE UN DOES NOT PUT ALL NATIONS ON EQUAL GROUNDS</strong><br>
<br>
It is said the UN has all nations discussing in equal terms, giving every nation a voice in international affairs (which may not even concern them). But the truth is that five nations (US, UK, France, China and Russia) have veto power over the decisions of any other. In practice, it allows these nations to excercise geopolitical control over the entire world under the guise of diplomacy, dialogue, peacekeeping and humanitarianism.<br>
<br>

<br>
The United Nations is nothing other than an attempt to take over the world and impose a totalitarian, socialist regime. Share this with other people; people you trust, people who are suspicious of the UN, but can't put their finger on what's wrong. Save this evidence in your folder, post it online, discuss it, add your own. This has to be in the mainstream. Abolish the UN.</div>
