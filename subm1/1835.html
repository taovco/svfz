There is an old court case that involves a teacher name Eugene Ray Clegg from CASTLE ROCK, WA who taught at MERCER Island High School and was charged in Pakistan for gun running in 1982. <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00552R000201240003-1.pdf" class="postlink">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom ... 0003-1.pdf</a><br>

According to the 1984 CIA document, the former  Castle Rock School teacher told the court that US officials asked him to smuggle guns to Pakistan.  Apparently Clegg taught Science at Mercer Island High School while awaiting the outcome of the case.<br>
<br>
What?? A school hires an alleged arms runner during his trial?  I looked for further stuff on Mercer Island High School and found that Obama's mother attended there. Just another coincidence I'm sure.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Hope Heart Institute was founded in 1959 on a figurative shoestring and a literal prayer, in a collaboration between a young Seattle heart surgeon and a Catholic nun. The surgeon was Lester R. Sauvage (1926-2015), a newly minted member of the cardiovascular team at what was then Providence Hospital. The nun was Sister Genevieve (1887-1963), the Seattle hospital’s administrator...<br>
<br>
IIn 1980, Sauvage launched a campaign to raise $30 million to transform what had once been a one-person operation into one of the world’s leading heart research institutes. ..Bob Hope (1903-2003), arguably the best-known entertainer in the world at that time, agreed to lend his name to the cause. Accordingly, Sauvage announced that the center would be renamed the Bob Hope International Heart Research Institute. Kakkar, the prominent London physician, would serve as its director.<br>

PATH is an international, nonprofit global health organization based in Seattle, with 1,600 employees in more than 70+ offices around the world. Its president and CEO is Steve Davis....Gordon W. Perkin is the founder of Program for Appropriate Technology in Health. In 1968 (at least) he worked at the Ford Foundation as a program advisor in their Thailand and Regional Southeast Asia (Bangkok) department.

[2] In 2001 he was director of the global health program of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation...."In 1995, Perkin was approached by Bill Gates Sr., who was seeking advice and information on family planning issues for his son's new philanthropic outlet, the Gates Foundation. Perkin offered his thoughts but also told the Gateses about the growing crisis in childhood immunizations. He didn't ask Gates for money or for a job.<br>

PATH was one of the first agencies to address the problem of AIDS in developing countries, starting in 1987 with a project aimed at increasing condom use by sex workers in Thailand. In the past decade, PATH has managed AIDS projects in over 35 countries...</div></blockquote>

Planned Parenthood Seattle:
</div></blockquote>

There was a huge scandal back in the 1980s or 90s that ties some of your various Seattle persons of interest together quite a few years ago: United Way -- one of the largest charitable organizations in the city, which all the major employers like Boeing used to pressure their employees to contribute to, and match their contributions -- was busted for funding Planned Parenthood/abortions. I believe Gates Sr. sat on the boards of both United Way and Planned Parenthood.<br>

Knight was a judge of the Superior Court in Los Angeles beginning in 1935. He was reelected in 1936 and 1942 without significant opposition. His case load varied from the glamorous to the mundane. He oversaw weddings and divorces for Hollywood starlets.<br>

In 1964, Knight endorsed Nelson Rockefeller for the Republican nomination against Barry Goldwater. ..On May 22, 1970, Knight died three months after his daughter Carolyn Knight Weedman committed suicide. She took her life by carbon monoxide asphyxiation from her car in the garage of her home on Lillian Way in Hancock Park and left behind two sons, Jonathan and Robert Weedman.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Former United States Senate Candidate, John Meier (also known as John H. Meier and Johnny Meier), is best known for his involvement with Howard Hughes, Watergate, the Environment, and the notable Awards he has received throughout the world. He was born September 28, 1933 in New York. <br>
The book<span style="text-decoration:underline"> <span style="color:#FF0040">Age of Secrets: The Conspiracy that Toppled Richard Nixon and the Hidden Death of Howard Hughes</span></span>, was written about Meier. He has been friends with many powerful people including leaders of countries, some of the world’s wealthiest individuals, and celebrities.<br>
<br>
Called a “mystery man”, Meier has led such an incredibly complex life that the Las Vegas Sun stated that a movie on his life would be “much more exciting and bizarre” then one on Howard Hughes. Meier City Pictures is developing film and television productions based on John Meier's life story. Meier has appeared in over a thousand newspaper and magazine articles as well as books, radio and television interviews and he is mentioned in many government and historical records forever preserved at the United States National Archives.  President of the United States Richard Nixon talks about Meier on several reels of the Nixon White House Tapes.<br>
<br>
He was considered the #2 man in the Hughes organization, at the time Hughes was the wealthiest man in the world, and was Vice Chairman of the Humphrey-Muskie National Finance Committee, during Vice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey’s Presidential Campaign. Meier served on President Richard Nixon’s Task Force on Resources and Environment, and was a Special Consultant to Nixon’s Environmental Quality Advisory Committee. He has been an advisor to several United States Senators including Senators Hubert Humphrey and Robert F. Kennedy. ...<br>
<br>
Meier had top secret security clearance with the United States Government, initially from his position in the Hughes Organization and later from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and he was an operative with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) under the cover name John Ross. Meier was responsible for the CIA’s creation of the legal term Glomar Response, when an agency refuses to confirm or deny the existence of records or information. He has been a major source to the media, including America’s top investigative reporter, Jack Anderson...<br>
<br>
He produced several motion pictures through such companies as Meier - Murray Productions, including Bury Me an Angel which inspired the “roaring rampage of revenge” line referenced by Uma Thurman in Quentin Tarantino’s 2004 film Kill Bill Vol. 2, and was<span style="color:#FFFF00"> a Member of the Child Welfare Advisory Committee (which Hughes and Governor Laxalt set up)</span>, a Member of the Impact Priority Committee, Member of the Las Vegas Council for American Society for Public Administration, Member of the Las Vegas Rotary International Rotary Club, Member-at-large of the Board of Directors for the Frontier Council Girl Scouts of America, Member of the League of Women Voters of the United States’ Mens’ Finance Advisory Committee, Member of the American Industrial Development Council, was a Vice Chairman of the March of Dimes, and was on the Board of Directors of the California Educational Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to the training of emotionally disturbed and brain-damaged children, whose President was Robert Sweeney and which the board of advisors included Andy Griffith, Jim Nabors, and Dick Van Dyke.... <br>
He was the founder of Radiarc Industries Inc

Mr. Meier has recently been contacted by the Canadian Government informing him U.S. Officials have requested an interview with Mr. Meier regarding his knowledge of the Gay’s, Howard Hughes and Hughes Medical in regards to Bain Capital.<br>
<br>
Robert Gay is the son of William Gay. William Gay was part of a coup that took control of the Hughes Corporation.  Robert’s uncle is, Dr. Wilbur Thain the brother-in-law of William Gay, one of Howard Hughes last physicians who kept Howard Hughes drugged the last years of Howard Hughes life. Thain was from Logan, Utah and brought in to supply drugs to Hughes, which he did until Hughes' death.  Thain was later indicted by a federal grand jury on federal drug conspiracy charges...<br>
<br>
Robert Gay is a former Bain Capital partner of Mitt Romney’s. It has been reported that the Gay’s stole billions of dollars from Hughes Medical and some of the stolen funds were pumped into Bain Capital in the form of derivatives.</div></blockquote></div>
