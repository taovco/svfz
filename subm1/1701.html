<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Somebody Up There Likes Me is a 1956 American drama film directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman and Pier Angeli, based on the life of middleweight boxing legend Rocky Graziano..In the plot - Rocky Graziano (Paul Newman) has a difficult childhood and is beaten by his father. He joins a street gang, and undergoes a long history of criminal activities...He serves a year in a <em class="text-italics">United States Disciplinary Barracks</em>, and resumes his career as a boxer as a result.</div></blockquote>

The United States Disciplinary Barracks (or USDB, popularly known as Leavenworth, or the DB) is a military correctional facility[2] located on <span style="color:#FFFF40">Fort Leavenworth</span>, a United States Army post in Kansas.<br>
<br>
We have a number of posts regarding that facility including : <span style="color:#BF80FF">Michael Aquino - Absent from Pizzagate Convo...Why?</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2366555" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2366555</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The US Army received allegations of child abuse at fifteen of its day care centers and several elementary schools. There were also at least two other cases at Air Force day care centers, and another one at a center run by the US Navy. In addition to these, a special team of experts were sent to Panama to help determine if as many as ten children at a Department of Defense elementary school were molested and possibly infected with AIDS. Another case also emerged in a US-run facility in West Germany. These cases occurred at some of the most esteemed military bases in the country, including Fort Dix, <span style="color:#FFFF40">Fort Leavenworth</span>, Fort Jackson, and West Point. In the West Point case alone, by the end of the year, fifty children were interviewed by investigators. There were reports of satanic acts, animal sacrifices, and cult-like behavior among the abusers. An investigation led by former US Attorney Rudolph Giuliani produced no federal grand jury indictments. His investigation concluded that only one or two children were abused, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary.

Actor Gets 5 Million Saudi Gift for Ill Children - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171103174027/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/06/us/actor-gets-5-million-saudi-gift-for-ill-children.html" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20171103174 ... ldren.html</a><br>

 <blockquote class="uncited"><div>Saudi Arabia has made a $5 million gift to the actor Paul Newman to help establish a camp in Connecticut for critically ill children.<br>
<br>
Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, announced the award yesterday at a news conference in Washington, saying the gift came from King Fahd and the people of Saudi Arabia. But he also paid tribute to a young Saudi businessman for initially calling attention to Mr. Newman's plans for the camp. The ambassador then proposed the gift and his Government agreed. <br>
<br>
 The idea for the gift came from Khaled Alhegelan, a 25-year-old Saudi who has thalassemia, an inherited chronic anemia, which has required him since childhood to be hospitalized every three weeks to receive a blood transfusion.<br>
<br>
He learned about the planned camp a few weeks ago, Mr. Alhegelan said in a telephone interview from Washington, where he attended the news conference. He said he was impressed by the idea that it would give children with cancer or other life-threatening diseases a chance to enjoy what he called ''a life away from hospitals in a challenging environment.'' He immediately got in touch with Mr. Newman. 'Hole in Wall Gang Camp' <br>
<br>
 The actor is providing $4 million from the profits of his salad dressing business to the camp, a simulated rustic Western village with log cabins, corrals, a music hall and a saloon with swinging doors. He calls it the ''Hole in the Wall Gang Camp,'' after the gang of outlaws in one of Mr. Newman's movies, ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.''<br>
<br>
The camp, on a forested 300-acre site in northeastern Connecticut, will be staffed partly by physicians from Yale University Medical School who will work as volunteers and by nurses from Yale-New Haven Hospital and will be equipped to treat children undergoing chemotherapy. There will be no fee for campers. The camp is to open in 1988 and when fully operative, will offer eight two-week sessions. ..</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>James Gunn's PG Porn is a web series created by brothers James Gunn, <span style="color:#FF0040">Brian Gunn</span>, and Sean Gunn. It consists of a series of pornography spoofs, with a humorous event occurring just before the supposed commencement of pornographic sexual acts. Each episode pairs a mainstream actor with a pornographic actress or model. The tagline is, "For people who love everything about Porn...except the sex."<br>
<br>
..According to Gunn, the idea was developed in the early 2000s, before short-term Internet-based sketch comedies became popular. Stephen Blackehart of The Good Boys Productions produced the show with Jake Zim and Peter Safran of Safran Digital Group (SDG) for Spike.com.

<br>
The Sisters of St. Joseph of Savannah were established at Savannah in 1867, in charge of the boys' orphanage, and soon afterward became an independent diocesan congregation. In 1876 the orphanage was transferred to Washington, Georgia, and with it the mother-house of the congregation. In 1912 the Sisters opened an academy for women in Augusta which became Mount Saint Joseph. They eventually moved the mother house to Augusta, Georgia. In 1922 the Sisters voted to incorporate themselves into the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, becoming the Augusta Province and became part of the St. Louis Province in 1961.<br>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Menendez Murdered Mob Style : Killers Intended to Send a ‘Message,’ Police Source Says  </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-08-30-me-1259-story.html" class="postlink">https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm ... story.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife were murdered in their Beverly Hills mansion in a fashion typical of mob-style executions, informed law enforcement sources said Tuesday.<br>
<br>
“It was definitely a message killing,” said a source familiar with the slayings. “There’s no question it’s organized crime.”..<br>
<br>
Menendez and his wife were found slain by their two college-age sons, Lyle, 21, and Eric, 18, who had been out for the evening...<br>
<br>
Court affidavits show that Snyder’s company, Video Cassette Recordings Inc., did business with and owed money to a firm allegedly controlled by a man linked by federal prosecutors to an East Coast crime family. .. Another area of interest to investigators is Live Entertainment’s acquisition this year of Strawberries Records, Tapes &amp; CDs, a Milford, Mass.-based retail chain that was owned by Morris Levy, a New York City record executive. Levy, sentenced last year in New Jersey to 10 years in federal prison for conspiring to extort money from a Philadelphia-area record distributor, has had a long association with Vincent (The Chin) Gigante, reputed boss of the Genovese crime family, according to law enforcement officials and court records.<br>
<br>
According to FBI documents, the Genovese family had an interest in the Strawberries chain before Levy bought it.<br>
<br>
In 1986, Menendez joined Carolco Pictures Inc. of West Hollywood, which owns 49% of Live Entertainment. That same year, Carolco purchased International Video Entertainment Inc. of Canoga Park, then owned by <span style="color:#FF0040">Noel C. Bloom of Hidden Hills</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Bloom was identified in a U.S. attorney general’s report on pornography and organized crime as a “major Los Angeles-based distributor” and “associated with Michael Zaffarano,” whom the attorney general said was a captain in an East Coast Mafia family.</span><br>
<br>
In a dispute arising out of the sale of International Video Entertainment, Bloom sued Carolco in Los Angeles Superior Court and last September a court referee found in his favor.<br>
<br>
No one has accused Bloom of any wrongdoing in connection with the Menendez investigation. Bloom declined to comment on Tuesday.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>From Soft Core To “Just For Kids!”<br>
<br>
Businessman Noel C. Bloom founded several home video distribution companies during the course of the booming 1980s home video market.  Some of them are likely familiar to you – Artisan Home Entertainment (starting as U.S.A. Home Video in 1983, then International Video Entertainment in 1985, then LIVE Entertainment beginning in 1988), Family Home Entertainment (1980-2005), and Celebrity Home Entertainment. Celebrity had soft core adult films in its catalog, which was nothing compared to Bloom’s Caballero<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">It was this company through which a sub-label was created to distribute children’s films, both of the obscure and well-known kind. </span> You could say that Family Home Entertainment had the children’s market covered, but this was a market saturated with competition.  And besides, Celebrity was good for distributing obscure content, so there was a need for a children’s company to do the same.<br>
<br>
Celebrity’s Just for Kids label was established in 1985, and distributed children’s programs and films, many of obscure nature, some international movies (including the Gamera movies, and many European and Japanese cartoons), and some very well-known content at the time, including Bravestarr, GI Joe: The Movie, COPS, and Filmation’s Ghostbusters.  the animated series capitalized on the live action show from the 1970s, which has nothing to do with the 1980s films and cartoons that are more commonly known and embraced.<br>
<br>
The “Just For Kids” videos were book-ended with segments featured Noel Bloom Jr., the son of Noel Bloom.  Beginning about 1987 or 1988, Little Noel (and his braces) introduced the video and reminded kids about how to adjust the tracking on their VCR for the best picture quality, and to stick around for the end of the program, so you – yes you – could find out how to receive a free “Just For Kids” videocassette!..<br>
<br>
Enter Just For Kids!</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Another article from that blog: THE STORY OF CHILDREN’S VIDEO LIBRARY <a href="https://allisonveneziowrites.com/2020/05/26/childrens-video-library/" class="postlink">https://allisonveneziowrites.com/2020/0 ... o-library/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The growing home video market in the 1980s came from more than just the major studios.  Smaller companies jumped into this lucrative business, vying for the dollars of people looking to not only rent, but also purchase home videos for their families.  This included the children’s genre.<br>
<br>
Last week, we looked at the story of Media Home Entertainment, whose children’s sub-label, Hi-Tops Video, released educational and entertaining content from 1986 until 1992, when its parent company was nearing its end.  The vibrant logo and fun logo jingle made the company a popular choice for kids’ home media, but there was another company, itself a sub-label, that was a direct competitor for those dollars.  It also had an impressive library, and a logo that was memorable, perhaps not always for the same reasons Hi-Tops logo was, but it was certainly memorable.  That logo was Children’s Video Library, and it wanted to lure you in with its own wholesome entertainment.<br>
<br>
But first, we have to look at the parent company that unleashed the logo’s balloons on the home video market in the 1980s.<br>
<br>
The Cheesy “V”<br>
Children’s Video Library was a sub-label of Vestron Video, a company established in Stamford, Connecticut in 1981. Its founder, Austin Owen Furst Jr., was an executive at HBO hired to dismantle the assets of Time-Life Films.  Furst, obviously wanting in on the growing home video market, purchased the library himself, and opened his own entertainment company with said assets.  The name “Vestron” came at his daughter’s suggestion – combining the Roman Goddess Vesta with “Tron,” meaning instrument in Greek.<br>
<br>
So no, this video company’s name has nothing to do with the Disney movie...<br>
<br>
As tastes in home video and movies matured, Vestron’s committed production of twenty “B” to “low A” films was the beginning of their undoing.  The company’s financing fell through, and in 1990, Vestron declared Chapter 11.  In January 1991, Vestron was bought out of bankruptcy by Los Angeles-based LIVE Entertainment, another home video company, and titles continued under Vestron until 1992.<br>
<br>
These days, <span style="color:#FF0040">Vestron releases are under Lions Gate Entertainment</span>, which acquired Vestron’s library’s original successor, Artisan Entertainment (LIVE’s forerunner company) in 2003.<br>
<br>
In 2016, something interesting happened in a world of “everything always comes back.”  That applied to the Vestron name as well.  <span style="color:#FF0040">Lionsgate Home Entertainmen</span>t resurrected the name Vestron Video as a Blu-Ray and DVD reissue label for Vestron and Lionsgate horror movies.  The “Vestron Video Collector’s Series” is branded with an updated version of the first Vestron logo (1982-1986, though I have no idea why – the later logo is much nicer), and the first releases, Chopping Mall  and Blood Diner (which I saw with my friends Amie and Ron) were released in September 27, 1986.  Reissues were done so between 2016 and 2018 (complete list).</div></blockquote>

THE LOGO THAT WRITES ITS OWN NAME: THE STORY OF FAMILY HOME ENTERTAINMENT <a href="https://allisonveneziowrites.com/2020/06/17/family-home-entertainment/" class="postlink">https://allisonveneziowrites.com/2020/0 ... rtainment/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We’ve been talking about the booming home video industry of the 1980s, and the various companies vying for those oh-so-lucrative children’s home video market dollars.  The options were plentiful, but there were several leaders of the time.  We’ve covered Hi-Tops Video and Children’s Video Library and their cutesy, child-friendly production logos, as well as their histories as part of larger home video companies Media and Vestron, respectively.  Last week, we looked at Celebrity Home Entertainment’s “Just For Kids” videos, especially the spokeschild for that company, Noel Bloom Jr.<br>
<br>
All of these companies popped up about the same time in the early-to-mid 1980s, all of them had a large catalog of children’s entertainment, including well-known cartoons and live action children’s programming.  There was another company out there that was just like the rest – it started before them, and went far longer than the rest did, but also boasts an impressive catalog.<br>
<br>
Heck, it even has a connection to Just For Kids...<br>
<br>
Family Home Entertainment was established in 1980 by Noel C. Bloom, he of Celebrity Home Entertainment (and its own sub-label, Just For Kids).  In its earliest days, F.H.E. produced videos that were not geared at the kids and family market, but shifted its entire focus to that group in 1981.<br>
<br>
The label was notable for its own catalog of releases, which included all of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles videos from the original animated series, as well as the live action movie in 1990, It’s A Wonderful Life, Hoosiers, Drop Dead Fred, The Last Unicorn, Transformers: The Movie, the Barbie animated movies from the early 2000s, Thundercats, and a fairly extensive list of other movies, cartoons, and television specials (IMDb list).  Their output, like the other kiddie companies of the 80s, had licensed characters intermingled with classic cartoons. ..<br>
<br>
Family Home Entertainment was acquired by <span style="color:#FF0040">Lions Gate Entertainment in 2003</span>, when they folded Artisan into their company.  By 2005, Family Home Entertainment was also folded, and its catalog is now owned by Lions Gate.  Though at this point, probably much of their pre-Artisan catalog is likely out of print of distributed by other companies...<br>
