<blockquote class="uncited"><div>View, the market leader in smart glass, announced that View Smart Windows are being installed at St. John’s Terminal, the 12-story, 1.3-million-square-foot, cutting-edge commercial office under development by Oxford Properties Group. This landmark Manhattan asset encompasses two entire city blocks along the Hudson River and will be the center of <span style="color:#FFFF00">Google’s Hudson Square campus</span>.<br>
<br>
View Smart Windows use artificial intelligence to optimize natural light and views of the outdoors while minimizing heat and glare and provide a more comfortable and healthier environment for people. In addition, smart windows reduce energy consumption by reducing cooling requirements.<br>
<br>
Designed by the sustainable architecture firm COOKFOX and with more than 400 linear feet of floor-to-ceiling smart windows from View, St. John’s Terminal will offer occupants unobstructed, west-facing views of the Hudson River and the widest sunset in New York City.<br>
<br>
"Our vision is to transform this historic waterfront site in the busiest city in North America into a space that is regenerative for people’s health and restores their connection to nature," said Rick Cook, a founding partner of COOKFOX Architects. "Natural light and views of the outdoors are key to human wellness. View Smart Windows are integral to our design for one of the healthiest buildings in New York City."<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Smart glass offers significant health advantages by reducing the incidence of eyestrain and headaches by over 50%. In a recent study, employees working next to View Smart Windows improved their sleep by 37 minutes per night and cognitive function by 42 percent.</em> These findings are particularly important today as users are focused on health, wellness, and re-entering the workplace with confidence.<br>

Smart Glass?  Google?  The internet of things?  Uh huh.. Smart Glass can cause health problems too. It can filter any or all of light wavelengths.  <br>

Red light therapy is even approved to help heal wounds. <br>
<br>
In terms of your mental health, light therapy has been proven to treat a multitude of conditions including for insomnia, seasonal affective disorder, and depression, as well as other mood disorders.

I strongly suspect that these artificial environments that they will be creating will have negative impacts on human health. Especially mental health. I did research on that and posted on Twitter a few months ago but Jack's minions blocked my account. I'll have to dig it up again.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The tinted world of tomorrow is coming, and airports—mini-cities of steel, concrete and lots and lots of glass—are interested. In a test last fall, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport outfitted one of its gates with a new type of “smart glass” that can adjust for sunlight exposure. The obvious point is to keep travelers from getting overheated—but the exercise also brought a more lucrative benefit...<br>
<br>
The test was designed to see if the product, called View Dynamic Glass, might improve passenger satisfaction along a small stretch of terminal real estate—specifically, gate seating at A28 and a burger restaurant’s east-facing bar, one regularly torched by the Texas sun.<br>
<br>
It turns out that a cooler, darker bar encourages an extra round or two. Alcohol sales soared 80 percent in October, compared with the same period in 2016, the installation of electrochromatic glass being the only difference. Alcohol contributed 17 percent of the restaurant’s total revenue in October 2017, compared with 9 percent the previous month and 8 percent in October 2016.<br>
<br>
The lesson was clear for the airport: Remove heat and glare from a glass-ensconced bar and people will dally longer, spending more.<br>
<br>
..The study at DFW, conducted by a Cornell University design professor, also found that surface temperatures on seats and carpeting near the new gate glass were 10F to 15F lower, boosting dwell time by 53 percent over that at a nearby gate with regular glass. Spending around the cooler gate rose as well... With their long warrens of glass walls, airports may seek to bolster revenues with this technology. View was, unsurprisingly, eager to help in the DFW experiment. “People have been studying green buildings for 50 years but there’s never been a comprehensive study on dynamic glass,” Bammi said.<br>
<br>
..The glass has been purchased by various companies and schools, such as Boston Logan Airport; Delta Air Lines Inc. (for a lounge at the Seattle airport); Duke University; FedEx Corp., Levi’s Stadium, LinkedIn Corp.; and Wells-Fargo &amp; Co.</div></blockquote></div>

THE PLAN FOR 9/11<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sarah Ferguson and Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald Howard Lutnick attend Annual Charity Day Hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald and BGC at BGC Partners, INC on September 11, 2014 in New York City. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/1ifa3a.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

After &amp; prior to 11 September 2001, prominent individuals with links to organised child sex trafficking &amp; paedophilia had knowledge of plans, consented to by powerful Friends of Israel, to allow terrorist attacks on key targets on 9/11. Among those with knowledge applicable to uncovering the truth: Ghislaine, Kevin &amp; Christine Maxwell, Howard Lutnick &amp; Sarah Ferguson...<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Children in Crisis</span><br>
<br>
     One of Sarah's original dubious children's charities. Founded by Ferguson &amp; friends in April 1993, some eight years before 9/11, Children in Crisis was a UK registered charity (see also Children in Crisis Trading Ltd &amp; Children in Crisis Italy). The renown of Children in Crisis &amp; its sister charity Chances for Children increased dramatically after 9/11. Why? Because Ferguson drew on her personal experience of 9/11 as a powerful PR tool as she toured newsrooms giving emotional interviews in the months following the atrocity...<br>
<br>
 NB: In 2018 Ferguson subsumed Children in Crisis into a different charity called Street Child created in 2008 (see below). Today Children in Crisis no longer exists as a standalone charity - only as a name within Sarah's burgeoning Street Child empire.<br>
<br>
 CEO (until 2010): Mark McKeown. Chair &amp; Trustee: Stowe School headmaster Dr Anthony Wallersteiner, son of the late Robert Maxwell's business partner...  Non-executive directors: Lee Amaitis of Cantor Fitzgerald/BGC Partners. Amaitis has been the head of CF's London office &amp; was the company's second in command to Howard Lutnick. (NB: major support for Children in Crisis has also come from Lutnick, who paid for Ferguson's office in the World Trade Center - see below). James Henderson, the ex CEO of Bell Pottinger. ..Bell Pottinger has represented serial paedophile Rolf Harris, Kate &amp; Gerry McCann, and the Mark Warner Co. in whose holiday villas the McCanns had been staying. A week prior to Madeleine McCann's disappearance, Bell Pottinger "had its crisis management subsidiary Resonate in situ at the Ocean Club". <br>
<br>
..Founded by Ferguson in 1994 as a US offshoot of Children in Crisis &amp; now seemingly defunct, Chances for Children Inc had US headquarters on the 101st floor of WTC One in office space supplied to Ferguson free by her close friends, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick &amp; Howard's wife, Allison Lutnick nee Lambert, a lawyer. (The Lutnicks also supplied Ferguson with free office space in Milan: possibly for Children in Crisis Italy). The duchess has ever since returned the favour by supporting the Lutnicks' own charities. Howard Lutnick had a brother, Gary Lutnick, who was employed in Cantor Fitzgerald's WTC offices &amp; died when the planes hit. <br>
<br>
Chances for Children CEO (dates unknown): Ann Desollar, who claims that her then-boyfriend was the ill-fated Cantor Fitzgerald partner Gary Lutnick. Chances for Children Co-Founder &amp; Exec. Director (Dec 1994-Jul 1996) and Co-President &amp; Board Member (Sep 1997-Sep 2002): Christine 'Tine' Ward (nee Gallagher). 'Tine' Ward started out as Ferguson's PA before co-founding Chances for Children.with the duchess &amp; serving as its Exec. Director. Ward married British stockbroker Greville Ward in Bath in 1995; however it's unknown if they remain married. Tine Ward went on to found The Darfur Project &amp; in this capacity was a member of/participant in The Clinton Global Initiative in 2007 alongside Mossad child-procurer Ghislaine. Other 2007 Clinton Global Initiative participants: Jeffrey Epstein's brother (Mark); Edgar, Sara &amp; Clare Bronfman (Clare in 2019 pled guilty in the Nxivm sex cult case); Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, her husband Sir Evelyn, and Evelyn's son David de Rothschild (who has also been a supporter of Ghislaine's dubious &amp; now-defunct TerraMar charity). It's unclear whether 'CEO' Ann Desollar or 'Exec. Director' Tine Ward held the superior position in the charity or if perhaps they alternated in the top job in different periods.<br>
<br>
After taking part in the 2007 Clinton Global Initiative, Ward founded Rockflower, a 'nonprofit venture philanthropy fund' where she now works for herself, living in Rhode Island. Chances for Children's non-executive directors (all based in the Greater NYC area): Sarah Ferguson; James Gerard, an asset management specialist; Dr Irwin Redlener, a Jewish paediatrician who has reportedly advised the US Dept Homeland Security, and "who once had lunch with Fidel Castro &amp; has seen Michael Jackson cry"; Joseph Michaels IV, a Jewish tax lawyer; &amp; 'Tine' Ward nee Gallagher (who also served as the Exec. Director).<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund.</span><br>
<br>
..The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund raises money for organisations including Ferguson's Street Child and Children in Crisis, as well as Centrepoint. Centrepoint was founded by an associate of the Kray twins who knew about the Westminster-VIP paedophile network. (We presume that The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund is the same fund to which Ferguson referred – see above – &amp; into which The Duchess of York's 9/11 Fund transferred its 'earnings'). According to former Crain's editor Jeremy Smerd, $10m pledged by Cantor Fitzgerald to a 9/11 fund was not paid.<br>
<br>
Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund President/CEO/Exec. Director: Edie Lutnick, sibling of Howard Lutnick &amp; the late Gary Lutnick. Celebrity Ambassadors: Frank Bruno, who, as well as being friends with Ferguson, was <span style="color:#FF0040">a close friend of the late Jimmy Savile</span>. Other celebrities who've been associated with the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund: the Duke &amp; Duchess of Sussex (Edie Lutnick &amp; Meghan Markle have been photographed together).<br>
<br>
..The Operation Death Eaters organisation has posed the following question: "[Ferguson] was heavily involved in charities such as Children In Crisis and Street Child, targeting children from eastern Europe. Her friends [Epstein] and [Ghislaine], who purchased children from Balkans child trafficker [Jean-Luc Brunel], paid her [Ferguson] for what?"<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FFFF00">CANTOR FITZGERALD (CF)</span>, the World Trade Center-based trading firm that lost 658 of its employees to the 9/11 attacks (not including Ferguson or Howard Lutnick!), <span style="color:#FFFF00">had foreknowledge of the attacks, according to Max Keiser.</span><br>
<br>
Keiser accuses CF traders of trying to make a corrupt profit based on this macabre form of insider trading rather than saving their own lives &amp; those of the other victims. One hedge-fund told the NY Times that he'd heard that<span style="color:#FFFF00"> major short-selling</span> had been happening in eSpeed, the electronic bond-trading network controlled by CF.....<span style="color:#FFFF00">It's been further reported that CF had a long-standing relationship with the Office of Naval Intelligence, "the one &amp; only intelligence group" that had offices remaining in the section of the Pentagon struck by an attacking flight.</span><br>
<br>
Moreover, a year earlier (&amp; in 1997 as well), a group of CF executives &amp; traders had been the primary 'financial/private sector' participants in economic war games set up, &amp; participated in, by various US Intel agencies &amp; the Council on Foreign Relations, of which Ghislaine's associate Jeffrey Epstein was a member...On Sep 11, 2001 Howard Lutnick was taking his child to a first day of kindergarten, &amp; six more executives were scheduled for a fishing trip that day. That trip was reportedly cancelled due to inclement weather at 8 am, but every photo of the World Trade Center that day shows clear skies.<br>
<br>
ABC News reported: "Two days after hijacked jets were slammed into the WTC, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO HOWARD LUTNICK was sobbing on national TV, pledging that his bond-trading firm would look after the families of the company's more than 700 victims. The following day, he cut off the paychecks of those who were missing ... He then said he would sever the victims' health benefits by the end of September ...<br>
<br>
<br>
...Weirdly, CANTOR FITZGERALD (CF) sponsored summer charity galas at Stowe School in England in 2002, 2003 &amp; 2004. GHISLAINE attended the 2003 summer gala. It was called the La Dolce Vita party &amp; was to fund-raise for the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund. Stowe School is in Stowe, Bucks., in a constituency previously represented in Parliament by Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine's late father!<br>
