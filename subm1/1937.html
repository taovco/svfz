<blockquote class="uncited"><div>.. The way I see it, American politics from 1954-74 is a continuum defined by the struggle between the Richard Nixon apparat and the Kennedy machine, with the Howard Hughes empire serving as a fulcrum in what amounted to a secret war for the country’s soul. CIA spooks, mobsters on three coasts and a coven of Texas oligarchs built the <span style="color:#00FF40">“magic box”. *</span><br>
<br>
John Meier’s story is a fungible one in the sense that it could serve as the basis for a rock-’em-sock-’em tv series, motion picture or documentary about the Deep State. By that, I mean the cryptocracy that has evolved since the Cold War along a political continuum defined by assassination, surveillance and cover-up.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF00">The Howard Hughes organization, with its ties to Texas oil, Las Vegas gambling, Hollywood and the CIA was the secret fulcrum of that continuum</span>, mediating a political struggle that, by turns, saw the Kennedy’s devastated by murder and the Nixon camp destroyed by what looks, increasingly, like a soft coup d’etat. In this, John Meier was a Zelig-like figure, at once a witness and a participant, so well-connected – and so deeply involved – that it could only have ended in exile or a grave.<br>
<br>
The focal point of that tale, from which everything else proceeds, is obviously the secret war for the Hughes empire.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics"><span style="color:#00FF40">Edit Note:* In international political terms, a MAGIC BOX is a “cover” organization used by a nation’s spy apparatus.</span> A MAGIC BOX allows its inhabitants to hide anything they possess or do, regardless of the importance of what is being done or hidden. The Hughes Organization supplied the CIA with a very special MAGIC BOX. It is from within this MAGIC BOX that the CIA and its corporate and political friends operate. When John Meier opted out of the MAGIC BOX, he became an impediment to its continued existence.</em></div></blockquote>

Paul Laxalt was an American attorney and politician who was governor of Nevada from 1967 to 1971 and a United States senator from 1974 to 1987. When Hughes moved to Nevada it was Lexalt who helped him attain a license for his first casino.<br>

The CIA's torture taxi <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/library/2013/02/26/Mohamed_appx_taxi.pdf" class="postlink">http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/l ... x_taxi.pdf</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>THIS IS A story about an airplane, a Boeing 737 passenger jet<br>
<br>
This is also a story about torture, the war on terrorism, and the Central Intelligence Agency's practice of quietly snatching suspected<br>
terrorists and transporting them to dungeons in far-off lands, ....<br>
....<br>
FAA records show plane number N313P was initially purchased by a Massachusetts company called Premier Executive Transport<br>
Services Inc., a tiny firm that owned one other plane.......<br>
<br>
.. plane N313P had blanket permission to land at any US Army base anywhere in the world, ..<br>
<br>
He became convinced it was being used for "extraordinary rendition," the process of dragging purported terrorists to countries where<br>
regard for human rights is low and the use of torture in eliciting testimony is common..<br>
At this point, there's little doubt the plane served as Langley's torture taxi. The Washington Post, 60 Minutes, and numerous German<br>
media outlets have all tied Boeing number N313P to the agency, and all traces of its putative owner, Premier, have vanished. The<br>
company's boss appears to be a completely fictional character.<br>
<br>
It was the Boeing's alleged role in the kidnapping of a German citizen, a 42-year-old man of Lebanese descent named Khaled El-Masri,<br>
that put Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the defensive during her recent visit to Germany...<br>
According to the suit, El-Masri was forcibly abducted on New Year's Eve 2003, while on vacation in Macedondia..<br>
<br>
The story doesn't stop with Premier. When journalists started connecting the dots in 2004, Premier sold the Boeing to a Reno firm called<br>
Keeler and Tate Management Group LLC. The transaction is recorded in FAA documents we obtained.<br>
Though Keeler and Tate is named in the ACLU's suit – along with Premier, another aviation outfit, and former CIA chief George Tenet –<br>
nobody's really checked out the company yet, so we decided to take a little trip up I-80 to northern Nevada to see what we could uncover.<br>
Things got shady fast ...The only live person we could find on the Keeler and Tate paperwork was Steven F. Petersen, an attorney who acts as its "registered<br>
agent",<br>
Petersen and <span style="color:#FFFF00">Peter Laxalt</span> have a clear business relationship. ..The building directory says the suite is also home to the Reno branch of the Paul Laxalt Group, a major Capitol Hill lobbying firm.<br>
<br>
A little background is in order: Peter and Paul Laxalt are brothers. A hawkish Republican, Paul Laxalt .. was also, according to the New<br>
York Times, a good friend of late CIA director William Casey. After leaving Congress, Paul Laxalt pulled a classic politico move, promptly forming a lobby shop, dubbing it the Paul Laxalt Group, and hiring his brother Peter.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Kathleen Foley is involved in the "palliative" medicine movement. <span style="color:#FFFF00">She worked with George Soros, Purdue Pharma, and J&amp;J</span> to manufacture the opiate crisis. Palliative Care trades the conventional concept of curative medicine with one that focuses on pain relief (opiates)<br>
<br>
She began working with George Soros in 1995 when <span style="color:#FF0040">he founded the "Project on Death in America" in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</span><br>
<br>
This project began sponsoring doctors, nurses, teachers, universities, and textbooks to lower the threshold in which doctors would prescribe opiates. They created a "painscale" for patients and doctors, and integrated pain as a "vital sign". It started with terminal cancer patients and slowly opiates became the preferred first line strategy for all pain mgmt. They even funded propaganda stating opiates were "perfectly safe" and acetominophin and ibuprofen were dangerous due to liver damage<br>
<br>
The Sackler family got the raw material for their opiates from J&amp;J's farms. They too sponsored Kathleen Foley. Mortimer Sackler and George Soros were tennis buddies and neighbors in Gstaad.
