			<div class="content">I have this hunch that the vaccine has the purpose of sterilizing people. It wouldn't be the first time in which vaccines are used to sterilize people. Why would they push this vaccine so much, when ~99% of the population does not need it? The virus is real, vaccines do work, but this is suspicious as fuck.<br>
<br>
The whole neo-malthusian agenda to depopulate the world because of muh environment and all that crap is alive and well in the minds of the elites. I think they're going to use the vaccine to sterilize a small percentage of people.<br>
<br>
And I don't think the jews are behind this one, though. They get the vaccine too. What people don't seem to get is that not all of the jews are in on the conspiracy; most of them are bad people who hate whites and actively push for ethnic replacement and even pedophilia, that's for sure. But they're not in cahoots with Rothschild or Kissinger; they're getting as screwed as we are. Israel already has abortion and is the gayest place on Earth. If they had everything under control, they wouldn't have spent almost a century fighting against shitty arabs who toss stones at tanks. Do you really think the jews could extort, manipulate or control people like the royal families of Spain, Britain and Netherlands, the Saudi, the Bushes, Gates, Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie, the Vatican and others, while they openly plot for their destruction? One single word would be enough to expose them. Trump would have to come out and simple say "jews" before an audience, and people would wake up instantly. It would only take one "whistleblower" to expose people to the truth. Only one. Imagine if the queen of England came out and said "the jews are doing it". There would be massive riots all across the globe and the whole jewish plot would lose its effectiveness.<br>
<br>
But no, they aren't "handling" them. They are cooperating because at the top it isn't about judaism or nationalism. It's about a worldwide collectivist regime, with the "chosen few, the elect" at the top and the cattle at the bottom. There's more than one player.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I have this hunch that the vaccine has the purpose of sterilizing people.</div></blockquote>

There’s no way of knowing yet, as the development time was shorter than the human gestation period.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It wouldn't be the first time in which vaccines are used to sterilize people.</div></blockquote>

To that point...<br>
<br>
Two subsequent years of receiving the flu vaccine boosts miscarriage rates from a baseline of 14 % to 77%. The normal miscarriage rate, after a woman comes up hot on a fertility test, is 14%. Obviously, this does not count failures to conceive after fertilization, because in those cases a woman never shows up as pregnant on any test. The abstract proves that every time you get the flu shot after the first shot, it is only a booster shot to make the anti-fertility component work even better. This study only shows what happens after two subsequent years of getting the shot. The numbers are not obvious to the layman, but by cross checking different data sources to make sure I understood what they were saying, I was able to extract the real miscarriage rate from a sea of planned parenthood inspired BS, and then put the numbers this abstract states into terms anyone can understand,<br>
<br>

<br>
Normal miscarriage rates are 14% after pregnancy is confirmed (when you are not calling induced abortions miscarriages). After ONE flu shot, a woman’s chance of miscarriage increases to 37%. If, the next year, she gets another flu shot, her chances of miscarriage increase to 77%. The study did not go to the third year of getting the flu shot. The abstract is so damning that the numbers look impossible! If you use planned parenthood’s numbers–which are greatly overstated–and plug them into the numbers in this abstract, the miscarriage rate would have to be over 200% (which we all know is not possible).<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Abstract introductions inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended in any stage of pregnancy. but evidence of safety in early pregnancy is limited, including for vaccines containing A/H1N1pdm2009 (pH1N1) antigen. We sought to determine if receipt of vaccine containing pH1N1 was associated with <strong class="text-strong">spontaneous abortion</strong> (SAB).</div></blockquote>

My comment: the bolded text means that this was a study to see if the flu vaccine really was an anti fertility vaccine. hence the phrase “spontaneous abortion.” This proves they had a reason to be suspicious, because they only did this study to see if the flu vaccine was an anti fertility vaccine, which causes spontaneous abortions.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We conducted a case control study over two influenza seasons (2010-11, 2011-12) in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Cases had spontaneous abortion and controls had live births or stillbirths and were matched on site, date of last menstrual period, and age. Of 919 potential cases identified using diagnosis codes, 485 were eligible and confirmed by medical record review. Exposure was defined as vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine before the SAB date: the primary exposure window was the 1-28 days before the SAB. The overall adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.1-3.6) for vaccine receipt in the 28-day exposure window; there was no association in other exposure windows. In season-specific analyses, the aOR in the 1-28 days was 3.7 (95% CI 1.4-9.4) in 2010-11 and 1.4 (95% CI 0.6-3.3) in 2011-12. The association was modified by influenza vaccination in the prior season (post hoc analysis). Among women who received pH1N1-containing vaccine in the previous influenza season, the aOR in the 1-28 days was 7.7 (95% CI 2.2-27.3); the aOR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.7-2.7) among women not vaccinated in the previous season. This effect modification was observed in each season.</div></blockquote>

My comment: The above states the ratios between unvaccinated and vaccinated women, also showing the maximum possible error swings. The error swings are reported in a way that is way out of whack to leave near-mentally deranged margins of error. In this case, the margin allowed was 2.0, when the normal rate of miscarriage was 1.4, which represents a margin of error that allows a result more than double normal miscarriage rates to simply be called “error” to help conceal the severity of the damage from the vaccines. But even this fails, because the damage was too much to bury even with that huge error swing allowed. The first numbers outside of quotes - 3.7 followed by 1.4, shows 3.7 as the rate of miscarriage after vaccination in the first year (before their "error margins" were applied, and 1.4 as the baseline miscarriage rate in unvaccinated women for the same year. For the second subsequent year of women getting the flu shot, the rate of miscarriage in vaccinated women was 7.7, and the rate of miscarriage in unvaccinated women was 1.3<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Conclusion: Spontaneous abortion was associated with influenza vaccination in the preceding 28 days. The association was significant only among women vaccinated in the previous influenza season with pH1N1-containing vaccine. This study does not and cannot establish a causal relationship between repeated influenza vaccination and spontaneous abortion, but further research is warranted</div></blockquote>

My comment: It is clear they tried to lie here by leaving margin of errors so high that they buried the first year stats, but in the second year the damage was so much they could not hide it, no matter how they fudged the data. After showing an increase in miscarriage from 14 percent to 77 percent, they then say it is no big deal and can be ignored until further research proves the vaccine is actually a veiled anti fertility vaccine. But the numbers more than obviously speak for themselves.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why would they push this vaccine so much</div></blockquote>

Control. It’s literally that simple.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>And I don't think the jews are behind this one, though. They get the vaccine too.</div></blockquote>

They’re refusing it.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What people don't seem to get is that not all of the jews are in on the conspiracy</div></blockquote>

They are. To BE a jew is to be complicit.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Do you really think the jews could extort, manipulate or control people like the royal families of Spain, Britain and Netherlands, the Saudi, the Bushes, Gates, Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie, the Vatican and others, while they openly plot for their destruction?</div></blockquote>

Yes. Since they did.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>One single word would be enough to expose them.</div></blockquote>

No one. Anywhere. Does a single fucking thing. No one. WORDS. DON’T. MATTER. They PUBLICLY STATE EVERYTHING THEY’RE DOING and no one does anything about it. What are you talking about.<br>

Who sold his entire family to jews and is a jewish puppet.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>would have to come out and simple say "jews" before an audience, and people would wake up instantly.</div></blockquote>

No. They wouldn’t. That’s literally not how this works at all. TRUTH IS MEANINGLESS. THE FACTS TELL NOTHING TO THEM. <a href="https://archive.org/details/YuriBezmenovDeceptionWasMyJob" class="postlink">https://archive.org/details/YuriBezmeno ... onWasMyJob</a><br>

It is, though.<br>

Jews and their shabbos goyim.</div>

			<div class="content">A "conspiracy" I believe but cannot prove is that jews do not have souls, but feed off the energy created by ours. Also that they commune with entities like Baphoment, who instruct them on what to do. Like this holocough hoax. It's absolutely brilliant in every way and I don't believe they conceived it themselves. You really think these demons need more money? They have more than they can spend, it's not about that - they are building an afterlife for themselves, or they think they are anyway.<br>

About the jewvaxx, I think the main agenda is the nanotech in the vaxx. They need to get that into everyone asap to change their genetic material; it will affect neural pathways and make the sheep even more susceptible to the programming than they already are.

-Depeche Mode, "Stripped"<br>
<br>
Normies won't believe anything unless they see it on TV. Most people don't believe out of facts, reason and evidence. It's all a matter of feelings. For people to wake up to conspiracies, they must have an open mind and allow <em class="text-italics">themselves </em>to consider the possibility of one. It's very easy to twist the words of a few "internet wackos" (people like you and I) and listen to the "experts". If it were on TV, the sheeple would start to react and ask questions. Sometimes it takes a personal experience to open their minds to the possibilities. Nothing convinces you more than finding out for yourself that there is a conspiracy (like it happened to me).<br>
<br>
The idea of the chosen few vs. the masses isn't only jewish. It's the basis of all esoteric traditions; the initiated and the uninitiated. Brothers vs. the Profane. Those who know (gnostikoi) and the rest. The priestcraft and the herd, etc. etc. etc. And these societies predate judaism; Ancient Egypt already had them. The teachings are pretty much the same (see pythagoreanism, alumbrados, freemasonry, gnosticism, kabbalah, mystery schools).<br>
<br>
Your argument is circular; jews can do it because they did. You start assuming these people are all under immutable jewish control; that is practically impossible to carry out. Not even the worst totalitarianisms managed to have such control over their populace; Catholicism had heretics, Kings had usurpers, communism had defectors and refugees... and you're telling me these people can have absolute control over the powerful people of the world, without anyone rebelling against them even though they are plotting to destroy them? You're telling me powerful men with a legacy of success would simply bow to jews, without any personal ambition? Give me a break. Jews couldn't pull of 9/11 without the dancing israelis getting caught (shortly released afterwards), they can't get rid of the Palestinians after decades of war and can't stop the memes.<br>
<br>
You're giving them too much credit; that works to their advantage. It's wise to make your enemy believe you're stronger than you really are.</div>

A "conspiracy" I believe but cannot prove is that jews do not have souls, but feed off the energy created by ours. Also that they commune with entities like Baphoment, who instruct them on what to do. Like this holocough hoax. It's absolutely brilliant in every way and I don't believe they conceived it themselves. You really think these demons need more money? They have more than they can spend, it's not about that - they are building an afterlife for themselves, or they think they are anyway.<br>
<br>
About the jewvaxx, I think the main agenda is the nanotech in the vaxx. They need to get that into everyone asap to change their genetic material; it will affect neural pathways and make the sheep even more susceptible to the programming than they already are.

</div></blockquote>

I studied the esoteric and I can tell you Baphomet (also known as the "goat of mendes") is not what you think. It's not even supposed to be a demon. Baphomet represents the "divine androgyne", the hermaphrodite, "6+5", the twin towers being destroyed and replaced by the single "One world trade center", the two pillars of Samson, Hercules and the temple of Solomon, the union of the opposites. This concept can be found in many schools of thought; kundalini yoga, the Greek caduceus, alchemical marriage, the Great work, yin and yang and even judaism; God has a female aspect (Shekhinah); the jewish star consists of two triangles intersected. The knights templar, who were secretly gnostics, apparently "worshipped" a tri-headed god called Baphomet; possibly alluding the concept of the trinity and the union of the two opposites into a neutral one. It's all allegorical symbols for principles, forces and ideas, rather than actual beings.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, it is absolutely true that these doctrines do teach what we'd call "magic". Rituals to contact spirits who will do your bidding. In fact, King Solomon was said to command demons to build his temple (which is in turn, an allegory for the human body, which is the temple of the "divine spark" or soul). Kabbalah has a branch called "practical kabbalah" which is simply magic. I don't believe in any of that, but I do think the elites, jew or non jew, who like you said have enough money not to work a single day of their lives, seek new thrills and sources of entertainment in the world of the occult; it's a taboo, it's non-materialistic, it's "dangerous" and can allegedly give them more and more power.</div>

<br>
Also: Don't be afraid. They're not demons. And if this is the plan demons came up with, they're doing a piss poor job at it. The WHO and the "experts" are largely discredited because of their mishandling of the "crisis" and their contradictions, there are protests everywhere, not all people wear the mask, people are getting tired (even in Argentina, and that's a lot to say)... Don't give them that much credit. Jews or not, the people who did this don't have everything under control. This is an attempt to extend their control.<br>
<br>
If there are demons... Where are all the angels?</div>

I have this hunch that the vaccine has the purpose of sterilizing people. It wouldn't be the first time in which vaccines are used to sterilize people. Why would they push this vaccine so much, when ~99% of the population does not need it? The virus is real, vaccines do work, but this is suspicious as fuck.<br>
<br>
The whole neo-malthusian agenda to depopulate the world because of muh environment and all that crap is alive and well in the minds of the elites. I think they're going to use the vaccine to sterilize a small percentage of people.<br>
<br>
And I don't think the jews are behind this one, though. They get the vaccine too. What people don't seem to get is that not all of the jews are in on the conspiracy; most of them are bad people who hate whites and actively push for ethnic replacement and even pedophilia, that's for sure. But they're not in cahoots with Rothschild or Kissinger; they're getting as screwed as we are. Israel already has abortion and is the gayest place on Earth. If they had everything under control, they wouldn't have spent almost a century fighting against shitty arabs who toss stones at tanks. Do you really think the jews could extort, manipulate or control people like the royal families of Spain, Britain and Netherlands, the Saudi, the Bushes, Gates, Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie, the Vatican and others, while they openly plot for their destruction? One single word would be enough to expose them. Trump would have to come out and simple say "jews" before an audience, and people would wake up instantly. It would only take one "whistleblower" to expose people to the truth. Only one. Imagine if the queen of England came out and said "the jews are doing it". There would be massive riots all across the globe and the whole jewish plot would lose its effectiveness.<br>
<br>
But no, they aren't "handling" them. They are cooperating because at the top it isn't about judaism or nationalism. It's about a worldwide collectivist regime, with the "chosen few, the elect" at the top and the cattle at the bottom. There's more than one player.
</div></blockquote>

oy vey its the Iranian jesuits!!
</div></blockquote>

<br>
no its just the jews only the jews the rest are shabbos goy who do what the jews tell them its always the jews it cant be any other because its not edgy enough only jews.<br>
<br>
Even if all jews disappeared, you'd still have problems. The problem with you people is that you are no different from the normies. You found an edgy meme on 4chan and that's it, that's the end of your research. Because it isn't about the truth; it's about your emotions.</div>

No. I arrived at my opinion about jews after 30 years of carefully looking into everything that is wrong. It is the jews. They own and control almost everything. They did it by way of The Federal Reserve. They had plenty of help, though, from zio Christians so9 that they can be one of the 2800 slaves that jews take to hell.
</div></blockquote>

<br>
I know of all those things. Why would christians help those who are actively harming and enslaving them? I do not deny the jews are involved; there is a zionist plot to take over the world. They conspire against their allies, but they can't subsist without their permission.<br>
<br>
But most jews won't get slaves. Most jews have to suffer the degeneracies of the world like the rest of us. If they can't get rid of the muslims at the door, why can they rule the entire world, uncontested, for at least a century? In fact, the US didn't support Israel until a few years later when they had won a few military conflicts in the Middle East. There has never been such a regime in history before; not even in the times of pharaohs, communists, the church and emperors in which a leader had no opposition whatsoever. There is no way they can execute a perfect plan, with perfect compliance from their own enemies, no whistleblowers and no one in the world to compete against them. Do you really think jews can execute such a plan, let alone for more than a century? What about Hungary, Japan, China, Bulgaria, Poland, India and other countries that don't allow stupid globalist migration?<br>
<br>
You'll find plenty of jews in the upper echelons of conspiracies, that's for sure. But they aren't the only ones, and they didn't get there alone. All the globalist institutions were created by wealthy non-jews.</div>

			<div class="content">No,the virus isn't real. Death rates are consistent with yearly deaths from cold,flus,and other normal viruses. Note the number of flu cases this year were incredibly low. Guess why. All they have to do is lie about what they had and bam,it's another "covid death". Doctor don't even have to be in on it. The PCR tests give random positives and negatives so unless they test the same subject multiple times,they probably aren't going to notice it. So we have a test that gives random results,deaths from other things attributed to coivd,and a death rate that's a 5 year low.<br>
<br>
It's fake. Just like SARS and the various animal flus.<br>
<br>
Secondly,what makes you think the jews and their puppets are taking the same shit they want to give us? All they need is a doctor or even a nurse on the take and a syringe full of salt water and they "took the vaccine". This is bullshitting 101,mother fucker. Are you sure you're a skeptic? They got out of fighting in WW2,a war they started,with MEDICAL EXPEMPTIONS FROM JEWISH DOCTORS!!! The fuck makes you think they wouldn't do it again? And yes,that means all the "fightin' jews" in the (((Hollywood))) movies are completely fictional. You need to understand how easy it is to lie to people.<br>
<br>
And yes,they do. They manipulate everyone. If they aren't leading a country directly (Saudi royal family are ethnic jews) they run shit behind the scenes with puppets. Note pretty much everyone in DC had ties to Epstein. Do you honestly think he wasn't blackmailing them? And that Israel doesn't have all his blackmail material to continue to blackmail them even now? Damn,you're fucking naive.<br>
<br>
But lets say Trump did go in front of a crowd and say "it's the jews". Let's say he went on a long winded speech explaining how it's the jews,always has be the jews,why it's the jews,and makes the most solid case ever. Do you really think people are going to throw out their brainwashing that easily? The media will be "literally Hitlering" his ass into the ground and they'd use that speech to show it to the world. Every jew would go into maximum jew and declare him the enemy of humanity. Humanity,defined by judaism,as being the jews and only the jews.<br>
<br>
He'd be dead in an hour and everyone would cheer. Don't lie to yourself. My brother is a conspiracy nut and he won't believe it's the jews. He can't connect that the Illuminati,the pseudo-religious international cabal with their fingers in everything,could possibly be the jews,a pseudo-religious international cabal with their fingers in everything.<br>
<br>
So to sum up,it's the fucking jews.</div>

Kind of sounds like OCD. If there were such a force... Why didn't it make you a nigger?<br>

Mental health is often neglected. It's either that or tumblr faggots romanticizing it. It's always cool to be the dark, edgy person with schizophrenia with a fallen angel complex.</div>

It's funny how you overestimate the jews and underestimate the doctors; millions of people apparently working on something they didn't see. See, this is the problem with the "it's just the jews" crowd. They think the non-jewish elites were doing nothing for centuries and would gladly submit to jews (which they openly hated) without offering any resistance. Jews cannot pull it off by themselves. They need allies, race traitors. Why didn't the elites of the world try to fight them? They could have pulled it off. If anything, jews took over because white people fight each other and they exploit it. And before you tell me that they were always jew all along; Why didn't they pull globalism back then, when they were literally kings? What the hell took them so long?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Secondly,what makes you think the jews and their puppets are taking the same shit they want to give us? All they need is a doctor or even a nurse on the take and a syringe full of salt water and they "took the vaccine". This is bullshitting 101,mother fucker. </div></blockquote>

Sure, forget about it. It's saline solution or distilled water. Lol at the last sentence. I could hear it in my head.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Are you sure you're a skeptic?</div></blockquote>

Don't think you're so clever; I've heard this line many times before from normies. Yes, I am a skeptic. I question past beyond the edgy memes, which is more than what most so-called redpilled people do. Just like when normies get angry when you suggest anything bad about the jews, so-called redpilled lose their shit when someone suggests it isn't only the jews.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>They got out of fighting in WW2,a war they started,with MEDICAL EXPEMPTIONS FROM JEWISH DOCTORS!!! The fuck makes you think they wouldn't do it again? And yes,that means all the "fightin' jews" in the (((Hollywood))) movies are completely fictional. You need to understand how easy it is to lie to people. </div></blockquote>

WW2, like WW1, wasn't only about the jews. In both scenarios, the entire "civilized" world fought against Germany, which was a growing superpower that would surpass the UK and the US. Do you really think that the only reason behind both WW1 and WW2 was only that the jews were offended and had their power threatened? No other geopolitical reasons for war? And I'm not talking about "Hitler wanted to take over the world" trope.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> And yes,they do. They manipulate everyone. If they aren't leading a country directly (Saudi royal family are ethnic jews) they run shit behind the scenes with puppets. Note pretty much everyone in DC had ties to Epstein. Do you honestly think he wasn't blackmailing them? And that Israel doesn't have all his blackmail material to continue to blackmail them even now? Damn,you're fucking naive. </div></blockquote>

I never said the jews weren't doing anything. It is true. My point is that at the top, it isn't just jews. The conspiracy for world totalitarianism is not inherently jewish. Whether jews hijacked the movement is an entirely different thing.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>But lets say Trump did go in front of a crowd and say "it's the jews". Let's say he went on a long winded speech explaining how it's the jews,always has be the jews,why it's the jews,and makes the most solid case ever. Do you really think people are going to throw out their brainwashing that easily? The media will be "literally Hitlering" his ass into the ground and they'd use that speech to show it to the world. Every jew would go into maximum jew and declare him the enemy of humanity. Humanity,defined by judaism,as being the jews and only the jews.</div></blockquote>

At least a few people would wake up. A few, but some would. Most wouldn't, but people all throughout the world would agree; especially in other countries around the globe. Maybe not the majority, but certainly enough people to trigger a reaction against jewish domination. It would put jewish conspiracies back on the mainstream (if they aren't already). If they're already triggered by QAnon, which Trump never openly endorsed, imagine if he gave a speech calling them out. 4Chan would go insane, so would facebook, twitter and other social media. People would start waking up. Protests, getting guns, organizing, etc. It would bring about change. Forget about wars for Israel.</div></blockquote></div>

A "conspiracy" I believe but cannot prove is that jews do not have souls, but feed off the energy created by ours. Also that they commune with entities like Baphoment, who instruct them on what to do. Like this holocough hoax. It's absolutely brilliant in every way and I don't believe they conceived it themselves. You really think these demons need more money? They have more than they can spend, it's not about that - they are building an afterlife for themselves, or they think they are anyway.<br>
<br>
About the jewvaxx, I think the main agenda is the nanotech in the vaxx. They need to get that into everyone asap to change their genetic material; it will affect neural pathways and make the sheep even more susceptible to the programming than they already are. You'll get your "software" update via your annual vaxx and you will be an obedient drone: a docile organ donor sitting in your pod living a virtual life and you will love it.
</div></blockquote>

I studied the esoteric and I can tell you Baphomet (also known as the "goat of mendes") is not what you think. It's not even supposed to be a demon. Baphomet represents the "divine androgyne", the hermaphrodite, "6+5", the twin towers being destroyed and replaced by the single "One world trade center", the two pillars of Samson, Hercules and the temple of Solomon, the union of the opposites. This concept can be found in many schools of thought; kundalini yoga, the Greek caduceus, alchemical marriage, the Great work, yin and yang and even judaism; God has a female aspect (Shekhinah); the jewish star consists of two triangles intersected. The knights templar, who were secretly gnostics, apparently "worshipped" a tri-headed god called Baphomet; possibly alluding the concept of the trinity and the union of the two opposites into a neutral one. It's all allegorical symbols for principles, forces and ideas, rather than actual beings.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, it is absolutely true that these doctrines do teach what we'd call "magic". Rituals to contact spirits who will do your bidding. In fact, King Solomon was said to command demons to build his temple (which is in turn, an allegory for the human body, which is the temple of the "divine spark" or soul). Kabbalah has a branch called "practical kabbalah" which is simply magic. I don't believe in any of that, but I do think the elites, jew or non jew, who like you said have enough money not to work a single day of their lives, seek new thrills and sources of entertainment in the world of the occult; it's a taboo, it's non-materialistic, it's "dangerous" and can allegedly give them more and more power.
</div></blockquote>
 I've also studied Baphomet through the books of Tracy Twyman. She was the best researcher, that's why she was suicided in 2019.</div>

She did, many of her excellent interviews and her website mysteriously disappeared off the web after she was killed. It's worth digging up some of the old interviews Freeman Fly did with her (freemantv.com), you should also still be able to find old interviews Greg Carlwood did with her on The Higherside Chats. Not much else remains (online) of her legacy. She was light years ahead of everyone. I only own 3 books of hers, the price quadrupled after her unexpected death in 2019. She and her 5 year old were harassed, threatened and gang stalked (all her stuff hacked) after she went to the FBI to report paedo-related videos posted by pupils of a UK school on YT.  I've got Baphomet: The temple mystery unveiled, Clockshavings, and Money Grows on the Tree of Knowledge. But I think the book that would interest you most is Genuflect, her last book, a "novel" about that Kike whatsisname - is it Blumberg? Name escapes me now, the one who built that occult building in London.</div>

In all fairness, that could be any building!!! There are so many "occult" buildings in London (And New York. And Washington D.C.) Jokes aside, Does she cite sources/credentials/etc.? I couldn't find anything on her. I'm askng you because 90% of authors on this subject are speculators who want to write the next Da Vinci code. Which ones would you recommend?

As I said, her body of work mysteriously disappeared off the internet after her death (her own website content). She was a thorough and credible researcher, I would describe her as an academic, an occult historian. I have only read the 3 I mentioned so cannot comment about the others. I followed all her interviews for years. The fact she's dead (after saying she was not suicidal) should be enough of a clue that she was onto something. I would advise starting with a few interviews, then decide if you want to invest in any books. I think the 2nd one below talks about Genuflect<br>

			<div class="content">No,at the top,it's all jews. The closest thing to a non-jew at the top is crypto-jews. They have many tiers of slaves,but at the top,100% kosher. Here's how it works out.<br>
<br>
Normies- These fuckers are simply lied to. They've been lied to all their lives and they don't think to question it because "how could anyone get away with telling lies that big for so long?" Because their lazy asses never looked anything up. They're ignorant but also set in their ways and scared of the concept of a government that stands against them. These are the sheep. They don't want to wake up.<br>
<br>
Useful idiots- These dipshits are directly involved with something the jews are into. Communists,"liberals",socjus,"conservatives","open mined Christians",the list goes on. They don't really know what's going on,but they're in some group or another the jews use to control narratives and drum up bullshit as needed. The low rent thugs and mob bosses of their "grass roots" bullshit machine. It serves to not only put idiots to use,but help them keep an eye on real revolutionaries who actually do want to change things and putting them to work for the jews.<br>
<br>
Politicians- The only real power in any country is the political class. They,like the useful idiots,are kept in the dark about the jews' plans,but they get to see more of the big picture. They still have no idea what the jews are up to,tho. They simply want to keep the power they've got and enjoy the ride and assume the jews won't fuck over the country too bad or believe the jews will make efforts to save them if everything goes horribly wrong. They are mistaken.<br>
<br>
So you see,it's all jews and their puppets. They might let their goyim slaves think they know what's up,but they don't really. And yes,the higher up slaves are scumbags. There's a reason for that. They select for scumbags because only scumbags will do what the jews want. Anyone who'd go along with the jews' real plans would be too insane to trust with this shit.<br>
<br>
So no,it's just jews at the top. They don't dare share power with anyone on this because it means letting them in where they can actually stop it. And the very fact I have to explain the jews are super tribalistic shows you haven't been paying attention.<br>
<br>
As for why the leaders let them in,well,money and deals. You have to understand the jews are merchants and their primary stock is bullshit and money laundering. They rob one country blind to pay off another to let them in. They've amassed huge fortunes this way for centuries. They will declare they are the poorest of the poor but they are richer than any gentile could ever dream. Some people didn't get the memo or just didn't believe a group of people could be so evil. They soon find out they are wrong.<br>
<br>
They also like starting wars and causing strife. The black plague? The jews paid lepers to spread the plague around. Most people didn't like hanging around lepers so they were basically invisible. And they were usually mad at the world because of their condition. Once they caught the lepers,they quickly squealed on the jews. Did you know most organized crime families were jewish? (((Hollywood))) told you they were "italian". Guess why. They have ways,evil ways,of getting in. By hook or by crook.<br>
<br>
You're forgetting,probably on purpose,that I mentioned JEWISH DOCTORS. You're also ignoring jewish communists have been eroding the medical institutions for over a hundred years. Longer if you count other countries. The jews LOVE to give poison to aryans and call it medicine. It's so bad,many doctors are trained in incorrect techniques thinking this is the proper way to handle a health problem. They don't even know they've been trained wrong. Some always figure it out,but they're written off as "kooks" by the mainstream medical industry. They run the schools that teach the doctors. Get it?<br>
<br>
Ok,you wanna talk about WW1 and 2? Ok. WW1 was started by Austro-Hungray. Yet it was Germany that took the full brunt of the repercussions. Why? Because jews didn't control Germany. They needed to weaken it and plunge it into poverty to take over. WW2 was started when Hitler stopped the jewsih communist take over of Germany and started reversing the damage they'd done. The jews declared war on Hitler in 1933. They also have a long history of hating Germany because they kept seeing through their crap. Look up Martin Luther some time. A GERMAN professor who started the Protestant movement and wrote the book "The Jews and Their Lies". And no one holds a grudge like a jew. They're still pissed at Rome for kicking them out of Israel. So yeah,there's a lot of reasons jews hate Germany.<br>
<br>
For every ONE person that would wake up,thousands would remain asleep. Those are losing numbers. But yeah,jew conspiracy chatter is up. That's why we're here. I wasn't here until a few years ago. It's up. It's spreading. People are getting armed and getting ready. Even if they don't know (((who))) the enemy is yet.</div>

I have this hunch that the vaccine has the purpose of sterilizing people. It wouldn't be the first time in which vaccines are used to sterilize people. Why would they push this vaccine so much, when ~99% of the population does not need it? The virus is real, vaccines do work, but this is suspicious as fuck.
</div></blockquote>

You might find this interesting. Before Voat was taken down I created a thread on the Askvoat sub inquiring about this very thing, and received quite an answer - <br>
<br>
"How accurate and/or possible is this Anon's take on mRNA vaccine tech?"<br>
<br>
(I was asking about this screen grab) - <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/ghmafb.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/ghmafb.jpg</a><br>

Scientist here. I agree with this assessment. In fact, autoimmune disease is a very well documented cause of infertility in males. The testes have a blood testes barrier similar to your blood brain barrier that prevents immune cells from getting in and destroying your sperm. This is because the process of gametogenesis causes your DNA to recombine, so the resulting sperm, although mostly similar to you, still has some differences that can cause autoimmune reaction if it isn't protected. The same goes for eggs, but the phenomenon is more commonly observed in men who have infertility. When a woman becomes pregnant, the fetus also has foreign DNA so it's important for her immune system not to attack the fetus as well. How or why the fetus is protected is not well understood, but potentially, an autoimmune reaction can cause the fetus to be aborted as well. However, this is not something that is unique to mRNA vaccines, as it can happen with other vaccines, and it can also happen spontaneously if the person has a genetic predisposition to it, usually related to certain HLA haplotypes.<br>
<br>
It's likely that if sterilization occurred, it would not happen in everyone, it'd most likely be dependent on specific HLA haplotypes and other factors. Notably, different races do have different HLA haplotypes, which is what they use to match people for organ donation, so you can imagine how this can be engineered to disproportionately affect certain races. Obviously, doing this would be very unethical and no one would openly publish that they have accomplished such a feat. It's most likely done in secret government labs or secret corporate labs, but it is definitely very possible.<br>
<br>
My reply:<br>
<br>
Excellent answer, thanks for taking the time. You said that "this can be engineered to disproportionately affect certain races." Would what you're talking about have any relation to the claims made by this guy?<br>

<br>
Your HLA haplotype can be found if they include these regions in the sequencing. Most likely they would because the HLA regions are quite important for tracing things like race. There's also a list of several genomic loci that the FBI use for DNA fingerprinting. These are generally also included and are how they are using these databases to find criminals through relatives that have used these services.</div>

So people on 4chan do know, people in the early 20th century knew... but mdoern day politicians simply don't? No one told them? No attempts at rebellion, exposure or competition? If we know it, they probably do to. Biden hinted at it many times. Nixon spoke about it. Eisenhower wrote letters on it, so did Patton. They knew the jews were up to something. Charles Lindbergh and Neville Chamberlain knew too. Churchill knew as well. Everybody knows. And they had enough power to stop them. It's unrealistic to think they can absolutely rule the world uncontested, without inner or external opposition, something we haven't seen happening even in the strictest totalitarianisms of the world.<br>
<br>
You don't have to explain it to me; I know a lot more than you think I do about talmud, kabbalah, messianism, tribalism, history of jews, the holocaust, slavery, works on the jews (jews and their lies, entdeckes judentum, E. Michael Jones, Protocols, Maurice Pinay, Pranaitis, Traian Romanescu, Zionism vs. Bolshevism, etc.). I've seen TGSNT, Europa the last battle, and other docs. I don't deny the jewish attempt for world dominion; they openly stated it themselves in several occasions (I'm going to be posting about it). I'm saying they are not the only players. The rest is all true; they do hate white people, they do hate christianity, they are like a sect and they want to "diversify" the world.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ok,you wanna talk about WW1 and 2? Ok. WW1 was started by Austro-Hungray. Yet it was Germany that took the full brunt of the repercussions. Why? Because jews didn't control Germany. They needed to weaken it and plunge it into poverty to take over. WW2 was started when Hitler stopped the jewsih communist take over of Germany and started reversing the damage they'd done. The jews declared war on Hitler in 1933. </div></blockquote>

WW1 was inevitable. In geopolitics, there's a concept known as "balance of power". It states that no one, not even your allies, should become too strong, powerful or influential. It is more beneficial to have separate, weaker states, allies and factions than to have a strong one, because it can represent a threat to your own faction, state, country, religion, etc. That is why, during the Thirty years war, Cardinal Richelieu allied with the protestants; the idea was to weaken the Habsburgs, the dynasty which held both the Crown of Spain, but also the Holy Roman Empire. Their power was too much, and they were surrounding France.<br>
<br>
Politics is a constant competition for dominance and power. When you have too many powerful factions, war is bound to happen because it is assumed that if you don't strike first, the other side will. Before WW1, you had the middle East dominated by the ottomans, Germany becoming a superpower and Russia on its way to become the largest economy given their population. War was inevitable at that point. Jews didn't control Imperial Russia then, that's why they pulled the Bolshevik revolution (which wasn't only jewish, but it was funded by jews, carried out by many jews and also didn't persecute jews while persecuting orthodox christianity). Austria-Hungary did start the way by pressing Serbia even after they conceded to their demands, but you don't see sanctions imposed on them. Germany didn't even think Austria Hungary would go for the war, that's why Kaiser Wilhelm went on a vacation during that time; he just didn't see that as a possibility.<br>
<br>
This is, of course, if we neglect the influence of the British who intercepted diplomatic telegrams and were seeking to start the war once and for all to get rid of their greatest competitor and to establish Cecil Rhodes' idea of a secret, anglophile society that controls the world under a US-British union (see the WW1 conspiracy). When the war finished, with the help of the jews after the Balfour declaration, Britain didn't give them Palestine as promised, and Freemasonry achieved their goal of establishing republics as opposed to monarchies, as per their ideology. Republics decentralize power, which makes military power weaker since there is no possibility of absolute control for war.<br>
<br>
WW2 was about the same thing; you had three competing blocks; republican, democratic free markets, fascism and nationalism and socialism, which was expanding. Germany recovered after the degeneracy of Weimar during Hitler's regime; which was the right thing to do. The west tried to push Germany to war so they would have a justification for war in the eyes of the public, and they allied with the jews, promising them a jewish state, and asking them to use their propaganda and funds to help the war, just like they did in WW1. Just like before, they said that Hitler wanted to take over the world, just like the Kaiser allegedly wanted to take over America. They invented atrocity propaganda, like the rape of Belgium and the Holocaust, to foster an anti-german sentiment in the populace. Eventually, Germany got split between the western and the eastern sides; the communist side has a compass in its flag. Says a lot about which society had a key role in all of this.<br>
<br>
Even after the war, the US didn't support Israel until they established themselves as the leading power in the middle East. If they were under total control of jews, they would have had their jewish state right before WW1.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For every ONE person that would wake up,thousands would remain asleep. Those are losing numbers. But yeah,jew conspiracy chatter is up. That's why we're here. I wasn't here until a few years ago. It's up. It's spreading. People are getting armed and getting ready. Even if they don't know (((who))) the enemy is yet.</div></blockquote>

Jews are only one of our enemies. And again, it's not even all of them. It's a race thing either; the problem with jews is not their genes but their culture that is diametrically opposed to everything we hold dear; our white, christian heritage. And if you think christianity is judaism with extra step, you don't know what you're talking about. And I say this as a non-christian.<br>
<br>
I know you're gonna hate me for this, but we all know that your jewish neighbours, classmates and average jews aren't doing this. Go and visit the old jewish lady in your building and ask her if she's all for globalism, diversity, censorship and all that. It's the upper tiers of international zionism, banks, media and communism. Orthodox judaism isn't even that common in Israel, where they already have abortion and are the gayest country on earth, so this isn't a purely religious conspiracy. That doesn't mean jews don't hate white people, the west and christianity, they do and should live far away from us. Their talmud is downright "hate speech", and they've shown more than a 109 times that they cannot integrate. The real culprits are not average jews who live in New York, surrounded by "diversity". It's not their children, it's not their women. It's the Rothschilds, Kissinger, Kuhn Loeb, Warburg, Epstein, the Mossad, the ADL, the zionists, etc.</div>

I think they'll probably sterilize "useless eaters" in India, Africa, Haiti, etc. They've been doing that for a long time. I've read about the vaccines for rubella inserting large amounts of gonadotrophin to trigger an immune reaction. This same hormone is responsible for the attachment of the embryo to the uterine walls, so if your own body rejects it, it renders the person sterile.</div>

			<div class="content">And what happened to those people? Oh,right,they're all dead,thrown out of their positions of power,or towed the line after some bad shit happened to them. Funny how that works out,ain't it. They all came far too late to stop the jews from gaining power. They had the power to get Woodrow Wilson in office and set up the Federal Reserve for them in 1913. It was already too late by the time these fucks came along. The thing about the jews you need to understand is they don't stop. They're always working to undermine everyone. So while you're relaxing,sleeping,eating,fucking,the jew is at work to destroy everything you hold dear. They can cover a lot of ground that way.<br>
<br>
The jews are the only ones at the top. They have tons of puppets. Many too drug addled,sex obsessed,or just plain broken to stop them. They aren't taking in the competent,and they don't let the puppets actually run anything. They give them their orders and they march as they were trained to. They assassinate presidents,so no one is really safe from them. You ask me how they don't get it. You don't get it yet. Not completely. Your "It's not all the jews" bullshit shows you're either a shill or you just haven't seen enough shit yet to understand. It's the jews,all the jews,and nothing but the jews.<br>
<br>
Ok,so you're saying jews can run,fund,and have the force of numbers to take over Russia,but they can't run the world with a bunch of puppets and money. Is that about right? And while you acknowledge the jews doing all kinds of shit during WW1 and WW2,you don't see how they manipulated all these events. Also,as Russia was becoming a super power,under jewish control,no one seemed interested in stopping that. A more suspicious person might find that odd.<br>
<br>
But yeah,many nations rose to power with no massive war against them. So that idea is out the window. And to make the point clearer,Wilson was their goy. He gave them the federal reserve and he brought America into the war at the behest of the jews after they sold us to the british to help them win in exchange for Israel. Which they did start establishing right after the war. But I'm sure the ever innocent jews didn't have any hand in starting the war for their own gain. Just because they'd done it before and since doesn't mean they did it here,right?<br>
<br>
Christianity is jewish control. They wiped out our original deities and replaced them with their own. And they did it by the sword. You became christian or you died as heretics. They have turned us against each other time and again. You can make whatever arguments about what the origins of christianity were. Whether or not you think it's worth saving as a legit religion. But what it is now is control. It is completely jewed.<br>
<br>
Also,protip: 7th month of the year. They're all in on it. They've all read the talmud and it wasn't a deal breaker for them. Fuck you.</div>

Show me proof. You're telling me the "competent" people aren't doing anything? their puppets are drug addicts... but what about their children, their families, and all that? How long have they been broken puppets? No, these peole are functional, they're not stupid and they don't give a crap about rabbis. Some of them were funding the nazis, so they knew about jews. How did jews take over the world without the pre-existing elite doing anything?<br>

Yes, it was called the Cold War. Even then, the fact that they allied with the soviet union shows you they didn't mind socialism that much; because. If the jews already controlled everything... <strong class="text-strong">Why didn't they establish Israel after WW1?</strong><br>

I never said anything about massive wars. Every regime has conspirators and opposition, willing to sell you out and take your place. You're telling me hundreds of billionaires who are gentiles didn't try to do anything, and complied with the same people that want to destroy them. If we know about the conspiracy, so do they. You're telling me they didn't about white genocide? Why would they comply with it? How come the royal families of the world (which are not jewish) ally against the jews?<br>
<br>
Also: Hitler was an artist with some military background. How come a dude like him rose to lead the world's greatest superpower and fight the jews who, according to you, had absolute power? Didn't the nobility of Imperial Germany try to stop him? Where did he get the money? You're not playing with a full deck of cards here.<br>

Not at all. Christianity was the driving force against jews and muslims, uniting all european peoples. The decline of the west is correlated with the abandonment of christian values. And I'm not a christian, in case you're wondering. That is why jews seethe at christianity and seek to destroy it.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also,protip: 7th month of the year. They're all in on it. They've all read the talmud and it wasn't a deal breaker for them. Fuck you.
</div></blockquote>

You're very pissed off. How are you any different from the "shut up nazi" crowd? Get out of 4cahn for a while and think for yourself. Ask yourself these questions; why do jews spend so much money on propaganda if they already control everything? Why haven't they shut down 4chan and other websites which are redpilling people by the thousands? Why aren't they enforcing their own dictatorship openly, instead of doing it covertly? How do they manage to not have whistleblowers? Why have they spent years and years fighting against palestinians and other muslim garbage, if they are so powerful? You give them too much credit. No one can pull off a flawless plan, around the world, for centuries by using the same people they seek to destroy. It's ridiculous. Where's all their money, exactly? Can you name the richest people, and see if they are kikes?</div>

			<div class="content">Churchhill and Chamberlain were bought and paid for. Lindberg's kid was kidnapped and murdered. Guess who did that. Patton noticed the jews and their shenanigans and he was killed in a "car accident". I shouldn't have to tell you how 2 jewish journalists got Nixon kicked out of office. Are you starting to see a pattern here?<br>
<br>
The simple fact is the jews have many ways to get to the elites as long as they can move freely in a society. Once they had the fed,they had unlimited funds. Anyone who could be bought off,was. That gets you a LOT of power with the "right people". It also buys you all the media. Now you control the flow of mainstream information. You can just tell people what to think. You're the one telling them about it and they think you're honest. You can basically tell them anything.<br>
<br>
So.one of the tribe is in trouble with the law? Get high price lawyer and buy the judge. That didn't work? Bribe a guard to look the other way while you get them out and leave a corpse made up to look like them. There's corruptible people in every level of the system. Most don't ask why,they don't care. They LOOK FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT and put them in positions of power. People who don't ask questions,just take the money and keep your mouth shut.<br>
<br>
Because it takes time to set up a country. You have to get rid of the people who are already there without alerting anyone. You have to get the resolutions through the bureaucracy quietly,which takes time even if you own the bureaucracy. It all takes time,but it was moving that way right after WW1.<br>
<br>
The cold war started only after Stalin began purging jews from the government. There's a reason Russia went from being our "greatest ally" in WW2 to the "red menace" of the 50s. Stalin wanted power for himself. Which means either the jews played ball or got a necking. Once again,Russia only became a problem in the eyes of the jewish run media when jews no longer ran Russia.<br>
<br>
Most didn't know about the jews as they largely focused on getting control of the media. Once they had that,they could slander anyone or anything. Also,you might want to take a closer look at some of those royal families before you make that call about them not being jews. As for Hitler,well,he knew the jews and their ways to power. Once you have that,all you need are some loyal men to follow you and you can easily root the jews out. He got the funding for his new government by arresting and ransoming off a Rothschild. Got something like 20 million in gold. Which is about the time jews declared war on Germany. Unfortunately,he,like you,believed "not all jews were evil". Had a jewish doctor. Who got him hooked on meth. But hey,not all jews,right?<br>
<br>
They seethe at anything they don't control. And while they have control of the Vatican,they don't control all of christianity and a lot of people are noticing the stuff in the bible about jews. But yeah,most of the churches are under jewish control. There's always outliers and rebels,but they control the main church and label the outliers as "kooks". As for what brought white people together,it's usually attacks from without. The huns,the nigger pirates,the moose-lambs.the jews. They've always had a way of bringing us together. For self-defense. And as we saw with both world wars,that "unity" was quickly thrown out the window when there was profit to be made by selling yourself to the jews. So how "united" are we,really?<br>
<br>
Because maintaining that control requires the people to remain asleep. They wouldn't accept jewish control if they really knew what it meant.<br>
<br>
What makes you think 4chan isn't just another level of control? Haven't you heard of the term "controlled opposition"? They're making lists of people who go there,you know.<br>
<br>
Because sooner or later,the people have to recognize who their bosses are. And they've been building up to this for a long time. But mostly,they're trying to start a civil war to grab more power.<br>
<br>
They have had whistleblowers. Look up Gary Webb some time. See what happens to them. Discredited in the media until they could safely kill him. Seth Rich went the other way. Killed then discredited.<br>
<br>
Because they want Israel and that means fighting them for it. Or rather,having us fight them for it. Trump derailed that gravy train a lot and that's one of the reasons they wanted him gone.<br>
<br>
Who said it was flawless? There's a reason we know about it and it's because of the leaks and missteps. They just have control of the media that allows them to lie en mass to the lazy public who don't double check that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
The money is all over the world,but mostly in the central banks. You see,the money is actually worthless. As is gold and other "precious" metals and goods. We're in a post scarcity economy. So they have to create scarcity to keep it going. Which is why they're trying to shut down fracking and the oil pipe line. If people realized oil is the second most common liquid on the planet,they might realize that oil isn't scarce. And the dollar is currently based on oil. So,you can see the problem.<br>
<br>
But I don't have to tell jew that.</div>

I am. I don't deny the jewish questions. I'm telling you that they aren't the only ones. These people knew about the jews and probably got killed because of that, there's no denying of that. What about Walt Disney or Ford? Mel Gibson? David Irving? Farrakhan? Ice cube? Damn, they could give Ursula Haverbeck covid. There are plenty of known antisemites who are still around, doing well. Why didn't they kill the Bush dynasty or the royal family, who funded the nazis? See Wall Street and the rise of Hitler. How about entire arab countries who hate the jews? Why haven't they gotten rid of all the palestinians by now?<br>

That is true. But these people do care about their families and about retaining power. How did the pre-jew elites allow them to take over without any resistance? They just simply decided to give their centuries-old legacy to the jews? Where are they now? Most of the world is 98% non-jewish, if not more. And you're telling me 2% or less control everything without any serious opposition? They're lacking in everything; numbers, money, influence and they are historically reviled by people. There's always a chance to take them out. Jews tend to intermarry, so the jewish fundamentalists grow thinner by the day. Israel is a tiny country which depends on America to subsist. They had to kill Kennedy because he was investigating their nuclear arsenal (among many other things).<br>
<br>
If the jews were too powerful, the principle of balance of power would have led countries to destroy them.<br>

Why would it take them time? They already had the Fed, they already had the Balfour declaration, they already had the media. Why not then?<br>

Once again,Russia only became a problem in the eyes of the jewish run media when jews no longer ran Russia. </div></blockquote>

This is absolutely false. The cold war lasted until the 90's (at least). And yes, Stalin was killed by the jews.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Most didn't know about the jews as they largely focused on getting control of the media. Once they had that,they could slander anyone or anything. Also,you might want to take a closer look at some of those royal families before you make that call about them not being jews. As for Hitler,well,he knew the jews and their ways to power. Once you have that,all you need are some loyal men to follow you and you can easily root the jews out. He got the funding for his new government by arresting and ransoming off a Rothschild. Got something like 20 million in gold. Which is about the time jews declared war on Germany. Unfortunately,he,like you,believed "not all jews were evil". Had a jewish doctor. Who got him hooked on meth. But hey,not all jews,right? </div></blockquote>

How did Hitler, who didn't have any funds at the moment, manage to kidnap a Rothschild? So Hitler only had a few fans, but no money. What was the rest of Germany doing? Maybe, just maybe, the ransom was a way of getting Rothschild money without it looking like he was being funded by the jews. Maybe that was part of the Havaara agreement? I cannot prove it, but it doesn't make sense that a nobody from humble could surpass the nobility and the jews that took over Weimar, kidnap a Rothschild and lead a world superpower into the greatest war in history. If he had a jewish doctor, that's because he's either stupid or he's not telling the truth. And I stand by what I said; not all jews are in on the conspiracy and frankly, the elite jews don't give a single fuck about the average jew. They tend to hate the goyim, but most jews (at least outside America) have assimilated and don't observe their religions. Do you think they read the talmud? No, they simply eat kosher, celebrate hannukah and other jewish stuff. Jews can jew other jews. The problem with that is that the only jews that get pogrommed are the ones who didn't have anything to do with the conspiracy. The powerful ones are always safe.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What makes you think 4chan isn't just another level of control? Haven't you heard of the term "controlled opposition"? They're making lists of people who go there,you know. </div></blockquote>

So controlled opposition waking up thousands of people to the jewish issue? They only thing they do is blame them on terrorism, but it's not enough. It's still up and running. It's backfiring a lot. It's full of glownigs and jews, that's true, but they cannot control it entirely.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Because sooner or later,the people have to recognize who their bosses are. And they've been building up to this for a long time. But mostly,they're trying to start a civil war to grab more power. </div></blockquote>

They already have infinite money and have no opposition. What do they have to fear, if everything is under control? Why not just take the middle East once and for all?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Who said it was flawless? There's a reason we know about it and it's because of the leaks and missteps. They just have control of the media that allows them to lie en mass to the lazy public who don't double check that sort of thing. </div></blockquote>

So, if it is not flawless, how come they excercise uncontested power? How come no one planned anything against them. It wouldn't take much. It's not easy, but it doesn't cost that much. You need people from the elites coming out and exposing what they do. The media manipulates most people (who wish to be deceived) but it's getting less powerful. They don't control internet either. Most of the world is not jewish. There are more than enough resources to counter the jews.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The money is all over the world,but mostly in the central banks. You see,the money is actually worthless. As is gold and other "precious" metals and goods. We're in a post scarcity economy. So they have to create scarcity to keep it going. Which is why they're trying to shut down fracking and the oil pipe line. If people realized oil is the second most common liquid on the planet,they might realize that oil isn't scarce. And the dollar is currently based on oil. So, you can see the problem. </div></blockquote>

Capitalism isn't about scarcity. Even if we feed all people in the world (which we can totally do), capitalism wouldn't disappear. This assumes they're pulling a massive fraud and no one noticed or said anything. Fiduciary money is widely studied, and it is considered a valid currency by economists. I'm not saying it is, they say it. The problem is that it relies on how much people trust that currency based on the economy, which makes it volatile. Not to mention unlimited money printing if necessary.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>But I don't have to tell jew that.</div></blockquote>

<em class="text-italics">Anyone who disagrees with me is a jew!!!!!!</em> Bitch, I have more foreskin than any one of you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If everything were lost, their propaganda would be unnecessary. If you and I were at war, I'd try to appear more powerful than I really am. It's a basic psy-op; shock and awe. The pufferfish puffing up to scare predators away. Small dogs barking loud.</div>

You keep telling yourself that,jew. Makes you easier to spot.
</div></blockquote>

"Anyone who doesn't agree with me is a jew, shill or glownigger"<br>
<br>
I might argue you're involuntarily shilling for jews  by making others believe they have uncontested power. That's not how politics work. If you want power, you need money and people. Displease them and you'll have them gladly kick your kosher ass to the curb. Jew or not, people ultimately care about their own interests.</div>
