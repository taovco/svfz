			<div class="content"><a href="https://insidethevatican.com/news/newsflash/letter-37-friday-november-13-2020-sankt-gallen/" class="postlink">https://insidethevatican.com/news/newsf ... kt-gallen/</a><br>
<br>
This terrific piece contains multiple links to research and reporting on this lynchpin of the globalist pedo-Satanist cabal involving the manipulation of papal elections, the sheltering of abusers within the Church in order to systematically destroy not just the faith of victims and families, but seminaries and thus the priesthood itself, the collusion with "Progressive" politicians in the US and Europe and the brutal narrative control employed against whistleblowers Cardinal Vigano, and James Grein. It shows how the McCarrick Report is a deft propaganda tool obfuscating the essential question of who promoted McCarrick.<br>
<br>
This research may shed light on "Godfather III".<br>
<br>
Incidentlally, the Sankt Gallen mentioned -- the town where the conclave manipulators who put Francis on the Chair of Peter met to lay their plots, and to which McCarrick regularly traveled throughout his climb to the heights of power -- is also home to the headquarters of Aleister Crowley's OTO (Ordo Templis Orientalis), which Dr. Taylor Marshall has documented in his excellent book <em class="text-italics">Infiltration</em>. Here's an excerpt:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The official biographers of Danneels explained that “the election of Bergoglio was prepared in St. Gallen” because the “election of Bergoglio corresponded with the aims of St. Gallen, on that there is no doubt. And the outline of its program was that of Danneels and his confreres, who had been discussing it for ten years.”142 Danneels himself referred to the group as the Sankt Gallen “mafia.”143 <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00BF00">Why Sankt Gallen, Switzerland? Sankt Gallen has historical roots in European Communism. </span><br>
<br>
Originally the town grew around the missionary base of an Irish missionary monk named Saint Gallus along the River Steinach in A.D. 612. Saint Othmar established a monastery on the site in 720. The dairy-farming town grew up around the abbey. By the beginning of the 1900s, however, the region became associated with ritual Satanism and Communism, as shall be demonstrated below. <br>
<br>
Vladimir Lenin used Switzerland as his headquarters and place of exile on and off between 1903 and 1917. During the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, in which Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the throne, Lenin remained in exile in Switzerland. He inspired his revolution by having his writings and articles printed in Switzerland and smuggled into Russia. Encouraged by the February Revolution, he decided to return to Russia. Fritz Platten organized Lenin’s return to Russia. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF00">Platten was a native of Sankt Gallen — a Freemason and a Communist. </span>He arranged to have Lenin sneaked out of Switzerland and through Germany in a sealed train car and then to find a ferry to Sweden and through Finland, where he would arrive back in Russia as leader apparent. <br>
<br>
Our Lady of Fatima predicted these horrors in July 1917, when she warned the children that “Russia will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church. The good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have much to suffer, various nations will be annihilated.” Led by Vladimir Lenin, the Bolsheviks violently seized power in November 1917 (one month after the Miracle of the Sun in Fatima) and murdered Tsar Nicholas II and his family on 17 July 1918. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF00">Fritz Platten not only smuggled Lenin out of Switzerland back to Moscow; he also saved his life. </span>Platten was in the backseat of Lenin’s car when it was attacked in Petrograd on 14 January 1918. When gunfire rang out, Platten grabbed Lenin by the head and pushed him down. His hand was grazed by a bullet and covered in blood.144 <span style="color:#00FF00">Without this intervention by this native of Sankt Gallen, the world may not have known the horrors of Marxist-Leninism. </span><br>
<br>
Platten also founded the Communist International in 1919 as a means for encouraging world Communism. As a representative of the Swiss Communist Party, he spent much of his life in the Soviet Union. It seems that Platten is the link between Leninism and the origin of Sankt Gallen as a hotbed for Communism and dissent. <br>
<br>
The infamous occultist Aleister Crowley (1875–1947) and his adherents also possess a ritualistic connection to Sankt Gallen. <br>
<br>
Crowley was a pioneer in recreational drug experimentation, a bisexual, an esoteric occultist, poet, painter, and outdoorsman. He was derided as the “wickedest man in the world” and labeled a Satanist. He was not formally a Satanist but was a self-proclaimed prophet and founder of the religion of Thelema. As an enthusiastic mountaineer, Crowley spent much of his time in Switzerland. His religion centered on “sex-magick” of the Order of Templars of the Orient (OTO), of which Crowley was a member. <br>
<br>
Originally OTO was European Freemasonry, but under the leadership of Crowley, OTO was reorganized around the Law of Thelema: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.”145 Unlike explicit Freemasonry, the OTO includes an ecclesiastical and liturgical “church”: the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (EGC) or Gnostic Catholic Church. The purpose of this church is to restore Christianity to its original status as a “solar-phallic religion.” <br>
<br>
The OTO is a phallic cult, and its oldest lodge is in Switzerland. The OTO also celebrates the rite of Liber XV or the Gnostic Mass, which Crowley wrote in Moscow in 1913. The liturgy calls for five officers: a priest, a priestess, a deacon, and two acolytes, called “children” and culminates in the consummation of a faux Eucharistic rite and the consumption of wine and a cake of light (made of menstrual fluid) after which the recipient recites: “There is no part of me that is not of the gods!” <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF00">It seems that the Diocese of Sankt Gallen allegedly assisted the OTO in celebrating this false Mass</span>. <br>
<br>
The Swiss-born Hermann Joseph Metzger became the patriarch of the Gnostic Catholic Church in 1960.146 He dressed in a white cassock and zucchetto just like the Catholic pope. He also served as head of his Order of the Illuminati, head of his Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua. <span style="color:#00FF00">Allegedly, “Patriarch” Metzger and the Swiss OTO acquired three thousand hosts from 1963 to 1967 from a Catholic convent. Whether these hosts were consecrated is not stated. Moreover, they claim that they received incense from the chief sacristan at the Sankt Gallen Cathedral and wine directly from Joseph Hasler, bishop of Sankt Gallen and Council father at the Second Vatican Council from 1963 to 1965</span>.147 <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">In 1954, the headquarters of OTO moved to Appenzell, Switzerland, which is thirty-one miles from the township of Sankt Gallen proper. </span>The name Appenzell derives from the Latin Abbatis cella, or “abbot’s cell.” Although geographically within the canton of Sankt Gallen, Appenzell maintains its independence, having rebelled against the abbot of Sankt Gallen in 1403. Going back to the 1360s, the lay inhabitants of the town of Sankt Gallen and the town of Appenzell had been in conflict with the prince abbot of Sankt Gallen over grazing rights and tithes due to the abbey.<br>
<br>
To counter their resistance, Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln acquired the direct support and patronage of the Austrian House of Habsburg (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=habsburg%20coat%20of%20arms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS877US877&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0QtI8BKABqFwoTCOD3tIHZ5-4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAK&amp;biw=1519&amp;bih=763" class="postlink">pizzagate researchers please note the "Y head" double eagle in the Hapsburg Coat of Arms</a>) against these towns under his ancient jurisdiction. In response, the township of Sankt Gallen submitted to the abbot, but Appenzell sought the support of the Old Swiss Confederation and staged a rebellion against the abbot in 1403. Appenzell retained its independence, and although it was sympathetic to Lutheran and Anabaptist preachers in the 1500s, it retained a Catholic majority. Oddly, Appenzell still civilly follows the Julian calendar and marks New Year’s Day accordingly on our 14 January. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF00"><strong class="text-strong">Appenzell, surrounded by the canton of Sankt Gallen, thus became the headquarters and capital of the OTO and Crowley’s religion of Thelema in 1954</strong>. It also operates the largest lodge of World Federation of Illuminati.148 </span><br>
<br>
Within this religion, the sex-magick techniques were taught by degree to initiates; for example the eighth degree of masturbation magic, the ninth degree of heterosexual magic, and the eleventh degree of anal sex magic.149 <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF00"><strong class="text-strong">The year 1954 corresponds to the activities of the young Theodore McCarrick in Sankt Gallen, Switzerland, as revealed in an interview between McCarrick’s child victim James Grein and me on 5 December 2018. Theodore McCarrick is the most notorious child molester and homosexual predator of the Catholic Church</strong></span>, having been removed from the College of Cardinals in 2018 and from the clerical state in 2019.<br>

			<div class="content">An interesting article on Hapsburg, Rothschild and DuPont inbreeding: <a href="https://therake.com/stories/code/pedigree-chums-a-history-of-aristocratic-incest/" class="postlink">https://therake.com/stories/code/pedigr ... ic-incest/</a><br>
<br>
What I find most interesting about this is the parallel phenomenon exorcists have repeatedly noted: that demons, aka "Generational Spirits", are also passed down through families. Here's an interesting lecture on that by psychologist and exorcist Fr. Chad Ripperger: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZDpMfT5Way8" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/ZDpMfT5Way8</a>. <br>
<br>
Drawing on both the experience of modern exorcists, and the work of people like Thomas Aquinas, he also notes that angels, good and bad, can manipulate matter -- including our DNA -- causing both illness and unusual ability. Ripperger has had multiple cases of people struggling with demonic obsession, infestation or even possession because they were raped by a family member and/or suffered SRA, or their parent or grandparent was.<br>
<br>
I am wondering if all these things are connected, if these elite families gain and retain their power by collaborating with demons.<br>
<br>

<em class="text-italics">Just read an interesting article in The Palm Beach Post, on the front page : "Uber passenger says driver raped her" When I started reading this alarm bells started ringing. Seems the alleged rapist Gary Timothy Kitchings was 'House Parent" at foster homes.Kitchings recently worked at the KidSafe Sanctuary in West Palm Beach and Place of Hope also in W Palm.He worked in foster homes in Florida,North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The story said Kitchings and his wife had been house parents at various organizations for 17 years BEGINNING AT FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS TOWN in Omaha Nebraska !! There's a photo with him alongside our Franklin buddy Oliver North. He publishes blogs where he discussed his "career as a behavior-modification specialist" He wrote one story about an aging assassin confronting a demon.Strange stuff.</em></div></blockquote>
