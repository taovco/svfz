			<div class="content">Having lived through a significant period of the introduction of ‘the permissive society’ in the UK I would say that the illusion of freedom of speech and lifestyle was carefully cultivated, but it was mostly illusory, an unfulfilled promise. <br>
<br>
For the most part the not inconsiderable opposition was silenced by a powerful and wide-ranging set of measures from relentless pushing of selected opinion formers in media and culture to character assassination and shaming of those who spoke up. All the changes of ‘modernity’ were applied to the impoverishment of the society and the individual in such a storm that most were too disorientated, undermined, and shocked to be able to form an effective resistance. <br>
<br>
Ultimately the blame lies with the majority who gave in to temptation, but the campaign to lead them was highly organised and relentless.<br>
<br>
In my opinion the first important step was to separate people from God, after that it was just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
But I believe that free speech is vital to our attempts to hold to whatever strength and virtue we have left.<br>
<br>
Free speech is the right on which all other rights depend.</div>

			<div class="content">Pornography,in and of itself,is not to blame for what happened. We've always held the beauty of the human form in high regard and covering one's body out of shame is something the jews had a hand in,I'm sure. Taking what is natural and beautiful and turning it into a "vice". Forbidding our natural desires to reproduce as "perversion" certainly wouldn't stop people from procreating or see procreation itself as "sinful".<br>
<br>
No,pornography,like most jewish schemes,is only one part of a bigger problem. Have you noticed it's getting harder and harder to find decent communal meeting places? Even before the plandemic,it seems classy night clubs with soft music and good food as well as room for dancing were on the way out. Slowly being replaced with "raves" and dive bars where the music is too loud to talk and various means to inhibit your ability to reason are plentiful.<br>
<br>
Churches got gay and let in pedo priests and became so permissive you can't even find a decent woman there anymore. I don't even think they can preach on morality anymore since none of them even seem to understand the concept. Few can articulate why it's bad to be gay. Fewer would even try.<br>
<br>
Lodges,gentlemen's clubs (NOT strip bars),and various clubs of all kinds seem to be just gone or among people who were already friends. Movie theaters are just propaganda houses and offer nothing of worth. Even the degenerate filth of our youth was far better than the shit they throw on the screen these days. And yes,I thought entertainment was going downhill before I was red pilled. It didn't make sense to me to spend hundreds of millions on garbage storylines that don't make sense. Fortunately,after learning the truth about (((Hollywood))),I wonder no longer. And even those are gone now.<br>
<br>
What killed the shopping mall? It became too much of a communal center. People could go there for dates,to "just hand out",much like the old night clubs. They had to go. So,sabotage the anchor stores,drive up the rents,make the whole thing unsustainable. One less place to go.<br>
<br>
It's easy to blame losing interest in the consumer culture for not wanting to go out,since you don't want to buy that crap. But the truth is,there's no where to go anymore. For anything. Where do you go to have a good time now? The only answer I have anymore is "home". Work on projects,relax,play whatever games I have that haven't pissed me off yet.<br>
<br>
Porn didn't do those things. The jews did.</div>
