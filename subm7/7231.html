			<div class="content">In this vid, Steven Brown (former crime boss turned Truther and thorn in the side of the establishment) names names. This is not the only vid of his where he alludes to Dutch pedo politicians.<br>
In this one, they talk about the Dutch child protective services basically creating a catalogue of vulnerable kids for politicians to abuse. They also mention the high number of children in care who go missing.<br>
<br>
Steve is an interesting character. He's best known for a famous video clip in which he kicks insufferable cunt and now deceased (assassinated) crime reporter Peter R de Vries up the behind. Steve also proved that de Vries was on the payroll of a notorious crime group. De Vries was in with all the shady politicians and dodgy cops.<br>

A political party promoting paedophilia has been reactivated in the Netherlands <br>
<br>
<br>
In the Netherlands, there exists a political party whose goals are the legalisation of, sexual intercourse with <br>
children, child pornography and necrophilia. It is called the Party for Neighbourly Love, Freedom, and Diversity <br>
(Partij voor Naastenliefde, Vrijheid en Diversiteit or PNVD). The PNVD also calls for “sexual contact with animals<br>
 to become legal again” as well as “legalisation of necrophilia if the deceased has explicitly given his written permission to do so”.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Rebecca Project for Human Rights - The Pedophia Case of JORIS DEMMINK a High Level Dutch Ministry of<br>
 Justice Official The Rebecca Project is working to shine a light on perpetrators of violence and draw attention when <br>
victims’ pleas are ignored, including its investigation of a case involving alleged sexual abuse of children by a senior <br>
Ministry of Justice official in the Netherlands, Joris Demmink, who has eluded investigation, raising grave questions <br>
about the seriousness with which governments, are actually combating human trafficking and pedophilia/sexual <br>
exploitation of children <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rebecca Project for Human Rights Urges U.S. Congress to Bar Accused Pedophile, Dutch Justice Ministry Secretary General Joris Demmink from the United States, Freeze His U.S. Assets, and Examine Cover-Up Pending Investigation by Dutch Authorities<br>
<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON, Oct.  2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Rebecca Project for Human Rights today condemned press reports indicating Dutch Justice Minister Ivo Opstelten has notified the Dutch parliament that calls for an investigation into pedophile accusations against Dutch Ministry Secretary-General Joris Demmink have been<br>
 rejected.  In a statement highly critical of the Dutch Justice Minister’s decision to not pursue an investigation into the allegations of victims in both the Netherlands and Turkey, the prominent Washington-based anti-human trafficking organization called upon the U.S. Congress to not only bar Demmink from entering the United States, but to freeze any of Demmink’s U.S.-based assets,pending an investigation by Dutch authorities.  In addition, the Rebecca Project urged the U.S. Congress to investigate which Dutch authorities have conspired to allow Demmink to remain free.<br>
<br>
The Rebecca Project for Human Rights Exe Director Imani Walker and Policy Director Kwame Fosu issued the following statement: “Allegations of sexual violence by Dutch Justice Ministry Secretary-General Joris Demmink continue to remain unaccounted for, despite victims of Demmink’s crimes, in both the Netherlands and Turkey, demanding justice. Even calls by U.S. Congressmen for Dutch and Turkish authorities to investigate these accusations have not resulted in action, which is a betrayal of the violence these victims endured. Even a U.S. Helsinki Commission briefing on child sex trafficking, during which Chairman and Congressman Christopher Smith (R-NJ) called upon Dutch authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into child sex trafficking accusations against Joris Demmink, has not instilled into Dutch authorities the seriousness of the crimes in question. Until Dutch Justice Minister fulfills his duty as the top Dutch law enforcement official and demands a thorough and complete investigation into the accusations,<br>
 the U.S. Congress must take steps to bar Joris Demmink from entering the United States and to freeze Demmink’s U.S.-based assets. An accused pedophile cannot be allowed to victimize any children in the United States or use his U.S. assets to fund an escape from criminal prosecution.  Congress should also carefully investigate the role that other high-ranking Dutch officials have taken to further the cover-up which has allowed Demmink to remain free.  Just as Penn State had to tear down the wall of silence that allowed some authorities to look the other way while Jerry Sandusky violated young boys, Dutch authorities must do the same in the Netherlands.  The institutionalized and systemic protection of this accused pedophile must end.  It is time to arrest Joris Demmink.”<br>
<br>
<br>
 Joris Demmink<br>
A criminal investigation into rape charges against a top civil servant has failed to turn up any evidence him and <br>
the case has now<br>
 been dropped. The decision brings to an end 10 years of legal wrangling about whether Joris Demmink, former director general of the justice ministry, raped two boys in Turkey in the late 1990s. <br>
Demmink (69) was accused of raping the boys, aged 12 and 14, in 2007 by a Turkish national. The case was picked<br>
 up by his lawyer Adèle van der Plas, on behalf of one of the boys in 2010. The other refused to press charges. -Advertentie- An initial investigation by the public prosecution department failed to turn up any evidence<br>
 and in 2015, the appeal court ordered a formal criminal investigation. The results of that three year probe are, the public prosecution says, conclusive. ‘I am convinced that the crimes so as described in the complaints never happened,’ justice ministry official Ronald Steen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Paperwork :The investigators combed all Demmink’s papers, bank statements, travel documents, minutes of meetings and concert visits which took place in the period the rapes were said to have happened but failed to find any evidence he was in Turkey. The documents were also checked thoroughly to find out if they had been forged, officials told the Volkskrant. Turkey refused to cooperate with the investigation but a Turkish document purporting<br>
 to show he was in Turkey is a fake, the investigators say. Relieved Demmink’s lawyer Jan Leliveld told the Volkskrant that his client is relieved about the ‘crystal clear’ decision of the court. ‘But he regrets all the accusations that have given shape to his life over the past 10 years, Leliveld said. Demmink’s name has also cropped up in a secret investigation known as the Rolodex inquiry into child prostitution rings in the Netherlands in the 1980s. In December 2014, Demmink lost his claim against the AD newspaper which published an article about his alleged contacts with a child pimp. The AD reported on the alleged contacts in October 2012, based on three different eye witnesses. The paper also quoted another source as saying boys had been picked up in Demmink’s car.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
During the October 4 U.S. Helsinki Commission Briefing – “Listening to Victims of Child Sex Trafficking” – Chairman and Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ), in reference to the accusations against Secretary-General Joris Demmink, stated, “It is imperative that the justice system be ready to listen to allegations and to thoroughly investigate allegations no matter when they are raised – and no matter who is accused.”  According to a report on the briefing in the Catholic News Report, accusations of Demmink sexually abusing young boys in Turkey remain uninvestigated.  The report stated: “The boys’ lawyer, Adele van der Plas, said that the criminal charges filed on behalf of these boys were never officially investigated, despite the availability of primary witnesses. One of the accusers has reportedly faced threats and abuse for coming forward with his story. Rather than investigate the matter, she said, the government accepted Demmink’s claim that he was not in Turkey in the 1990s. While Turkish sources have evidence to suggest that this is not accurate, she said, ‘there is considerable pressure exerted on the Turks by the Dutch not to reveal the truth.‘”  According to van der Plas’ testimony before the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Dutch authorities also deterred criminal investigations into pedophile networks of influential Dutch customers at boy brothels.<br>
