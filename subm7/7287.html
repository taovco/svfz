sorry Im not bilingual.............<br>
<br>
<br>
It turns out the cereal company is throwing millions to Soros, the Clintons, La Raza and Black Lives Matter.<br>
<br>
From Breitbart<br>
<br>
A new report reveals the shocking amount of money donated by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to left-wing, pro-socialist orgs in coordination with the Clintons and anti-American billionaire George Soros.<br>
<br>
The extensive report by Capital Research shows a long history of leftism by the foundation created by the man who founded the Michigan-based breakfast giant, Kellogg’s. It also chronicles how far the foundation has drifted from <br>
its founder’s wishes.<br>
<br>
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation is one of the largest, left-wing donors in the country, according to the report:<br>
<br>
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation is currently the seventh-largest philanthropy in the U.S. in terms of dollars.  In 2015, <br>
 the foundation distributed nearly 2,000 grants totaling $268,065,253.<br>
<br>
The Kellogg Foundation was originally founded to provide health care, healthy foods, and services for children <br>
in rural areas of the country. Its ultimate goal was to help Americans achieve self-reliance. But since the 1950s, the foundation began seriously straying from those ideals and edging toward funding anti-American socialist policies, ideals, and organizations.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the report points out that Martin Morse Wooster wrote that Kellogg himself complained about the “Socialist trend” in politics and “could not possibly have foreseen the way his org would be used after his death to combat ‘white privilege,’ or assist groups like ‘La Raza.’”<br>
<br>
Sadly, W.K. Kellogg — who died in 1951 — did not lay out a concerted plan for his foundation to follow.<br>
<br>
“The direction he gave to guide future trustees,” Wooster wrote, “was to ‘use the money as you please so long as it promotes the health, happiness, and well-being of children.’”<br>
<br>
As CR’s Michael Volpe writes on the foundation:<br>
<br>
It supports trendy, left-wing causes that contend America is a hopelessly racist country, along with groups that wage war on the free markets that the great capitalist Kellogg championed while alive. Kellogg would naturally approve of the foundation’s modern-day funding of hospitals, community centers, and children’s welfare organizations.<br>
 But he never used his foundation to promote his politics which were apparently right of center for his times.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The foundation has, donated millions to the Mexican nationalist organization, La Raza — the group founded to “reclaim” the southwestern United States for Mexico. In 2015, the foundation gave $2,400,000 to the National Council of La Raza for “general operating support.”<br>
<br>
Some of the money given to various La Raza and similar outfits are:<br>
<br>
    $125,000 to El Centro De Igualdad y Derechos (The Center for Equality and Rights) in Albuquerque<br>
    $400,000 to La Plaza De Encuentro (The Meeting Place) in Albuquerque<br>
    $25,000 for the Latin American Youth Center in Washington, DC<br>
    $204,000 National Hispanic Media Coalition<br>
<br>
The Kellogg Foundation also has deep ties and associations with George Soros and the Clintons. Breitbart News<br>
 noted that Kellogg gave $200,000 to George Soros’s far left Open Society Institute.<br>
<br>
Kellogg also gave $930,000 to Black Lives Matter and millions to the Clintons and Soros.<br>
 <br>

A Foundation for the Future<br>
<br>
More than 100 years ago, W.K. Kellogg founded our company through his belief in nutrition and dedication to well-being.<br>
<br>
Motivated by a passion for people, quality and innovation, he created the first-ever breakfast cereal and then<br>
 shaped an entire industry. Kellogg soon became a household name.<br>
<br>
Today, W.K. Kellogg’s legacy continues to inspire us. Working together, we create moments of delight for people around the world with our well-loved brands.<br>
<br>
 Through our values-based culture, we create a stronger future every day — enriching communities and nurturing careers by putting people first in everything we do.<br>
<br>
And it all started simply with a single corn flake and W.K. Kellogg’s belief in better food for all.<br>
<br>
Kellogg Company is committed to establishing and growing relationships with small and diverse businesses. These small and diverse businesses include 8(a), Aboriginal, Black, Disability, LGBT+, Minority, Woman, Service Disabled &amp; Veteran, and Woman Owned.<br>

The Kellogg Company, doing business as Kellogg's, is an American multinational food manufacturing company headquartered in Battle Creek, Michigan. Kellogg's produces cereal and convenience foods, including crackers and toaster pastries and markets their products by several well known brands including Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Pringles, Eggo, and Cheez-It. Kellogg's mission statement is "Nourishing families so they can flourish and thrive.<br>
Kellogg's products are manufactured and marketed in over 180 countries.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1876, John Harvey Kellogg became the superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium (originally the Western Health Reform Institute founded by Ellen White) and his brother, W. K. Kellogg, worked as the bookkeeper. This is where corn flakes were accidentally created and led to the eventual formation of the Kellogg Company.<br>
For years, W. K. Kellogg assisted his brother in research aimed at improving the vegetarian diet of the Battle Creek Sanitarium's patients, especially in the search for wheat-based granola. In 1894 at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, a combination hospital and health spa for the elite and famous, W.K. Kellogg and his brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg were in the process of cooking some wheat for a type of granola when they were called away. When they returned, the wheat had become stale. They decided to force the tempered grain through the rollers anyway, and surprisingly, the grain did not come out in long sheets of dough. Instead, each wheat berry was flattened and came out as a thin flake.<br>
W. K. Kellogg persuaded his brother to serve the food in flake form. Soon the flaked wheat was being packaged to meet hundreds of mail-order requests from guests after they left the Sanitarium. However, Dr. John Harvey forbade his brother Will from distributing cereal beyond his consumers. As a result, the brothers fell out, and W. K. launched the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company on February 19, 1906. Convincing his brother to relinquish rights to the product, Will's company produced and marketed the hugely successful Kellogg's Toasted Corn Flakes and was renamed the Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company in 1909, taking on the current name of the Kellogg Company.<br>
In 1931, the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30-hour work weeks, from the usual 40. W.K. Kellogg stated that he did this so that an additional shift of workers would be employed in an effort to support people through the depression era. This practice remained until World War II, and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour work weeks until 1980.<br>
 Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers age 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior. The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, totaled $5.4 billion by 1988 and had expanded three times as fast as the average grocery category. Kellogg's also introduced new products including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits. During this time, the company maintained success over its top competitors: General Mills, which largely marketed children's cereals, and Post.<br>
In 2001, Kellogg's acquired the Keebler Company for $3.87 billion. Over the years, it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. Kellogg's also owns the Bear Naked, Natural Touch, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin cookies and crackers, Famous Amos, Gardenburger (acquired 2007), and Plantation brands. Presently, Kellogg's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation.<br>
In 2012, Kellogg's became the world's second-largest snack food company (after PepsiCo) by acquiring the potato crisps brand Pringles.<br>
In 2017, Kellogg's acquired Chicago-based food company Roxbar for $654 million.  Kellogg's also opened new corporate office space in Chicago's Merchandise Mart for its global growth and IT departments. In the UK, Kellogg's also released the W. K. Kellogg brand of organic, vegan and plant-based cereals (such as granolas, organic wholegrain wheat, and "super grains") with no added sugars.<br>

Controversies<br>
Questionable nutritional value<br>
Some of Kellogg's marketing has been questioned in the press, prompted by an increase in consumer awareness of the mismatch between the marketing messages and the products themselves.<br>
Food bloggers are also questioning the marketing methods used by cereal manufacturing companies such as Kellogg's, due to their high sugar content and use of ingredients such as high-fructose corn syrup.<br>
<br>
2010 cereal recall<br>
On June 25, the company voluntarily began to recall about 28 million boxes of Apple Jacks, Corn Pops, Froot Loops and Honey Smacks because of an unusual smell and flavor from the packages' liners that could make people ill. Kellogg's said about 20 people complained about the cereals, including five who reported nausea and vomiting. Consumers reported the cereal smelled or tasted waxy or like metal or soap. Company spokeswoman J. Adaire Putnam said some described it as tasting stale. However, no serious health problems had been reported.<br>
The suspected chemical that caused the illnesses was 2-methylnaphthalene, used in the cereal packaging process. Little is known about 2-methylnaphthalene's impact on human health as the Food and Drug Administration has no scientific data on its impact on humans, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also does not have health and safety data. This is despite the EPA having sought information on it from the chemical industry for 16 years. 2-Methylnaphthalene is a component of crude oil and is "structurally related to naphthalene, an ingredient in mothballs and toilet-deodorant blocks" that the EPA considers a possible human carcinogen. <br>
<br>
2012 cereal recall<br>
Kellogg's issued a voluntary recall of some of its "Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size Original" and "Mini-Wheats Unfrosted Bite Size" products due to the possibility of flexible metal mesh fragments in the food. wth</div>
