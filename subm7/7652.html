<em class="text-italics">NY Mayor Eric Adams</em><br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>NEW YORK – New York City Mayor Eric Adams today announced the launch of digital billboards and creative ads denouncing the recent passage of Florida’s “Parental Rights in Education” bill in five Florida cities.<br>
<br>
The bill is known by critics as the ‘Don’t Say Gay Bill.’ The legislation, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, places limits on classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in Grades kindergarten through third.<br>
<br>
“The campaign is a reaffirmation of Mayor Adams’ commitment and unconditional support for the LGBTQ+ community,” Adams’ office said in a news release. “The new legislation bans instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade — a targeted attack on the LGBTQ+ population. New York City’s response is to double down on its commitment to preserving the right to free speech and building a city that welcomes everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. With this new creative campaign, New York City is making a direct call to Floridians who are under attack.”<br>
<br>
“I am the mayor of New York City, but I have a message for Florida’s LGBTQ+ community — come to a city where you can say and be whoever you want,” said Mayor Adams. “Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill is the latest shameful, extremist culture war targeting the LGBTQ+ community. Today, we say to the families living in fear of this state-sponsored discrimination that you will always have a home in New York City.”<br>
<br>
Creative content for the billboards was designed in partnership with WPP companies, VMLY&amp;R, GroupM, BCW, and H+K Strategies. All of the donated ad space was secured by Kinetic, a GroupM company. In total, there will be five unique pieces of creative art that will run across digital billboards and social media.<br>
<br>
“Educators work every day to make New York City public schools safe and supportive environments for LGBTQ+ youth,” said New York City Department of Education Chancellor David C. Banks. “From what we teach, to how we care for young people, we create schools that affirm and lift up the students and honor who they are. Children bring the totality of who they are into our classrooms, and the cruel actions being taken across this country to attack LGBTQ+ children is contrary to everything we believe in as educators.”<br>
<br>
“LGBTQ+ youth deserve the same things that all young people deserve: to be seen, to be heard, and to be respected,” said Kevin Jennings, CEO, Lambda Legal; and founder, Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. “Schools and curriculums that are inclusive of all young people and their families literally save lives. We’re here with a welcoming, loud, and proud message to let LGBTQ+ young people know they are not alone.”<br>
<br>
“New York City stands firmly with LGBTQ+ youth across the country during these difficult times,” said Elisa Crespo, executive director, NEW Pride Agenda. “We are here for you, we see you, and we will always have your back and fight for you.”<br>
<br>
“The New York City Anti-Violence Project stands in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community of Florida,” said Beverly Tillery, executive director, New York City Anti-Violence Project. “Attempting to silence and deny LGBTQ+ people, especially youth, the support they need is violence and can lead to poor mental health outcomes, interruptions in education, and youth homelessness. If you are an LGBTQ+ survivor of violence and need help, you can call or text our 24-hour, bilingual hotline for support and referrals: 212-714-1141.”<br>
<br>
“Mayor Adams is making an excellent statement with these ads — in New York City, everyone is welcome,” said Daniel Dromm, LGBTQ+ activist; former chair, New York City Council Committee on Finance. “As a New York City public school teacher for 25 years, I have news for Florida: Students are already saying gay. They see us on the news and on television shows. They know that LGBTQ+ people are their family, friends, and neighbors. These ads will reaffirm New York City’s commitment to creating an inclusive school environment, in sharp contrast to the discriminatory policies of Governor DeSantis.”<br>
<br>
“Over 40 percent of the 2,000 LGBTQ+ youths Ali Forney Center sees every year come from outside the Empire State, and a majority come to us from the south,” said Alex Roque, executive director, Ali Forney Center (AFC). “New York City has been a beacon of acceptance, hope, and love. AFC applauds the City of New York for supporting proudly, loudly, and visibly efforts to demonstrate for LGBTQ+ youths that they are welcome here to be who they are.”<br>
