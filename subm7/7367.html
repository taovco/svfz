<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Personal testimony, from a woman who was married to a “transgender” man: <br>
<br>
“I have an idea, let's just have a Transgender Story Time at the library. <br>
<br>
“I will start with my story.  It isn't a really happy story but it is a true story.  It includes children being told they can no longer call their father "dad" even in the privacy of their own home, or they face punishment.  It includes children, being coerced to wear pride bracelets to school by a transgender lover of their transgender father.  It includes transgender father and FTM (note: female to male) lover repeatedly telling a 9th-grade boy it is okay to be gay and he can totally tell them if he is. <br>
<br>
“It includes a MTF father and his transgender activist friends trying to put children ages 5, 6 and 11 on the transgender float in the pride parade (which featured a man wearing a bondage outfit, leash and holding a whip).  It includes abuse and threat to murder all of my children and my ex by the FTM (female to male) lover of their father. <br>
<br>
“It includes a FTM transgender that has a criminal history for assault and battery against a woman partner but was still appointed co-chair to the LGBT Advisory Board by Mayor Turner.  It includes children finding sex toys and straps for bondage and S&amp;M on the bed at their dad's house....where they sometimes slept with their dad and his lover on the same bed. <br>
<br>
“It includes how nobody who knew this was happening in the family courts, court-appointed counselor and psychiatrist and CPS did not take action to protect these children until a lawsuit was underway putting the microscope on them.  It would include boys who cried themselves to sleep for YEARS! It would include a boy dropping out of boy scouts because he did not have a father to participate with after the cross-over ceremony because his dad was crossing over to the opposite sex. <br>
<br>
“It would include the harassment I had to endure at the hands of activists [sic] lawyers bombarding me with motions and complaints and running up legal bills on a single mom while activists paid the bills of the transgender client so that the kids could be taken into custody by him for a victory on their side, despite the fact they were primarily cared for all the time by me, the mother. <br>
<br>
“It would include suicidal ideation experienced by my boys and manifestations of OCD including trichotillomania (pulling out of hair, eyelashes, eyebrows) in one child and also forced regurgitation by one child because the child wanted to feel calm and in control.  It would include a father who wanted to breastfeed his own baby. It would include a counselor who is active in the LGBT community calling me close-minded when I wanted to save my marriage and stop the cross-dressing I had found out about.  It would include that that counselor said I must be a lesbian. <br>
<br>
“It would include the deep pain that a wife suffered as a result of losing a husband and breaking up her family over what is a lie - a man becoming a woman.  It would include the ways the cross-dressing tormented her and affected her own expression of femininity for years.  It would include how the narcissist survival techniques of a man who is living a lie and pursuing an even bigger one affects the mind and spirit of a wife. <br>
<br>
“It would include how doctors lie on medical records because of feelings.  It would include how counselors ignore previous mental health diagnosis and pursued the wishes of their patient even without his wife being informed of the impending sex-change.  It would include a husband concealing the taking of sex-change hormones for over 11 years possibly contributing to a miscarriage and related cancer. <br>
<br>
“It would include being told I cannot co-parent with a transgender parent because I am a Christian.  It would include a lawyer trying to force me by the power of the courts to use preferred pronouns when referring to my husband of 15 years and father of 3 of my children.  I don't know what to dress up as and what songs and crafts to include in this story time, but it would be an honest story time.</div></blockquote> <a href="https://www.afa.net/the-stand/culture/2018/12/how-about-transgender-story-time-from-a-victim/" class="postlink">https://www.afa.net/the-stand/culture/2 ... -a-victim/</a></div>
