This is the (((opposition))) that (((they))) have selected for White Europeans who are desperate to reclaim their homeland.</strong>   <br><br><br><img src="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprodmigration%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F9e6125a2-f237-3075-ad09-9fbf7bf3449a.jpg?crop=780%2C520%2C0%2C0&amp;resize=1180" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><em class="text-italics">Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine who is running for president</em><br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Jean-Marie Le Pen was born on 20 June 1928 in La Trinité-sur-Mer, a small seaside village in Brittany, the son of Anne Marie Hervé and Jean Le Pen, a fisherman. He was orphaned at 14. For someone who has never excelled academically he was surprisingly accepted in the Jesuit school Collège-Lycée-Prépa Saint-François-Xavier de Vannes which is a preparatory school.<br><br>
How many poor Catholic fishermans sons with no academic talent get into quality Jesuit preparatory schools?<br><br>
The Jesuit movement was started by Crypto Jews and has always been associated with crypto Judiasm.<br><br>
From there Jean Marie entered the faculty of law in Paris. He became president of the Association corporative des étudiants en droit, an association of law students whose main occupation was to engage in street brawls against the “Cocos” (communists). He was excluded from this organisation in 1951. He took to wearing an eyepatch in the 60s falsely claiming to have lost his eyesight during a political brawl.<br><br>
After receiving his law diploma, he enlisted in the army in the Foreign Legion. In Paris in 1956, he was elected to the National Assembly as a member of Pierre Poujade‘s UDCA populist party. Le Pen, 28 years old, was the youngest member of the Assembly.<br><br><img src="https://resize-parismatch.lanmedia.fr/r/901,,forcex/img/var/news/storage/images/paris-match/actu/politique/l-album-de-jeunesse-de-marine-le-pen-1248167/mlp-jeune-1/20982890-1-fre-FR/Mlp-jeune-1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br>
In 1960 he married Pierrette Lalanne with whom he had three daughters, Marie-Caroline, Yann and Marine. These daughters have given him nine granddaughters.<br><br>
For someone supposedly so antisemitic, women in Le Pens life have had close ties with Jews<br><br>
Le Pen’s marriage break up was somewhat dramatic, with his 49 year old ex-wife of 25 years posing nude in the French edition of crypto Jew Hugh Hefner Playboy to “ridicule” him. Equally strangely for such a raging Antisemite Le Pen never uttered a word against the porn industry of Jew Hefner.<br><br><img src="https://www.planet.fr/files/styles/diapo_aspect_switcher/public/images/diaporama/3/5/7/138753/1164590-inline.jpg?itok=XzshkThx" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><em class="text-italics">This is the least slutty image I could find on the subject</em><br><br><br>
His political life got better though. Ordre Nouveau (New Order in French) was a far-right movement created on December 15, 1969. The first president was the lawyer Jean-François Galvaire (who worked for Roland Gaucher, a former member of the National Popular Rally). In June 1972, Ordre Nouveau joined with Jean-Marie Le Pen’s movement in the Front National. José Bruneau de La Salle joined the political bureau, while Jean-Claude Nourry, Patrice Janeau and Michel Bodin left the movement.<br><br><br><br><strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">On October 5, 1972 the Front National was formed.</span></strong><br><br>
M Le Pen first ran for president in 1974, winning less than one per cent of the vote in the first round. In 1976 Hubert Lambert - just 42 yers old, heir to a large cement fortune and a generous donor to extreme Right-wing causes died. Lambert changed his will months before his death to make M Le Pen his sole heir. Members of M Lambert’s family challenged the new will but M Le Pen held on to his inheritance, valued at the time at £4 million (probably worth 20 million $ today).There were rumurs that the Lambert family split some much larger unaccounted accounts in Hubert Lamberts name with Le Pen and settled the matter.<br><br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E28APyQXMAAWixC.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br>
Hubert Lambert does look Jewish. There is a famous Jewish banking Lambert dynasty who started out as agents of the Rothschilds. Hubert Lambert may be linked to these Lamberts. Lamberts money meant that Le Pen could concentrate full time into politics. G–D sent stroke of luck like his Jesuit schooling.<br><br>
Jean Marie Le Pen has repeatedly been accused of making antisemitic remarks. Yet the most “antisemitic” thing Jean Marie has said is this “I ask myself several questions. I’m not saying the gas chambers didn’t exist. I haven’t seen them myself. I haven’t particularly studied the question. But I believe it’s just a detail in the history of World War II.” He was condemned under the Gayssot Act to pay 1.2 million francs (183,200 euros).<br><br>
Under Jean-Marie, the FN also transformed into a family business, at one point involving all of his three daughters. Today, only Marine, Yann (Jean-Marie’s second daughter), and the latter’s 25-year-old daughter Marion (also one of the FN’s two members of parliament), are still closely involved in the party organization.<br><br><img src="https://images.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2015/04/13/french-far-right-leader-jean-marie-le-pen-steps-back-to-ease-family-feud/le-pen.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><em class="text-italics">A family business</em><br><br><br><br><br>
Marine was married in 1995 to Franck Chauffroy, a business executive who worked for the National Front. By Chauffroy, she has three children (Jehanne, Louis, and Mathilde). After her divorce from Chauffroy in 2000, she married Eric Lorio in 2002, the former national secretary of the National Front and a former adviser to the Regional election in Nord-Pas de Calais, whom she also divorced in 2006.<br><br><br>
Since 2009, she has been in a relationship with Louis Aliot, whose grandfather was Algerian Jewish. In 2010 she took over the Front National from daddy Jean Marie Cohencidence<br><br><img src="https://fac.img.pmdstatic.net/fit/http.3A.2F.2Fprd2-bone-image.2Es3-website-eu-west-1.2Eamazonaws.2Ecom.2FFAC.2F2019.2F09.2F20.2Fe2eb243e-bd42-48b5-82e5-709755f1cf83.2Ejpeg/900x600/quality/65/marine-le-pen-et-louis-aliot.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><em class="text-italics">Marine le Pen and Louis Aliot</em><br><br><img src="https://counter-currents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LePenJews2.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><em class="text-italics">Louis Aliot virtue signaling at an old roman ruin</em><br><br><img src="https://www.parti-de-la-france.fr/wp-content/uploads/ex2/L-un-des-policiers-en-charge-de-l-affaire-Ulcan-est-un-militant-sioniste-proche-de-Marine-Le-Pen_a198-480x320.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><em class="text-italics">Michel Thooris</em><br><br><br>
Michel Thooris who has a Jewish mother is part of the FN’s Central Committee. Thooris is also the founder of Union des Patriotes Francais Juifs, or the Union of French-Jewish Patriots. Aliot, accompanied Thooris on a visit to Israel in 2011. Thooris acknowledges the informal but intriguing ties between his fledgling movement and the FN.<br><br>
Roger Cukierman, head of CRIF, the country’s umbrella organization for Jewish institutions.  announced that Marine Le Pen, unlike her father, was “personally irreproachable” — a remark he quickly walked back in the resulting firestorm of criticism.<br><br>
But the Le Pen’s Jewish ties just got way stronger in 2013<br><br><br><strong class="text-strong">Marion Jeanne Caroline Maréchal-Le Pen</strong> (b 1989) is the , granddaughter of Front national (FN) founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, and niece of current FN president Marine Le Pen.Her mother Yann Le Pen,is  Jean-Marie Le Pen’s second daughter<br><br><img src="https://img-4.linternaute.com/HtShmt5JK1cl15FX9eZ6JkQ1RDQ=/1240x/smart/image-cms/2573291.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><em class="text-italics">Marion Marchal Le Pen and her biological Mossad Daddy  Roger Auque</em><br><br><br><strong class="text-strong">On 7 November 2013, the French weekly news magazine L’Express disclosed the identity of her birth father, Roger Auque, a Mossad agent and investigative journalist who died in September 2014.
