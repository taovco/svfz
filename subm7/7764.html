<br>
I wrote about this idea of a sacrificial dove here: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=7575" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=7575</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Javid's eldest brother Tariq died in <span style="color:#FF0040">July 2018</span> in "an unnatural death"; a full inquest was held, in which the coroner ruled Tariq had intentionally killed himself after drinking alcohol and taking codeine at the luxury South Lodge Hotel, which was near his home in Horsham. In a letter left to Sylvia — his partner of 15 years — Tariq suggested that, due to ill health, he would not "last long". Tariq was a successful businessman and managed a supermarket chain
</div></blockquote>

Also in 2018:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>At the Conservative Friends of Israel Conference of 2018, Javid explained how a school trip to Israel by his brother forty years ago set off his lifelong support for Israel and added, "my dad explained the history, how it came about and why it is such a special place. Since then I always wanted to visit." Javid visited when he and his wife spent their honeymoon there... Javid's appointment as Home Secretary was welcomed by a number of Jewish organisations, including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council.. In 2015, addressing the <span style="color:#FF0040">Holocaust Educational Trust's</span> annual dinner, the then Business Secretary Javid condemned "dinner party anti-Semites" and said, "I can't remember the last time I spoke to a Jewish friend or colleague who hasn't, at some point, found themselves sitting awkwardly at a dinner party while a fellow guest railed against the international 'kosher conspiracy'"<br>
<br>
In 2018, Javid suggested Jeremy Corbyn should quit as Labour leader following his decision to attend a 2014 wreath-laying at a cemetery which contained the graves of many Palestinian activists; including Salah Khalaf and Atef Bseiso, members of the Black September Organization.<br>
<br>
In March 2018, Javid called Momentum "neo-fascist" in the House of Commons chamber. Momentum threatened legal action if he repeated the comment outside Parliament <br>
<br>
April 30, 2018 - Jewish News "Community ally Sajid Javid replaces Amber Rudd as Home Secretary" <a href="https://www.jewishnews.co.uk/community-ally-sajid-javid-replaces-amber-rudd-as-home-secretary/" class="postlink">https://www.jewishnews.co.uk/community- ... secretary/</a><br>
<br>
In June 2018, a polling of Tory activists on ConservativeHome showed Javid was popular as a potential party leader. The poll is seen as a reliable barometer of grassroots opinion, although it is known to shift quickly.[51] A separate poll of Conservative Party members by <span style="color:#FF0040">YouGov</span> in July 2018 also showed he had high levels of support to become party leader.</div></blockquote>

In November 2017, "Bromsgrove MP Sajid Javid wins Patchwork Foundation's Conservative MP of the Year Award" <a href="https://www.bromsgroveadvertiser.co.uk/news/15665214.bromsgrove-mp-sajid-javid-wins-patchwork-foundations-conservative-mp-of-the-year-award/" class="postlink">https://www.bromsgroveadvertiser.co.uk/ ... ear-award/</a><br>

Lord Rumi Verjee's mansion was the setting for the deadly shooting <br>
<br>
EXCLUSIVE: Cops killed a man on-the-run at former Domino's Pizza tycoon Lord Rumi Verjee's villa in Rio de Janeiro<br>
<br>
Police shot dead a guest during a rowdy wedding party at a mansion owned by a Lib-Dem peer.<br>
<br>
Pizza tycoon Lord Rumi Verjee’s villa in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, became a crime scene after undercover officers felled on-the-run Michel Matias, 37, with four shots.<br>
<br>
Lord Verjee – who brought Domino’s Pizza to the UK in the 1980s and who owns Thomas Goode which sup­­plies glass and china to the Royals – was not believed to be in Rio at the time. He had sub-let the mansion to a French­­man and neighbours insisted he had no idea it had been used for a noisy 1,000-strong samba bash on Sunday.<br>
<br>
A spokesman said Uganda-born Lord Verjee, 61, had been “unaware of the issues” and had ended the tenancy.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/gcu82w.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

The peer, who owned Watford FC alongside Elton John in the 1990s, is believed to be worth £160million. In 2014 the Lib-Dem donor was in a £1.1million cash-for- honours row after being made a Lord.<br>
<br>
As well as bringing Domino’s to the UK in 1985 before selling his stake in 1989, he has a property empire in Brazil.</div></blockquote>

How unlucky.</div>
