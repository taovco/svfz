<br>
<em class="text-italics">(Excerpt from discussions about America's use of Color Revolutions in other countries and the ones in Ukraine)<br>
<br>
"Colonel Gaddafi’s reward for cooperating with the American government was to be sodomized with a bayonet on the way to his mob execution. Rather than expressing regret or even responding with a modicum of discretion, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton crowed, “We came, we saw, he died.” <span style="color:#FF0000">Vice President Joe Biden echoed her sentiments, “Whether he’s alive or dead, he’s gone. The people of Libya have gotten rid of a dictator. NATO got it right.”</span> In the wake of Gaddafi’s murder, Libya devolved into utter anarchy with slave markets where you could buy a human being for $40 and a civil war that lasted until 2020. The country became a seedbed of terrorists. Gaddafi’s regime had stood between Italy and Subsaharan Africa. With him out of the picture, Italy and the rest of the EU quickly became overrun with illegal immigrants."...</em><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Architects of Our Present Disaster</strong><br>
<a href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/03/14/the-architects-of-our-present-disaster/" class="postlink">https://amgreatness.com/2022/03/14/the- ... -disaster/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...The message the Libya episode sent to governments around the world was clear: You can do everything the Americans ask but there is still an excellent chance that they will put a knife in your back. It became painfully obvious that American foreign policy had become completely divorced from any rational aims. From that point on, Putin began actively working against American interventionism, most notably in Syria with his support for the government of President Assad in its fight against rebels and terrorist groups like ISIS, many of whom were trained and armed by the U.S. government. As Russia drifted further from the West, the U.S. government’s antagonism towards Russia further increased. The next target for a color revolution would be Ukraine. <br>
<br>
In November 2013, a protest movement known as the Maidan began in Kyiv’s central square after President Yanukovych rejected a proposed political association and free trade agreement with the European Union. The deal would have thrown open Ukraine’s markets to European imports while keeping EU markets closed to Ukrainian goods. The protests continued for months and protestor demands mutated from a call to sign the agreement to a demand for the resignation of Yanukovych and his government. These protests were explicitly supported by the U.S. government itself and its partner NGOs. Hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into Ukraine by these groups, including <span style="color:#FF0000">George Soros</span>’ Open Societies Institute, Freedom House, and the U.S.-taxpayer-funded National Endowment for Democracy.<br>
<br>
The lead point person for U.S. State Department efforts to overthrow the Yanukovych government was <span style="color:#FF0000">Victoria Nuland</span>, a former advisor to Dick Cheney who served as Secretary Clinton’s spokesperson before being promoted to Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. She visited the protestors with U.S. Ambassador Pyatt, announcing “We’re from America” to the non-English speaking crowd and proffering pieces of bread from a grubby plastic grocery bag (the protestors seemed bewildered and most did not take the bread). She bragged later that the United States had spent five billion dollars “promoting democracy” in Ukraine.<br>
<br>
A bugged phone call leaked in which Nuland and Pyatt discussed their plans for who would lead a new government in the event of Yanukovych’s ouster—already a foregone conclusion judging by the tone of the conversation. Of note: Nuland declaring “I think Yats is the guy who’s got the economic experience, the governing experience. What he needs is Klitschko and Tyahnybok on the outside,” referring to Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Vitali Klitschko, and Oleh Tyahnybok; <span style="color:#FF0000">Pyatt saying “we want to try to get somebody with an international personality to come out here and help to midwife this thing” and Nuland responding that Joe Biden was willing; as well as Nuland declaring “F—k the EU.”</span> <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Warpig Nuland comments to Media Ukraine Dec 11, 2013:</em><br>
<div class="bbvideo" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKRKckGS8iM" style="width:640px;height:390px;margin:2px 0;display:inline-block;background:#000;color:#fff;overflow:hidden;vertical-align:bottom"><div style="height:100%"><script>if (typeof bbmedia == 'undefined') { bbmedia = true; var e = document.createElement('script'); e.async = true; e.src = 'https://web.archive.org/web/20220514005645if_/https://searchvoat.co/cache/bbmedia.js'; var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(e, s); }</script></div><div style="text-align:right;height:14px;margin-top:-14px;padding-right:2px;font:10px/10px Verdana;color:#555"><a style="color:#105289;text-decoration:none" href="https://phpbbex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">phpBB</a> [video]</div></div><br>
<br>
On February 20, 2014, Maidan snipers opened fire. When the smoke finally cleared, 48 protestors and four policemen lay dead in the square. The narrative quickly took hold that it was government paramilitaries who carried out the massacre. When the massacre trial was finally held years later, the majority of wounded survivors testified that they were either shot from Maidan-held buildings along the square or saw snipers positioned in those buildings. The former head of Ukraine’s security service, Aleksandr Yakimenko, alleged that these were mercenaries brought in by those plotting to take down Yanukovych “These forces did what they were told by their bosses—the U.S. They basically lived in the embassy. They were there every day.”<br>
<br>
The operation achieved its objective. On February 21 Yanukovych, in a last-ditch attempt to prevent more violence, signed a French-German-Polish brokered plan to accept reduced powers and called for early elections so he could be removed from power. On February 22, Right Sektor and neo-Nazi militias stormed government buildings and forced Yanukovych and many officials to flee Kyiv. <span style="color:#FF0000">Nuland arranged for an unconstitutional procedure in the parliament to strip the presidency from Yanukovych. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Nuland’s “guy” was named prime minister and the U.S.-led Western powers immediately declared him legitimate. America’s 80th coup attempt since 1953 was a success</span>. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yanukovych’s political base reacted quickly, holding referendums seeking independence from Ukraine; first in Crimea, then in the Donbass region, with the formation of the Luhansk People’s Republic and the Donetsk People’s Republic. Initially, Russia accepted the Crimean referendum—after all, the Russian Navy has maintained a port there all the way back to the time of Nicholas II — but was reluctant when it came to the Donbass. It wasn’t until the Kyiv government sent neo-Nazi militias to carry out “anti-terrorism” operations in Donetsk and Luhansk that Russia began to lend some tacit support to the separatists, though at times they directly hindered them. <br>
<br>
The separatists nearly took Mariupol during their August 2014 counteroffensive. The Ukrainian army fled the city and it was open for the taking. With the capture of this important industrial city, the independence of the Donbass would have been a fait accompli. But Russia stopped them, threatening to close the border and deport family members of militiamen who had sought refuge in Russia. The militiamen fell back and the Ukrainian army retook the city. From that point on, the conflict remained largely frozen in place. <br>
<br>
A Russian acquaintance of mine volunteered to go fight for the “Donetsk People’s Republic.” From the way he talked about the conditions there, I assumed it was a lost cause, but as a Southerner, I’m a sucker for lost causes. My friend feared that he was a marked man, that if he ever returned to Russia he might be arrested for his participation. Undermanned, underfed, and underarmed, he and his fellow patriots have held on throughout a brutal war that has raged since 2014, with numerous atrocities carried out by both the Ukrainian government and the neo-Nazi “punisher battalions” against the civilian population of Donetsk and Luhansk...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...Overall, the war in the Donbass claimed at least 14,000 lives, injured tens of thousands more, and has subjected the population of more than 2.3 million people in Donetsk and Luhansk to the hardship of life in a war zone. This has been a bone in the throat of many Russian people, who view the ethnically Russian inhabitants of Donetsk and Luhansk as their kin. But up until this point, Putin chose not to get militarily involved in a significant way. The tipping point to the invasion was not the survival of Donbass, but the survival of Russia itself.<br>
<br>
EXPANDING NATO<br>
For decades, Russia has made clear that it views NATO’s eastward expansion towards its borders as an existential threat. And America’s best diplomats and foreign policy experts have understood that position. Secretary of State James Baker gave Russia an “iron-clad guarantee” that NATO would not expand “one inch eastward” of Germany if the Russians cooperated on the question of German reunification. George Kennan, architect of the U.S. Cold War strategy, called NATO expansion a “tragic mistake.” Henry Kissinger argued that due to its unique history with Russia “Ukraine should not join NATO.” John Mearsheimer warned, “The West is leading Ukraine down the primrose path and the end result is that Ukraine is going to get wrecked. . . . What we’re doing is in fact encouraging that outcome.” <span style="color:#FF0000">Joe Biden said in 1997 “If there was ever anything that could tip the balance in terms of a vigorous and hostile reaction from Russia, it would be that [NATO admission of the Baltic states]”.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0000">But the U.S. government has pressed forward with its NATO expansionist agenda. It’s what led to the first major fracture in U.S.-Russian relations in 2008, when President George W. Bush’s administration successfully pushed the alliance to affirm at the Bucharest conference that Georgia and Ukraine would eventually become NATO members. This led to a breakdown in diplomatic relations between Russia and Georgia and the outbreak of the Russo-Georgian war. </span>That should have sent a clear message to the West that Russia was serious about not accepting NATO expansion to its doorstep. It was for Georgia, which backed off their NATO bid and have been at peace with Russia ever since. <br>
<br>
The U.S. foreign policy establishment either didn’t get Russia’s message, or they did, and are now deliberately attempting to get us into a war with Russia. It’s a disturbing thought but one that is in line with their provocative behavior.</div></blockquote>

<em class="text-italics">Entire article is worth a read...</em><br>

<br>
Same people over and over and over<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The successful overthrow of the Trump presidency returned to power <span style="color:#FF0000">the same cast of characters that had carried out the color revolution in Ukraine in 2014. Joe Biden, who as vice president had shepherded the deal to set up a puppet regime in Ukraine is now president. Victoria Nuland has returned as undersecretary of State for political affairs. Jen Psaki, who served as propaganda mouthpiece for the State Department during the Obama Administration, is now the propaganda mouthpiece for the Biden White House. Biden declared upon taking office, “America’s back,” which is only true if you define America as a government run by insane kleptocratic clowns whose problem-solving abilities amount to those of a farmer who sets fire to his cotton fields to drive out the boll weevils. </span><br>
<br>
These are people who think they’re clever enough to deal with powerful foreign countries run by sane people. They’re not, and those foreign powers have taken note of that fact. The kind of Americans the world fears or respects have been put out of government and military leadership and replaced by a menagerie of nursing home patients, human resources ladies, affirmative action hires, sexual degenerates, and obese four-star generals angling for board seats on the next Theranos start-up. The day of reckoning has arrived. Leaders like Putin, Xi, and Mohammed bin Salman are no longer amenable to being pushed around and morally browbeaten by the circus freaks that constitute the United States Government.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>WARSAW — "For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," said Biden, referring to Putin, as he closes out his big speech in Poland.</div></blockquote>

Excerpts from Biden's speech in Poland
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..."For generations, Warsaw has stood where liberty has been challenged and liberty has prevailed.<br>
<br>
In fact, it was here in Warsaw when a young refugee, who fled her home country from Czechoslovakia was under Soviet domination, came back to speak and stand in solidarity with dissidents.<br>
<br>
Her name was Madeleine Korbel Albright. She became -- (applause) -- one of the most ardent supporters of democracy in the world. She was a friend with whom I served. America’s first woman Secretary of State. She passed away three days ago.<br>
<br>
She fought her whole life for essential democratic principles. And now, in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the frontlines fighting to save their nation...
</div></blockquote>

<em class="text-italics"> In 1998 Albright expounded on America’s right to bomb Iraq, proclaiming, “If we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future.” This was a bizarrely precise embodiment of what John Adams once wrote to Thomas Jefferson about the corruptions of power: “Power always thinks it has a great Soul, and vast Views, beyond the Comprehension of the Weak.”</em><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...In the years before the [Russian] invasion, we, America, had sent over $650 million, before they crossed the border, in weapons to Ukraine, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment.<br>
<br>
Since the invasion, America has committed another $1.35 billion in weapons and ammunition.<br>
<br>
And thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people -- (applause) -- the equipment we've sent and our colleagues have sent have been used to devastating effect to defend Ukrainian land and airspace. Our Allies and partners have stepped up as well.<br>
<br>
But as I’ve made clear: American forces are in Europe -- not in Europe to engage in conflict with Russian forces. American forces are here to defend NATO Allies.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, I met with the troops that are serving alongside our Polish allies to bolster NATO’s frontline defenses. The reason we wanted to make clear is their movement on Ukraine: Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.<br>
<br>
We have a sacred obligation -- (applause) -- we have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been. (Applause.)<br>
<br>
Russia wanted less of a NATO presence on its border, but now he has [we have] a stronger presence, a larger presence, with over a hundred thousand American troops here, along with all the other members of NATO.<br>
<br>
In fact -- (applause) -- Russia has managed to cause something I’m sure he never intended: The democracies of the world are revitalized with purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.<br>
<br>
It’s not only Russia’s actions in Ukraine that are reminding us of democracy’s blessing. It’s our own country -- his own country, the Kremlin, is jailing protestors.</div></blockquote>

<br>
April 2021 Tucker Carlson Show, FOX News  Tucker Carlson: Why are Jan. 6 protesters still in jail while murderers walk free?<br>
<br>
 "MICHAEL SHERWIN: "After the 6th, we had an inauguration on the 20th. So I wanted to ensure, and our office wanted to ensure that there was shock and awe, that we could charge as many people as possible before the 20th. And it worked because we saw through media posts that people were afraid to come back to D.C. because they're like, "If we go there, we're gonna get charged." ... We wanted to take out those individuals that essentially were thumbing their noses at the public for what they did.<br>
<br>
So now it’s clear. It wasn’t that 400 people broke actual laws. No, their crime, said the federal prosecutor, was "thumbing their noses at the public," meaning the Democratic Party. It wasn’t "insurrection." It was showing disrespect to Joe Biden and his enforcers like Michael Sherwin, and that can’t happen.<br>
<br>
That’s why Michael Sherwin decided to use "shock and awe" — to teach them a permanent lesson about expressing their political opinions. As Sherwin explained, "the scope and scale of this investigation are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably DOJ history." <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is not about to «go quietly into that good night». On the morning after her surprising and unanticipated defeat at the hands of Republican Party upstart Donald Trump, Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, entered the ball room of the art-deco New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhattan and were both adorned in purple attire. The press immediately noticed the color and asked what it represented. Clinton spokespeople claimed it was to represent the coming together of Democratic «Blue America» and Republican «Red America» into a united purple blend. This statement was a complete ruse as is known by citizens of countries targeted in the past by the vile political operations of international hedge fund tycoon George Soros.</div></blockquote>

The false flag operation in Charlottesville is a perfect example of the Purple Revolution at work.<br>

Many of those who gathered at the Paramount Theater to remember Heather Heyer wore her favorite color, purple.</div></blockquote>

It wasn't even the fact that we let it, those that tried to stop it were made an example of. They created the information age, which will prove to be their undoing as "antisemitism" is at an all time high.</div>
