<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/o46zv1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

a blue shield with a gold trident. Officially referred to as the Princely State Symbol of Volodymyr the Great, or, colloquially, the tryzub, the insignia derives from the seal-trident of Volodymyr, the first Grand Prince of Kyiv.<br>
<br>
Tryzub<br>
The modern "trident" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the Ukrainian People's Republic in February 1918. The design has precedents in seals of the Kyivan Rus. The first known archaeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the Rurik dynasty.<br>
<br>
The symbol was also found on the bricks of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Church of the Tithes in Kyiv</span>, the tiles of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Dormition Cathedral in Volodymyr</span>, and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts...<br>
<br>
Most historians agree that the medieval symbol was not intended as depicting a trident, but rather, was a symbol of the Holy Trinity;[2] it also was most likely a stylized falcon.<br>
<br>
The Tryzub is heavily used in the military heraldry to commemorate the participation on the Eastern Front during World War II. At least 36 units of the Italian Army carry the Tryzub in their Coat of Arms, as they were awarded a Medal for Military Valor during their service on the territory of Ukraine.</div></blockquote>

Dormition of the Mother of God <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormition_of_the_Mother_of_God" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormition ... her_of_God</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Dormition of the Mother of God is a Great Feast of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic Churches (except the East Syriac churches). It celebrates the "falling asleep" (death) of Mary the Theotokos ("Mother of God", literally translated as God-bearer), and her being taken up into heaven (bodily assumption). It is celebrated on 15 August (28 August N.S. in the Julian Calendar) as the Feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates the Dormition not on a fixed date, but on the Sunday nearest 15 August. In Western Churches the corresponding feast is known as the Assumption of Mary.<br>
<br>
<br>
.. On 25 June 1997 during a General Audience Pope John Paul II stated that Mary experienced natural death prior to her assumption into Heaven..<br>
<br>
Byzantine Rite<br>
The Feast of the Dormition has a one-day Forefeast and 8[31] days of Afterfeast. The feast is framed and accentuated by three feasts in honour of Jesus Christ, known as the "Three Feasts of the Saviour in August". These are: the Procession of the Cross (August 1), the Transfiguration (August 6), and the Icon of Christ "Not Made by Hand" (August 16). It is customary in some places to bless fragrant herbage on the Feast of the Dormition.<br>
<br>
..The Dormition is known as the Death of the Virgin in Catholic art, where it is a reasonably common subject, mostly drawing on Byzantine models, until the end of the Middle Ages. But often the moment just after death is shown, without Christ, but with the apostles crowded around the bed. <span style="color:#FF0040">The Death of the Virgin by Caravaggio</span>, of 1606, is probably the last famous Western painting of the subject. After this depictions of the Assumption become usual, with the Virgin normally shown alive, rising to Heaven.</div></blockquote>

Puts me in mind of St Petersburg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> formerly known as Petrograd (1914–1924) and later Leningrad (1924–1991), is the <span style="color:#FF0040">second-largest city in Russia</span>... Saint Petersburg is the <span style="color:#FF0040">fourth</span>-most populous city in Europe, the most populous city on the Baltic Sea, as well as the world's northernmost city with over 1 million residents. As Russia's Imperial capital, and a historically strategic port, it is governed as a federal city... named after apostle Saint Peter..<br>
<br>
It is also a seat for the National Library of Russia and a planned location for the Supreme Court of Russia, as well as the home to the headquarters of the Russian Navy, and the Western Military District of the Russian Armed Forces. The Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments constitute a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Saint Petersburg is home to the Hermitage, one of the largest art museums in the world, the Lakhta Center, the tallest skyscraper in Europe, and was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro 2020...<br>
<br>
A former spelling of the city's name in English was Saint Petersburgh, under the influence of burgh. This spelling survives in the name of a street in the Bayswater district of London, near <span style="color:#FF0040">St Sophia's Cathedral</span>, named after a visit by the Tsar to London in 1814<br>
<br>
Saint Petersburg was traditionally called the "Window to the West" by the Russians. The northernmost metropolis in the world, Saint Petersburg is often called the "Venice of the North" or the "Russian Venice" due to its many water corridors<br>

Saint Sophia Cathedral, London <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sophia_Cathedral,_London" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sop ... al,_London</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Saint Sophia Cathedral (Greek: Καθεδρικός ναός της Αγίας Σοφίας) is a Greek Orthodox church on Moscow Road in the Bayswater area of London.<br>
<br>
It was consecrated as the Church of the Holy Wisdom on 5 February 1882 by Antonios, Metropolitan of Corfu, as a focus for the prosperous Greek community that had settled in London, particularly around Paddington, Bayswater and Notting Hill..</div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">London's Oldest Surviving Greek Cathedral Celebrates New Museum Opening</span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120320071306/https://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/time/georgian+and+victorian/art41930" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20120320071 ... n/art41930</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For over 200 years, London has been home to a prominent Greek population, and at the heart of the community is the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sophia, on Moscow Road in Bayswater.<br>
<br>
..When moving down to the lower floor, which is dedicated to the building of the cathedral and the modern day Greek Orthodox Church, you pass a red column that is directly beneath the altar of the cathedral and contains the dedication stone, although George admits that they were not always aware of this, so it was a welcome surprise when they found it.<br>
<br>
Downstairs on show is a small collection of 19th century ecclesiastical objects including some intricately woven priests robes, which were restored by the Byzantine Museum in Athens, and also a very grand crown worn by bishops when officiating in the church.<br>
<br>
A black and white image of former Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, celebrating liturgy with the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Dean of St Sophia is also worth a look. Interestingly, according to George, <span style="color:#FF0040">the large crucifix in the picture (and indeed still hanging in the Cathedral) was featured in the James Bond film, GoldenEye</span>.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A disused Underground station which housed the command bunker for London’s anti-aircraft defences during the Blitz is to be sold off and is expected to fetch more than £20 million.  Brompton Road station closed in 1934 because of a lack of passengers, but gained a new life during the Second World War as a headquarters for gunners fighting waves of Hitler’s bombers.<br>
The station in Kensington has been owned by the Ministry of Defence ever since and is home to local university cadet groups.<br>
The MoD has now announced it will sell the 28,000 square foot building close to Harrods as part of cost cutting, and expects to make more than £20 million. .. <br>
<br>
Brompton Road station opened in 1906 as a stop on the Piccadilly Line and the building still bears the distinctive red-glazed tiles of stations along the route.   The station closed 28 years later due to under use, but in 1938 the War Office bought the above-ground building along with lift shafts, stairs and some of the lower passages. The disused platforms are closed off and still belong to the Tube.<br>
The building became headquarters of the Army’s 1st Anti-Aircraft (AA) Division, protecting the capital and surrounding areas. <br>
<br>
 Floors were built into the lift shafts to create operations rooms complete with a telephone exchange, pneumatic tubes to carry messages and a huge table map of southern England.<br>
Information on approaching German aircraft reached the station from radar stations and observers, and was sent on to fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft batteries.<br>
There are also unconfirmed stories that Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, was questioned at the station after he flew solo to Scotland in 1941 in an attempt to negotiate peace.<br>
The building was used for anti-aircraft operations until the early 1950s, by which time the Second World War defences were considered obsolete. <br>
<br>
The site now houses the London University Air Squadron, the London University Royal Naval Unit, and 46F Squadron Air Training Corps. An MoD spokeswoman said the units would be found new homes before the sale in September</div></blockquote>

Ukraine oligarch Dimitri Firtash (Lev Parnas boss),tied to <span style="color:#FF0040">Cambridge University (Stephen Halper)</span>,also the primary shareholder in Cambridge Analytica. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/GreatAwakening/3662570" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/GreatAwakening/3662570</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As bagman for mobster Semion Mogilevich, Firtash directly links the Russian mafiya to the British Establishment. ..here is evidence that his London associates are linked to Cambridge Analytica and Trump’s impeachment investigation. Firtash is connected to Viktor Tchenguiz, the Iranian businessman who held a majority stake in Cambridge Analytica’s parent company for a decade.<br>
<br>
His fellow shareholder was <span style="color:#FF0040">Roger Asquith</span>, the Third Lord Oxford who sits on the board of Firtash’s Group DF company.<br>
<br>
Cambridge Analytica has worked in Ukraine and its offshoot Acrion Global, founded by Martin Lengyel, pitched to President Volodymyr Zelensky’s team in 2019. Lengyel also worked for Viktor Yushchenko in 2004-05 when the Ukrainian politician was supported by Firtash...<br>
<br>
Anthony Fisher, a senior consultant at Bell Pottinger, was a director of Firtash’s British-registered charitable foundation. Fisher was also a joint founder, along with British Firtash associate Robert Shetler-Jones, of the UK-registered Scythian Limited, which funnelled Firtash cash to the Conservative Party and Tory politicians.<br>
<br>
The firm’s activities were exposed in 2011 when Dame Pauline Neville Jones stepped down as a Security and Counter-Terrorism Minister after receiving donations from Shetler-Jones. However, Fisher continued to work for Firtash and represented the oligarch at the opening of a memorial in Washington on 6 December 2013. His links to Firtash extend beyond his role as a PR consultant and a director of the Firtash-financed British Ukrainian Society.<br>
<br>
Prior to April 2015, he was also a major shareholder in Pallini Holdings – an offshore structure connected to Serhii Lovochkin, a political operator closely linked to both Firtash and Paul Manafort...<br>
<br>
On 9 July 2019, he was photographed with Rudy Giuliani at an event in London to support a charitable group, the British Friends of Anatevka. The picture was posted by the Curzon PR firm where Fisher is a senior consultant...<br>
<br>
The oligarchs grouped around Putin have a vision shared by many “Conservatives”. During the Cold War, the West saw itself as exporting democracy to Russia. However, western societies were always, to some degree, oligarchies.<br>
<br>
Russia is now exporting its values to the West, abetted by Western politicians and oligarchs. They admire Putin’s social model and suck up Russian funding. They aim to replace democracies with elitist fiefdoms.<br>
<br>
The frontline of this war lies in Hong Kong, Syria, Ukraine and wherever popular revolts confront autocracy. History may be coming to an end, as Fukuyama predicted. But, as with many thrillers, there is a final twist.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Maserati/In 1914 Alfieri Maserati established the "Societá anonima officine Alfieri Maserati" (Anonymous society Alfieri Maserati garage), a garage for the manufacturing of the Isotta Fraschini cars. In 1926 the first actual Maserati car, the Tipo 26, was built, featuring the first logo which will characterize Maserati throughout its history:<span style="color:#FF0040"> the trident belonging to the statue of Neptune placed in the fountain in Piazza Maggiore in Bologna, symbol of power and royalty</span>. The logo was designed by Mario Maserati, the brother which had a passion for arts rather than for cars, under the suggestion of the marquis Diego de Sterlich, great family friend and backer of the carmaker. The colours too, red and blue, have their root in the city of Bologna. In 1937 the firm is sold to a family from Modena, the Orsi, whose empire went from the foundries to the metal manufacturing; from such merging two companies were born, bearing the same exact logo : the "Officine Alfiero Maserati" specialized in the manufacturing of the cars and the "Fabbrica Candele Maserati" for sparkplugs and batteries. <br>
<br>
Since then the company moved its headquarters to Modena. In 1951 the logo was inserted in an sharp oval shape; in 1954 there were versions featuring a round shape, possibly due to the absence of regulations. Maserati was then bought by Citroën, after some troubling events, which continued even after the merging, leading to a big crisis in 1973. In 1975 Maserati was acquired by the Argentinian Alejandro De Tomaso; Michele Spera took then care of the restyling, which consisted in adding light blue to the trident. In 1985 there is a comeback to the traditional logo, with modification to small details on the trident and its structure. In 1993 the firm was merged with Fiat and in the same year the logo underwent a restyling, appointed to Ubaldo Righi along with Iosa Ghini Associati. <br>
<br>
..In 2003 Fiat decides to start an advertising campaign to promote the new products manufactured by the company, especially of those directed to foreign countries. The entire corporate design is reinvented and new rules are established regarding the logos: firstly, the font for the logotype was the font Bembo, invented in the XV century by Francesco Griffo of Bologna. ..</div></blockquote>

Fountain of Neptune, Bologna <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_Neptune,_Bologna" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_ ... e,_Bologna</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..The fountain is a model example of Mannerist taste of the Italian courtly elite in the mid-sixteenth century.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/6u4dww.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

The construction of the fountain was commissioned by the <span style="color:#FF0040">Cardinal Legate Charles Borromeo</span>, to symbolize the fortunate recent election of Borromeo's uncle as Pope Pius IV...<br>
<br>
The trident of the Neptune's statue inspired and it was used by Maserati brothers as emblem for their first car, the Maserati Tipo 26. The logo was realized in 1920 by one of the brothers, Mario Maserati, at the suggestion of a family friend, Marquis Diego de Sterlich. This is still today the logo of the Maserati car company ..<br>
<br>
Several copies of the fountain exist around the world, such as in Laeken (a suburb of Brussels) commissioned by king Leopold II; in Palos Verdes Estates in California; and in Batumi in Georgia. A copy of the statue of Neptune can be found at the entrance of the Yamato Museum in Hiroshima, Japan, while a cast - made in 1907 - is kept in the Bologna's Archeological Museum.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>After it turned out that the firm that had done consulting work for the Trump campaign was harvesting information on 50 million Facebook users without their permission, an undercover TV report revealed that it’s also been trying its hand at some more … old-school political maneuverings. Cambridge Analytica executives are filmed offering illegal political intimidation services to its prospective clients, suggesting bribery and blackmail involving Ukrainian sex workers.<br>
<br>
A reporter for the UK TV station Channel 4 posed as a Sri Lankan fixer hoping to enlist Cambridge Analytica’s services for a client aiming to win a local election. Over several months, the reporter filmed his interactions with the company, whose representatives, including CEO Alexander Nix, explained how the company functioned.<br>
“We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” Nix told the reporter.<br>
<br>
He disclosed the company’s methods for undermining opponents, including “sending some girls around to the candidate’s house” (he added that <span style="color:#FF0040">Ukrainian women “are very beautiful, I find that works very well”</span>), or staging a bribe, recording it, and posting it on the internet.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dr. Earl Wayne Hutchins<br>
18 March 1950-14 November 2020<br>
<br>
Earl Wayne Hutchins, age 70, was the fourth of five children born to Hubert Clyde and Cornelia Gilbert Hutchins. Earl was born in Athens, Clarke County, GA, and lived with his family in Auburn, Barrow County, GA. He grew up on the same farm where his father was raised. He graduated in 1968 from Winder-Barrow High School in Winder, then attended the University of Georgia, graduating from there in August 1971. He earned his M.D. from Medical College of Georgia in Augusta in 1975 and entered the U.S. Navy, where he completed his internship and residency in family medicine. He served in Charleston, SC, and Memphis, TN.<br>
<br>
After his tour of duty in the Navy, Dr. Hutchins moved to Greenville, SC, where he joined the staff of Exigent Medical Center in 1981 as an urgent care physician. In 1983 he opened his own urgent care center in Mauldin—Pine Tree Medical Center, which he operated until 1995. He then operated Hillcrest Medical Center, an urgent care and family medicine center in Simpsonville, until 2004. For the next few years, he worked at Doctors’ Care in Simpsonville and other urgent care facilities. At the time of his death, he was providing diabetic counseling for patients at Amnesty Health Group in Greenville.<br>
<br>
Dr. Hutchins married Katherine Sadowski from Lorain, OH, in June 1975. They had two sons, Christopher Hubert and <span style="color:#FF0040">Matthew William Hutchins.</span> Christopher currently lives near Cleveland, OH, with his wife Ann Marie. <span style="color:#FF0040">Matthew resides in Los Angeles, CA, with his wife Halyna and son Andros.</span><br>
<br>
In 2004, Dr. Hutchins married Theresa Hampton, of Fountain Inn, SC. She had worked as his office assistant at Hillcrest Medical Center, and remained his faithful helpmate for the rest of his life.<br>
Earl was preceded in death by his parents. In addition to his wife, sons, and grandson he is survived by brothers Dr. Charles Hutchins of Gastonia, NC, and Randy Hutchins of Linville, NC. Surviving sisters are Dorothy Lindquist of Port Orchard, WA, and Linda Pendergrass of Simpsonville, SC. He is also survived by step-daughters Theresa Ruth Hampton and Carly Judd of Greenville. Surviving step-grandchildren are Andrew Judd and Rachael Noone, as well as step-great granddaughter Amelia Noone.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mikhail Watford was found hanged at home by a gardener on Monday..<br>
<br>
A family friend said Watford, 66, could have been worried over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine following Putin’s invasion launched a week ago, the Sun reports.  Another associate said Watford’s death ‘raises questions’ after other suspicious deaths of Russian nationals in Britain.<br>
<br>
Born Mikhail Tolstosheya in 1955 in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union, the tycoon made his fortune in oil and gas before building a property empire in the UK. He changed his name to Watford when he moved to Britain, where bought homes in Eaton Square in Belgravia, central London; his £18 million mansion in Virginia Water, and most recently, a series of properties on the Wentworth estate, MailOnline reports.<br>
<br>
In 2015, he complained about how difficult it was to find a ‘superyacht-perfect’ mansion outside of London.<br>
<br>
Unable to find a home that fitted his need, he commissioned his own 9,640 sq ft property, complete with wrought-iron gates made by the company that supplied Kensington Palace.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Seán Dunne (born 1954) is an Irish businessman[1] and property developer. He is sometimes referred to as "Baron of Ballsbridge" because of his ambitious development project for the Jury's/Berkeley Court hotels site in Ballsbridge.[2] He left Dublin for the United States after the property collapse of 2007 to 2011.<br>
<br>
In late 1997, Dunne was involved with the Anna Livia Consortium, which hoped to win the competition to build a national conference centre at Grand Canal Dock. The Convention Centre Dublin was ultimately developed by Treasury Holdings at Spencer Dock.[13] The same year, Dunne through Mountbrook Homes and Sean Mulryan through Ballymore properties, bought a 100-acre site south of Greystones, County Wicklow...<br>
<br>
According to documents leaked to WikiLeaks from Icelandic Bank Kaupthing, Dunne paid $2.75m with a loan from Kaupthing, for a 1/16th stake in a Gulfstream Jet, as part of the<span style="color:#FF0040"> Netjets</span> fractional ownership scheme. This was done via an Isle of Man company called Zaskari Ltd<br>

<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181104023936/https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida/fl-ne-sothebys-fraud-scheme-20181018-story.html" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20181104023 ... story.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2018:<br>
<br>
An interior designer in Florida and a fine art consultant in New York stole a woman’s identity and used it to bid millions of dollars on famous paintings and defraud the Sotheby’s auction house, federal prosecutors allege in court filings.<br>
<br>
Antonio DiMarco and <span style="color:#FF0040">Joakim von Ditmar</span> are accused of using the identity of a wealthy, 80-year-old retiree from Bal Harbor to place winning bids on two paintings at a Sotheby’s contemporary art auction in the fall of 2017.<br>
<br>
The South Florida Sun Sentinel previously reported that <span style="color:#FF0040">Fort Lauderdale police arrested DiMarco</span>, 44, of Hallandale Beach on Oct. 10. He is accused of stealing more than a million dollars from wealthy South Florida clients and is facing charges of of grand theft, money laundering and obtaining property worth more than $50,000 by fraud. He is being held without bond in a Broward County jail.<br>
<br>
In the federal case, DiMarco and von Ditmar are accused of snagging an untitled Mark Rothko for $6.4 million and “No. 12” by Ad Reinhardt for $1.16 million.<br>
<br>
..DiMarco and Von Ditmar, an art consultant and fashion designer, are charged with wire fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft.<br>
<br>
A lawyer who represented DiMarco said he is no longer involved in the case and doesn’t know who represents him now.<br>
<br>
Von Ditmar did not respond to an email seeking comment. <span style="color:#BF0040">His defense attorney, Mark Gombiner</span>, declined to comment.</div></blockquote>

Interesting that searching for this story usually just brings up a picture of DiMarco and not Von Ditmar.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Allrise Financial Group is a private equity direct lending and investment company and they have just made their way to the Biggest Little City! On March 23rd, Allrise held a ribbon cutting in honor of the grand opening of their branch in Reno. The Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce Director of Member Engagement, Taylor Russo, presented Chairman and Founder, <span style="color:#FF0040">Vladimir Evseev</span>, and Chief Operations Officer, Yulia Efimkin, with the official certificate of membership into the chamber. What happened after the presentation was unlike any other ribbon cutting before...<br>
<br>
With custom cocktails, local lamb and an interactive pulled mozzarella station, guests enjoyed food and drinks provided by the talented Chef Mark Estee with Liberty Food &amp; Wine Exchange. Food stations weren’t the only entertainment for the Allrise staff and their guests. Local Reno band The Novelists provided lively musical entertainment of both covers and original songs. A branded TapSnap photobooth was available for guests to take photos and save the memories of such a great day for Allrise Financial Group and the Reno branch. Nevada Premier Valet assisted guests in parking their vehicles and ensuring everyone got to the event in a timely manner!<br>
<br>
The highlight of the event was a performance by <span style="color:#FF0040">a new Russian Cirque Du Soleil show (coming to Las Vegas soon) called Intrigue Shows</span>. Creative Director, Sasha Ivanov creators brought a compelling world class acrobatic performance symbolizing the grand opening of Allrise. Three performers captivated the audience with acrobatics, dance and contortion in just a matter of minutes. The climax of the performance was when the contortionist stood upside down on a 5ft tall pole and shot a bow and arrow with her feet into a balloon placed across the room.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Prior to joining Allrise Financial Group, Inna Zhuranskaya was a managing director and the head of real estate debt opportunities in the UK office of Sterne Agee, a 100-year old privately-owned US financial services firm with $26 bn under management. The role comprised of commercial, residential and corporate real estate transactions across the EMEA region. She takes on the role of CEO at Allrise and is responsible for its strategic direction and growth as well as achieving the financial returns for her shareholders. <br>
<br>
..  Allrise started several years ago as a Debt specialist in the US and has grown its business and diversified into investment in real estate equity. The company now has five offices in the US and is involved in several businesses including residential development in California, aircraft engineering in UAE, SME and factoring business in Russia and Ukraine, with a new real estate lending arm is about to launch in CEE. There are also two other categories we cover which include investment in IT and blockchain companies. ..<br>
<br>
However, the sector I would like to draw your attention to is the one often missed from the discussions – it is suitable farmland. Environmental sleuths predict that by 2025, an estimated 1.8 billion people will live in areas plagued by water scarcity, with two-thirds of the world’s population living in water-stressed regions. As fresh water is not an easily tradable commodity, the ways to invest will be either through water infrastructure (such as pipework and desalination equipment), water right or arable land. Investment in the ageing infrastructure might be more obvious but less exciting investment target as the returns are not immediately obvious. <br>
<br>
Alternatively, I would suggest investing in in water-rich farmland. As famous investor Michael Burry, once stated “food is the way to invest in water. That is, grow food in water-rich areas and transport it for sale in water-poor areas”.</div></blockquote></div>
