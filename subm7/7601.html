			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>This is a screenshot from a new Danish TV series for children named Dillermand. It is about a man who has a very long penis. Yes, a children’s TV show focuses on the genitals of a grown man. Here, he “elongates” his member in front of children. They’re desensitizing children to adult sexuality. <a href="https://stillnessinthestorm.com/2021/01/symbolic-pics-of-the-month-01-21/" class="postlink">https://stillnessinthestorm.com/2021/01 ... nth-01-21/</a> </div></blockquote>
<img src="https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dillermand-e1611693381749.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
I had to look this up to confirm.  <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"><br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/06/john-dillermand-denmark-launches-childrens-tv-show-man-giant-penis" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/ ... iant-penis</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John Dillermand has an extraordinary penis. So extraordinary, in fact, that it can perform rescue operations, etch murals, hoist a flag and even steal ice-cream from children.<br>
<br>
The Danish equivalent of the BBC, DR, has a new animated series aimed at four- to eight-year-olds about John Dillermand, the man with the world’s longest penis who overcomes hardships and challenges with his record-breaking genitals.<br>
<br>
Unsurprisingly, the series has provoked debate about what good children’s television should – and should not – contain.<br>
<br>
Since premiering on Saturday, opponents have condemned the idea of a man who cannot control his penis. “Is this really the message we want to send to children while we are in the middle of a huge #MeToo wave?” wrote the Danish author Anne Lise Marstrand-Jørgensen.<br>
<br>
The show comes just months after the TV presenter Sofie Linde kickstarted Denmark’s #MeToo movement.</div></blockquote>

Well, not all the debate is what I would have expected TBH<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Christian Groes, an associate professor and gender researcher at Roskilde University, said he believed the programme’s celebration of the power of male genitalia could only set equality back. “It’s perpetuating the standard idea of a patriarchal society and normalising ‘locker room culture’ … that’s been used to excuse a lot of bad behaviour from men. It’s meant to be funny – so it’s seen as harmless. But it’s not. And we’re teaching this to our kids.”</div></blockquote>

But don't women have penises too? /s<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Erla Heinesen Højsted, a clinical psychologist who works with families and children, said she believed the show’s opponents may be overthinking things. “John Dillermand talks to children and shares their way of thinking – and kids do find genitals funny,” she said.<br>
<br>
“The show depicts a man who is impulsive and not always in control, who makes mistakes – like kids do, but crucially, Dillermand always makes it right. He takes responsibility for his actions. When a woman in the show tells him that he should keep his penis in his pants, for instance, he listens. Which is nice. He is accountable.”<br>
<br>
Højsted conceded the timing was poor and that a show about bodies might have considered depicting “difference and diversity” beyond an oversized diller (Danish slang for penis; dillermand literally means “penis-man”). “But this is categorically not a show about sex,” she said. “To pretend it is projects adult ideas on it.”<br>
<br>
DR, the Danish public service broadcaster, has a reputation for pushing boundaries – especially for children. Another stalwart of children’s scheduling is Onkel Reje, a popular figure who curses, smokes a pipe and eschews baths – think Mr Tumble meets Father Jack. A character in Gepetto News made conservatives bristle in 2012 when he revealed a love of cross-dressing. And Ultra Smider Tøjet (Ultra Strips Down) caused outrage in 2020 for presenting children aged 11-13 with a panel of nude adults, but, argues Højsted, such criticism was unjustified.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>“What kind of culture are we creating for our children if it’s OK for them to see ‘perfect’ bodies on Instagram – enhanced, digitally or cosmetically – but not ‘real bodies’?” she said.<br>
<br>
DR responded to the latest criticism by saying it could just as easily have made a programme “about a woman with no control over her vagina” and that the most important thing was that children enjoyed John Dillermand.</div></blockquote>

It is a dorky looking show <br>

From wikipedia:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The series is aimed at four- to eight-year-olds and was developed by the Danish public broadcaster DR, in association with the sex education association Sex &amp; Samfund.[4] It premiered on 3 January 2021 on DR's children's channel DR Ramasjang.[3] The first season, consisting of 13 five-minute episodes, was made available on the internet on 2 January 2021.[3]<br>
<br>
John Dillermand was popular in Denmark upon release, with 250,000 children viewing the first episode in five days,[5] and went viral.[1] The series has found fans among Danish TV personalities and children;[5] according to a DR executive, children were making snowmen, drawings, dolls and songs about John Dillermand.[5] At the 2021 Fastelavn festivities, John Dillermand was a popular choice of costume.[6]<br>
<br>
Catherine Bennett of The Guardian praised the series as something that British leaders could learn from. But the series' unusual premise was also criticized as pandering to pedophiles,[3] or as making light of the #MeToo movement against sexual violence against women.[3] <br>
<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The DR executive said that the series was part of DR's ambition to make "children's content that dares to tackle embarrassing, difficult, quirky and funny topics", that it was about being true to oneself and one's flaws, and that it acknowledged children's curiosity about human bodies.[5] He said that the series was "as desexualized as it can possibly get", and that it was developed together with a child psychologist and other professionals who reviewed the scripts to ensure that children would not misinterpret what they saw.[5]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A gender studies professor of Roskilde University, Christian Groes, criticized the series for "perpetuating the standard idea of a patriarchal society and normalising ‘locker room culture’" which has been used to "excuse a lot of bad behaviour from men."[7][8]</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

Oh no!  Not locker room culture, that's now tranny territory.  Kids get to avoid that by going to Gay Pride Parades and watch grown men in leather and chains walk each other on leashes while wearing dog masks! /s<br>
