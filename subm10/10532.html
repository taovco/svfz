			<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">TL;DR:</span></strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Q was a load of bullshit and Trump's as corrupt as the next. I was wrong to support either, and also wrong in my assessment of at least the majority of naysayers. I was not a knowing participant in any plot to shut down Voat.
</div></blockquote>

Alrighty... so a statement like this is probably too little and way too late, but after taking some time to myself over the last year or two and coming back for a visit today I feel like now's as good a time as any to make my position known on a few things. Let's knock a big one off straight outta the gate; <strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">Q and Trump and the mess of fighting and paranoia that caused between people on Voat:</em></strong><br><br>
As the TL;DR suggests, my current stance on Q and Trump is that it was the biggest load of shit we've seen in contemporary society in the last decade I would dare to say.While it's true that I was a 'believer' initially and for a while into it all, and it's obvious now that's no longer the case, what's not widely known (especially among those I was at odds with on Voat) is that since at least maybe mid 2018 or maybe earlier, I had been actively looking at my own line of research and observations which made me more and more anti-Q/anti-Trump by the day. For a long time now I have regretted not speaking out about that, for letting the shitshow carry on in the way it did.<br><br>
I could go into the who what and why of how I came to realize just how bad it all was, but that's not really the point here and frankly it would take way to long to write let alone read; I just don't have the energy for that shit anymore and I doubt anyone gives much of a fuck. At the end of the day, I just want it known without doubt that I fucking <em class="text-italics">loathe</em> all the damage caused by Trump/Q and co, to those of us who were at each others' throats on voat and to the rest of the people around the world who got sucked into it and are <em class="text-italics">still</em> brainwashed beyond belief. The <em class="text-italics">only</em> positive that can be salvaged from that shit show is that at least in their own way, hundreds of thousands of people are now actively seeking to root out corruption and worse. But that will never excuse how much it has simultaneously damaged those people and there's certainly no excusing my silence when I should have more actively fought against it.<br><br>
Alongside that I will also freely admit that I most certainly misread the intentions of the majority of Q/Trump naysayers on Voat. While I do suspect that a very small handful were "playing both sides" to keep everyone fighting, I'm gonna go out on a limb and offer a direct apology to the likes of @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1679" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">shewhomustbeobeyed</a> and, if she happens to be around at all, @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11978" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">think-</a>. This far along, I honestly forget who all else I should be extending that apology to, but it is there on the table for anyone else who wasn't acting with malice.<br><br>
The way that Q/Trump divided Voat and in particular those trying to expose pedophilia, was just disgusting and I am sorry for the part I played in that. Which brings me to the next point.<br><br><strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">On the shutdown of Voat and apparent suspicion that I was part of it:</em></strong><br><em class="text-italics">Nothing could be further than the truth.</em><br>
I fucking loved Voat, even the worst times and the butting of heads; it was such a major part of my life and through all the ups and downs it felt good to be actively trying to shine a light on the fuckery we were all looking into. I met some of the strangest, funniest, most dedicated and purpose-driven people of my life there and even though some of you (rightfully) will never trust or like me (duh, welcome to life), I can't imagine not ever having that period play out.<br>
In a long list of things I got wrong, not seeing the writing on the wall re: Voat's shut down is one that stung me as much as it stung all of us when everything was done and dusted. As I said in a comment elsewhere, I have no idea who was just trying to sow discord and who was trying to warn us all in earnest... but those who spoke out about PIA(?) were right. I was wrong. But I absolutely was not part of any coordinated effort to slip PIA in the door or have Voat shut down, no matter how poorly I read the situation.<br><br>
Voat was my dysfunctional second family and I still kinda miss it all despite having moved on.<br>
There's a lot about that whole situation I may never know, regarding who was a "paid agitator" and who wasn't, or "shill" if you like... whatever. I'm just so sorry it all went down the way it did.<br><br>
People change, folks. Situations sometimes become clearer in retrospect. Maybe in time some of you who distrust me come to realize I'm just another person who was trying to figure shit out with good intentions as I came to realize the same about you. For those of you still in the fight to uncover corruption/etc, carry on the torch as long as you can and do what is right in this world. I got burned out and needed to return to observing at best, but the world definitely needs people who will speak up and do the hard work.<br><br>
You have my respect even if I'll never have yours.<br><br>
As a parting gift, if anyone cares to understand just how much I fucking hate Trump and Q these days... <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Aviem Sella</span></strong>. Have fun.<br><br>

I'm not sure how often I'll pop my head in, but at this point in my life I just wanna be able to maybe come say hi and talk a bit of shit with the Voat OGs &lt;3</div>

Alcohol keeps me awake. I can go to sleep, but i can't stay asleep. Maybe if I could sleep off a hangover, I'd like it more? Drink lots of water, your kidneys and liver will thank you.</div>

			<div class="content">Thank you for the update. For the record, I have no intention of doxxing you. @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=51" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">SearchVoat</a> has much stricter doxxing rules (and admin oversight) than Voat, hence the doxxing conversations. I still intend to "dox" the final owner of Voat as he was inactive during the last 2 months of Voat and therefore was never ported over here (thus his dox is allowed)<br><br>
I was, however, very concerned that you were still batting for Q and running interference for the people who ultimately brought down Voat.<br><br>
I originally intended to post my findings to your sub (as "corruptionwatch" felt like a fitting category). But after looking at your own attempts to shutter conversations of the topic, I sought to have you banned from the sub to prevent a mod civil war.<br><br>
Since that doesn't seem to be a risk, you may be an excellent resource. What is your knowledge of Edon and its presence in Voat's Code? I'm still establishing a timeline. <br><br><a href="https://searchvoat.co/search.php?st=comments&amp;t=edon&amp;co=on&amp;forum=on&amp;u=argosciv" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/search.php?st=com ... u=argosciv</a><br><br><a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3686169/22742772" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3686169/22742772</a><br><br>
"You do realize that Voat has been using Edon assets/tech since before PIA made any offer to Voat users, right?"<br><br><a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3686169/22743443" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3686169/22743443</a><br><br>
"Actually, I'm referring to the fact that edon has been in the site's scripts for ages. I've delved into the site's front-end code many times out of curiosity, long before the whole PIA thing, and edon has been present since before then if I recall correctly."<br><br>
I have a few other q's if you're able. Thanks</div>

<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">TL;DR:</span></strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Q was a load of bullshit and Trump's as corrupt as the next. I was wrong to support either, and also wrong in my assessment of at least the majority of naysayers. I was not a knowing participant in any plot to shut down Voat.
</div></blockquote>

Alrighty... so a statement like this is probably too little and way too late, but after taking some time to myself over the last year or two and coming back for a visit today I feel like now's as good a time as any to make my position known on a few things. Let's knock a big one off straight outta the gate; <strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">Q and Trump and the mess of fighting and paranoia that caused between people on Voat:</em></strong><br><br>
As the TL;DR suggests, my current stance on Q and Trump is that it was the biggest load of shit we've seen in contemporary society in the last decade I would dare to say.While it's true that I was a 'believer' initially and for a while into it all, and it's obvious now that's no longer the case, what's not widely known (especially among those I was at odds with on Voat) is that since at least maybe mid 2018 or maybe earlier, I had been actively looking at my own line of research and observations which made me more and more anti-Q/anti-Trump by the day. For a long time now I have regretted not speaking out about that, for letting the shitshow carry on in the way it did.<br><br>
I could go into the who what and why of how I came to realize just how bad it all was, but that's not really the point here and frankly it would take way to long to write let alone read; I just don't have the energy for that shit anymore and I doubt anyone gives much of a fuck. At the end of the day, I just want it known without doubt that I fucking <em class="text-italics">loathe</em> all the damage caused by Trump/Q and co, to those of us who were at each others' throats on voat and to the rest of the people around the world who got sucked into it and are <em class="text-italics">still</em> brainwashed beyond belief. The <em class="text-italics">only</em> positive that can be salvaged from that shit show is that at least in their own way, hundreds of thousands of people are now actively seeking to root out corruption and worse. But that will never excuse how much it has simultaneously damaged those people and there's certainly no excusing my silence when I should have more actively fought against it.<br><br>
Alongside that I will also freely admit that I most certainly misread the intentions of the majority of Q/Trump naysayers on Voat. While I do suspect that a very small handful were "playing both sides" to keep everyone fighting, I'm gonna go out on a limb and offer a direct apology to the likes of @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1679" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">shewhomustbeobeyed</a> and, if she happens to be around at all, @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11978" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">think-</a>. This far along, I honestly forget who all else I should be extending that apology to, but it is there on the table for anyone else who wasn't acting with malice.<br><br>
The way that Q/Trump divided Voat and in particular those trying to expose pedophilia, was just disgusting and I am sorry for the part I played in that. Which brings me to the next point.<br><br><strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">On the shutdown of Voat and apparent suspicion that I was part of it:</em></strong><br><em class="text-italics">Nothing could be further than the truth.</em><br>
I fucking loved Voat, even the worst times and the butting of heads; it was such a major part of my life and through all the ups and downs it felt good to be actively trying to shine a light on the fuckery we were all looking into. I met some of the strangest, funniest, most dedicated and purpose-driven people of my life there and even though some of you (rightfully) will never trust or like me (duh, welcome to life), I can't imagine not ever having that period play out.<br>
In a long list of things I got wrong, not seeing the writing on the wall re: Voat's shut down is one that stung me as much as it stung all of us when everything was done and dusted. As I said in a comment elsewhere, I have no idea who was just trying to sow discord and who was trying to warn us all in earnest... but those who spoke out about PIA(?) were right. I was wrong. But I absolutely was not part of any coordinated effort to slip PIA in the door or have Voat shut down, no matter how poorly I read the situation.<br><br>
Voat was my dysfunctional second family and I still kinda miss it all despite having moved on.<br>
There's a lot about that whole situation I may never know, regarding who was a "paid agitator" and who wasn't, or "shill" if you like... whatever. I'm just so sorry it all went down the way it did.<br><br>
People change, folks. Situations sometimes become clearer in retrospect. Maybe in time some of you who distrust me come to realize I'm just another person who was trying to figure shit out with good intentions as I came to realize the same about you. For those of you still in the fight to uncover corruption/etc, carry on the torch as long as you can and do what is right in this world. I got burned out and needed to return to observing at best, but the world definitely needs people who will speak up and do the hard work.<br><br>
You have my respect even if I'll never have yours.<br><br>
As a parting gift, if anyone cares to understand just how much I fucking hate Trump and Q these days... <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Aviem Sella</span></strong>. Have fun.<br><br>

I'm not sure how often I'll pop my head in, but at this point in my life I just wanna be able to maybe come say hi and talk a bit of shit with the Voat OGs &lt;3

Hey Argo, good to hear you're doing well.  I very much agree with most all of your post, thankfully the goats here are gracious enough not to rub my nose in anything from the past related to those divisive times, or perhaps we're all so freaking burned out on the Q overdose it's better just to be happy to have Q-free space online.<br><br>
Definitely stop by, even if for a snooze (we've downsized! lol)<br>

What is your knowledge of Edon and its presence in Voat's Code? I'm still establishing a timeline.
</div></blockquote>
Very little. I barely remember a thing from back then really, but iirc I had only seen it pop up when archiving pages of Voat (y'know how the archive processing page lists all the resources loading and such?) and when poking around in the html/css/javascript (pure curiosity).<br>
At this point I couldn't even tell you what its function was.<br><br>
Without trying to sound rude, I also have no intention to let myself care enough to ever revisit any of that.<br><br>
As for any further questions... not until you send me a pm here to inform me of your original voat name(s). Again, not trying to sound rude, but frankly the last thing I'm interested in is any sort of interview/interrogation/etc. I just wanna live what little of a life I have left mate.</div>

You def sound more relaxed and agreeable than you once were. From my examination of the archives, you defended voat against any and all accusations of corruption. Were you at all in communication with administration, or simply simping? <br><br>
Happy to send you PM's, but will not be sending you my usernames as I don't want to sour our exchange. Suffice to say we interacted frequently, and often butted heads. <br><br>
But I'm very happy you've come around (in more ways than one), and accept your apology.</div>

Happy to send you PM's, but will not be sending you my usernames as I don't want to sour our exchange. Suffice to say we interacted frequently, and often butted heads. 
</div></blockquote>

Then we're at an impasse. You already know who you're talking to, if you want a fair discourse then we need a somewhat level playing field.<br>
Keeping in mind that I do still have my suspicions about a handful of folks, it would be foolish of me to trust without reason. If you truly weren't acting out of malice when we butted heads, then it's in your interest to let me decide to trust you of my own accord, no?<br><br>
Some voat habits (being wary of probing questions and statements aimed at getting a response when I said I wasn't interested in being questioned) die hard, for good reason.</div>

However, I don't trust you yet, nor should I based on your history or my own suspicions. So the "malice" you speak of could go either way.<br><br>
Since you don't recall much, the risk of revealing my usernames doesn't outweigh the reward of the information you may or may not have. <br><br>
But that may change in time, and I'll continue to persistently question.</div>

Idk what risk I present (though I'm sure others think otherwise). If its any consolation, my suspicions of you are miniscule compared to other users.<br><br>
In any case, onward, and I look forward to your commentary.</div>

However, I don't trust you yet, nor should I based on your history or my own suspicions. So the "malice" you speak of could go either way.

Since you don't recall much, the risk of revealing my usernames doesn't outweigh the reward of the information you may or may not have. <br><br>
But that may change in time, and I'll continue to persistently question.

Oh I can already assure you (though whether you believe that or not is out of my control) there's nothing valuable to gain from me regarding PIA/Edon/etc.<br><br>

As you can tell, @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=152528" class="username">Savesequim</a> is our most charming resident here.  <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">   He did a phone interview with a vampire once (<em class="text-italics">it's a play on names</em>) and I had hoped he'd post it on his new sub so people could have a little background of the kind of research that interests him.  Sadly he's chosen to remain mostly vague with ominous overtones.  I spent the better half of a day looking into what he finally revealed in his posts to you (background info on the companies involved, because I like to research and it wasn't something I had been following at the time, too distracted with PG research and then Q and got sucked into major drama) but who knows what conclusions he's drawn and whether or not those are correct.  Who knows what his motives are tbh.  Writing a book?</div>

Oh that one's easy, though in fairness I can only knowingly speak for myself despite the following general statement (which frankly is applicable to a lot of folks on either side of the proverbial fence(s)):<br><br>
People want to help expose/fix what they perceive to be injustice in a broken world, but that desire can leave anyone vulnerable to being taken for a ride;<br>
Some people wake up and get off the ride, others stay on it without realizing.<br>
There's multiple rides going at once, sometimes we see each other at junctions and find our rides similar but then they diverge again... [Edit to add: sometimes we aren't so friendly with each other at these junctions because the ride we're on makes us believe that only our track can possibly be the real one] around and around it goes.<br><br>
Maybe one day one of them will lead to a better world, but it's highly unlikely because the builder/operator was the problem all along.</div>

Tt was very similar to FreeRepublic which had a proto-Q during the Clinton impeachment called "Quidam". Corsi, Bannon, Stone, and Breitbart were all users of that site. Their later involvement in Q leads me to believe these partisan political psyops have developed over many years and platforms.<br><br>
Another example would be Pieczenik's placement in the infowars/RW podcast nexus and his promotion of Thomas Drake's Operation Greenlight, SandyHook, and the Boston bombing<br><br>
Understanding how these influence campaigns operate is important to stop the inevitable censorship and deanonymization of online discourse.</div>

Their later involvement in Q leads me to believe these partisan political psyops have developed over many years and platforms.</span><br><br>
Another example would be Pieczenik's placement in the infowars/RW podcast nexus and his promotion of Thomas Drake's Operation Greenlight, SandyHook, and the Boston bombing<br><br>
Understanding how these influence campaigns operate is important to stop the inevitable censorship and deanonymization of online discourse.

There were certain aspects/topics of the 'prompts' that Q mentioned that attracted me as I like to research and/or read about corruption/history...<br>
'Formulaic psyops?' (Ironic thing to say I know  <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":?" title="Confused"> )<br><br>
I remember reading this about Corsi but it's so TL/DR I can't easily sum it up.  It's been a long time since I read it and it touches on so many events and public figures going way back.  It'll be worth a reread on my part when I get a chance.<br><br>
Chapter 5. The Poland Connection [64 min read]<br>
Posted on March 20, 2018<br><a href="https://hiddentaxonhumanity.com/hidden-tax-on-humanity/chapter-5-the-poland-connection/" class="postlink">https://hiddentaxonhumanity.com/hidden- ... onnection/</a> by Mel Rockefeller<br><br>
Here's an assortment of excerpts, main focus is on Corsi with references to potential examples of<em class="text-italics"><span style="color:#FF0000"> "political psyops have developed over many years and platforms"</span></em>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
When Bill [Dufty] realized who I am and why we were introduced, he became a real friend and offered advice that helped me grasp the nonlinear “how” of this criminality, including the perps’ use of Hollywood to shape the national narrative. [See Chapter 8.] After an attempt on my life in New Orleans, he urged that I take the family surname to protect myself. <em class="text-italics">[Bill had served as a speechwriter for Walter Reuther, legendary president of the United Auto Workers (UAW).<em class="text-italics">]</em></em><br><br>
...Bob Hertz who described himself as a nephew of the founder of the Hertz rental car company. Hertz, in turn, introduced me to Jerome Corsi in a luxury suite at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Hertz paid the reported $15,000 per night tab for the top-end “fantasy suite.”<br><br>
Corsi immediately told me that he already knew my identity because “being in the anti-terrorism business, me and my partners routinely track Rockefeller family members.” Introducing himself as creator of the B’nai B’rith Mutual Fund in Israel, Corsi proposed that we establish a similar fund in Poland relying on Pyszczuk’s contacts.[5] As usual, I gave everyone benefit of the doubt while also anticipating this could be pre-staging for yet another fraud. I could have walked away. Instead I chose to proceed because the link to Poland suggested this would provide an opportunity to profile those at the core of this ancient duplicity. My intuition proved correct. Corsi was also the first person I heard use the phrase “preparing the minds” to describe what I had been profiling, including their use of cinema to manipulate the national consciousness.<br><br>
*******<br><br>
...According to Randy, the F.B.I. agents had no interest other than framing me for the Corsi-Lindner fraud even though Corsi and Amundson raised the funds and possessed the requisite securities licenses.[31] Randy also described how St. Paul Mayor Norman Coleman insisted that Randy provide the names of those who attended a meeting to discuss the fraud. Randy refused. A Jewish Democrat from Brooklyn, New York, Coleman was elected the Republican Senator from Minnesota on November 5, 2002, 11 days after the death of popular Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone in an airplane crash on October 25, 2002.[32] In 2008, he lost his Senate seat to comedian Al Franken. In February 2017, Coleman was appointed chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition funded largely by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and Mariam, his equally rightwing Israeli wife...<br><br>
...I knew that (a) roughly 90 percent of the Israeli Knesset was then composed of Polish Jews, (b) the Fall of the Wall in 1989 traced its roots to Poland when the Solidarity labor union movement emerged from the Gdansk shipyards in 1980, and (c) Polish Pope John Paul II, the first non-Italian pontiff in four centuries, was then leading one of the world’s most corrupt institutions whose origins in antiquity traced back to those I was profiling. I also knew how the fall of the Berlin Wall was used to brand actor Ronald Reagan (a friend of my Uncle Bob) as a pop culture icon who brought an end to the Evil Empire, a national narrative granted worldwide credibility by those I was profiling.<br><br>
In January 1995, Corsi, Piper Jaffray broker Brad Amundson,[6] Minnesota banker Randy Schwake[7] and I traveled to Poland to meet with Pyszczuk and others to discuss the founding of a mutual fund based on the B’nai B’rith model...<br><br>
...In February, Corsi, myself and our partners met with key executives at Great American’s offices in Cincinatti. CEO Carl Lindner’s personal bio, posted on the American Financial Group website, describes him as “the largest non-Jewish contributor to Jewish causes in the U.S.”[10] Our group stayed in The Cincinnatian whose owner (Lindner) paid for our rooms. [See photo of us taken in front of the hotel.] It didn’t take long to confirm I was again being drawn into the fields within fields of relationships that sustain transnational organized crime.<br><br>
...Confirming Jerome Corsi’s Complicity<br><br>
In an October 1996 meeting in my suite at the Flemings Mayfair Hotel in London, I told David Alexander, CEO of Element Books Ltd., that I believed the Mossad was behind the serial frauds and the criminal stalking I encountered in Poland, Minnesota and elsewhere. I also told him I was working on a rewrite of a book chronicling my life experience. Alexander urged me to get back in touch as soon as the rewrite was complete.[33]<br><br>
On September 7, 1997 I called Glenn Olds and told him that Alexander asked permission to give a copy of my manuscript to Scotland Yard. I also told Alexander that I was in the final rewrite of my book. My comments to Glenn were deliberately false. As I felt certain the Mossad was monitoring my calls, my call to Glenn was a ‘sting operation’ designed to elicit a response if, in fact, the perps were listening. Over the years, I discovered that I was better able to grasp how their cell structure operates if I periodically planted disinformation and then watched as it worked its way through other cells, enabling me to confirm connections between cells.[34] While they were stalking me, I was also stalking them.<br><br><br>
...I explained that I would rather not discuss Corsi’s conduct over the phone and, the next day, sent a letter explaining the reason for my sting operation. On October 7, 1997, I received a fax response from Alexander expressing his concern that I used Element Books to run a (successful) sting operation outing Corsi as an Israeli agent.<br><br><br>
Fields Within Fields…Within Fields, Again<br><br>
During the Poland fraud, Corsi offered to introduce me to anti-terrorism expert Neil Livingstone whose “Crisis Management Inc.” business plan proposed to service the market for terrorist threats—well before 9/11.[36] Livingstone’s 1998 proposal highlighted his close ties to James Woolsey, C.I.A. Director from 1993 to 1995 during Russia’s massive privatization fraud that created a cadre of Russian-Jewish oligarchs. Woolsey merits a closer look to illustrate how I was routinely drawn into their networks of relationships.<br><br>
************<br>
Meanwhile, repeated attempts by Ron and I to catalyze an investigation by federal and state law enforcement, dating from my July 1992 letter to Senator Joe Biden (then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee), met with responses typified by Mark Cullers, Assistant U.S. Attorney in Fresno. Rather than investigate and follow the facts wherever they lead, in August 1993 he assured Ron: “If powerful people in government want someone killed it will get done. The fact that he has lived this long undermines his story.” Had I been dead, apparently my credibility would have been rock solid. Cullers’ response suggests that the fact I’m still alive continues to undermine my credibility.<br><br>
Jerome Corsi—His Payoff<br><br>
Corsi continued to perform as an Israeli agent. In return for his role in stalking me, he was made into a best-selling author of a series of books written to advance Israel’s long-term agenda. Those books include Unfit for Command—Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry (2004). This book was published to help undermine the presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry and keep George W. Bush in office following the disputed 2000 presidential when the Supreme Court ruled Bush the victor. Those who produced the Bush presidency wanted this dysfunctional Christian Zionist in office to take the U.S. to war in reaction to the provocation of 9/11 reliant on intelligence fixed around Tel Aviv’s agenda. The U.S. invaded a nation that played no role in 9/11 as pre-staging to reignite an ancient Shia/Sunni conflict that allied Israel with the Sunni-dominant Gulf States against Shia-dominant Iran.<br></div></blockquote>


<blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">picture</em>Jerome Corsi – Israeli asset/agent from whom I first heard the phrase “prepare the minds.” Corsi has since become the best-selling author of a series of prepare-the-minds books, including Unfit for Command (2004), Atomic Iran (2005), Minutemen (suggesting in July 2006 a Hezbollah terrorist attack in the U.S.), The Obama Nation (2008), et.al.<br><br><em class="text-italics">picture</em> Jerome Corsi who I outed as a Mossad asset/agent in a 1997 sting operation in London.

Corsi is named as the author of several best-selling Israeli psy-ops books, including Unfit for Command (2004), Atomic Iran (2005), Minutemen (2006), The Obama Nation (2008).<br><br>
31. Corsi specialized in “distributing insurance and securities products and services through financial institutions.” See <a href="http://www.theUSAgent.com" class="postlink">www.theUSAgent.com</a> (now a “parked domain”). He boasted about his extensive inside knowledge of the impact of organized crime on the financial services industry, a claim consistent with the fact that our trip to Poland was financially sponsored by a firm controlled by Carl Lindner. ↑</div></blockquote></div>

</div></blockquote>

Understood, in the end it would appear so much of stagecraft among these groups of players (I'm not so familiar with Mel's story, he was involved in the Poland fraud case), but my bias is that really, I don't like or trust Corsi.  I didn't trust Steele, or Stone either, nor Jones and Pieczenik (with his over-the-top theatrical sycophantic praise of Alex Jones.)  <br><br>
Reportedly Corsi (and his partners Amundson and Mel R.) were supposed to pay for the fraud to at least 2 people. This writer quotes the story found here: (paywall <a href="https://archive.ph/BRiGH" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/BRiGH</a>)<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Bradley Amundson was at home in Minneapolis two weeks ago when a familiar face appeared on his television screen. It was Jerome Corsi - a blast from a humiliating time in Amundson's past. "I said: 'Hey, there's Corsi; what's he doing on TV?' " Amundson recalled.<br><br>
Corsi was on a cable show, promoting his new anti-Barack Obama book, "The Obama Nation," but Amundson knows him in a very different context. Corsi, Amundson, and James M. "Mel" Rockefeller of Arizona were principals of a group that launched an investment venture in Poland in 1995 that eventually lost about $1.2 million, much of it raised from a group of about 20 Minnesota investors, Amundson said.<br><br>
In his varied career as best-selling author, conservative journalist, and outspoken polemicist, Corsi has become one of the nation's most controversial political provocateurs. But the business deal that went sour before he became famous has made him the target of bitter criticism.  Corsi's role as investor is perhaps the least known of his several careers. And 13 years after the Poland deal, the fingers of blame are still wagging.<span style="color:#FF0000"> At least two of those investors won court judgments in separate cases filed in courts in Hennepin and Dodge counties in Minnesota against Corsi and his two partners to recoup a portion of the money lost in the Poland deal, but they never collected from Corsi.</span><br><br>
"It was basically a worthless document," said one of those investors, David Splittstoesser, a cement contractor from Rochester, Minn. When his lawyer tried to collect, he found Corsi's assets "had been moved into his wife's name . . . There was nothing to get out of him," Splittstoesser told the Globe.<br><br>
"No comment," Corsi said repeatedly in a telephone interview Monday in response to a series of questions about his role in the Poland investment.</div></blockquote>
