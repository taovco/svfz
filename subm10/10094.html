Detective Sandi Gallant Daly – San Francisco P. D.<br>
Lt. Larry Hones – Boise, Idaho P. D.<br>
Sgt. J. Hill – San Diego P. D.<br>
Kurt Jackson – Beaumont, California P. D.<br>
Gary Bradford and Jim Craig – U.S. Defense Investigative Service<br><br>
Griffis was involved with The West Memphis Three Trials <a href="https://www.famous-trials.com/westmemphis/2287-home" class="postlink">https://www.famous-trials.com/westmemphis/2287-home</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Delving into matters of the occult took center stage with the calling of Dr. Dale Griffis, a "cult expert" from Ohio. Griffis testified that the number three was "one of the most powerful numbers in the practice of satanic belief." When asked on cross-examination whether the number three might also have special significance in the Christian belief system (consider, for example, the notion of the Trinity), Griffis said, "I cannot make that statement." Griffis said that the murderers of the three boys "were using the trappings of occultism during this event," pointing to "the time of the moon phase" and "the removal of blood" as examples of "trappings." Asked what significance the sucking of blood might have, Griffis explained, "Blood is the life force. And usually they will take--they prefer to have a child that is young, very young, and the younger, the more innocent, the better the life force."<br><br>
...With what defense attorneys viewed as their best witness now off the hook, they called as their final witness Robert Hicks, a police training officer with expertise about satanic crime. Hicks testified that he knew of no connection between sexual mutilation and the occult. He also told jurors that "we do have empirical evidence" that listening to Metallica music does not "lead people to commit crimes." He described the phrase "trappings of the occult," used by prosecution expert Dale Griffis, as "absolutely meaningless in considering any kind of violent crime."<br><br>
..In 1996, HBO aired a documentary called <em class="text-italics">Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills</em>. The film, with a sound track by Metallica, depicted West Memphis as a hellhole with residents blinded by fantasies of a satanic cults, and jurors unable to sort facts out rationally.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost:_The_Child_Murders_at_Robin_Hood_Hills" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_ ... Hood_Hills</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills is a 1996 American documentary film directed, produced and edited by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the trials of the West Memphis Three<br><br>
The film starts with an introduction to the case, before moving on to the arrests of the three teenagers. Much of the community, including the detectives and the victims' parents, believe the murders were committed by the teenagers as part of a Satanic ritual. During the trial, Damien Echols is asked about his familiarity with Aleister Crowley's belief system. Echols also states that he likes reading books by Anton LaVey and Stephen King.<br><br>
The community is shown to be politically conservative and strongly Evangelical Christian. Because Misskelley had provided police with a confession, his trial is separated from that of Damien and Jason, and is covered in the first half of the film.<br><br>
..The production had 79 filming days over a 10-month period, starting in the weeks after the murders through the trials and convictions, at the actual Arkansas locations.[2] The movie marks the first time Metallica allowed their music to be used in a movie.[1] A decade later the directors made Metallica: Some Kind of Monster about Metallica.<br><br>
The movie was well received by critics, including <em class="text-italics">Roger Ebert</em>.The film was followed by two sequels. First Paradise Lost 2: Revelations (2000), which suggests that further evidence was missed or suppressed and attempts to prove Echols' innocence. Followed by Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory (2011), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100%</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Roger Joseph Ebert (/ˈiːbərt/; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic, film historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.<br><br>
..Ebert was known for his intimate, Midwestern writing voice and critical views informed by values of populism and humanism<br><br>
.. He wrote Martin Scorsese's first review, for Who's That Knocking at My Door?,[33] and predicted the young director could become "an American Fellini."..<br><br>
Ebert co-wrote the screenplay for the Russ Meyer film Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) and sometimes joked about being responsible for the film, which was poorly received on its release yet has become a cult film.[35] Ebert and Meyer also made Up! (1976), Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens (1979), and other films, and were involved in the ill-fated Sex Pistols movie Who Killed Bambi? In April 2010, Ebert posted his screenplay of Who Killed Bambi?, also known as Anarchy in the UK, on his blog<br><br>
Beginning in 1968, Ebert worked for the University of Chicago as an adjunct lecturer, teaching a night class on film at the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies.<br><br>
In 1975, Ebert received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism<br><br>
In October 1986, while continuing to work for the Sun-Times and still based in Chicago, Ebert replaced Rex Reed as the New York Post chief film reviewer.<br><br>
Also in 1975, Ebert and Gene Siskel began co-hosting a weekly film-review television show, Sneak Previews, which was locally produced by the Chicago public broadcasting station WTTW.[42] The series was later picked up for national syndication on PBS.[42] The duo became well known for their "thumbs up/thumbs down" review summaries. Siskel and Ebert trademarked the phrase "Two Thumbs Up." ..<br><br>
In 2000, Ebert interviewed President Bill Clinton at The White House. Clinton spoke about his love for the movies, his favorite films of 1999, and his favorite films of all time, such as Casablanca (1942), High Noon (1952) and The Ten Commandments (1956). <span style="color:#FF0040">Clinton named Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, and Tom Hanks as his favorite actors.</span>[51]<br><br>
In 2005, Ebert became the first film critic to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame<br><br>
Ebert and Siskel were known for their many appearances on late night talk shows ..<br><br>
In 1991, Ebert, along with Siskel, appeared in a segment on the children's television series Sesame Street entitled "Sneak Peak Previews" (a parody of Sneak Previews).[70] In the segment, the critics instruct the hosts Oscar the Grouch and Telly Monster on how their thumbs up/thumbs down rating system works..<br><br>
n 2004, Ebert appeared in the Sesame Street franchise's direct-to-video special A Celebration of Me, Grover, delivering a review of the Monsterpiece Theater segment of "The King and I".<br><br>
