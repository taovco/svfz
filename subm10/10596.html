Webselenese is the company that hires freelance writers to write "reviews" or "analyses" about the VPN services, which are then used on Wizcase, VPNMentor and whatever else.<br><br>

As is normal in the tech industry, the VPN world is undergoing some major changes and consolidation. The most recent example of this is with ExpressVPN, which announced plans this week to be acquired by Kape Technologies. While this may come as a surprise to some, it is nothing new in the industry. In fact, Kape has been on a VPN buying spree since 2017.<br><br>
Unfortunately, many VPN users remain oblivious about the real owners of the VPN they are using as well as the history behind some of these entities. This is not because the owners are concealing anything, but rather, most “VPN review” websites fail to mention these important facts. This in-depth report intends to reveal the details for all to see. Here’s what we’ll cover:<br><br>
1) Kape (formerly Crossrider) was previously attributed to malware and adware, but it was not in fact responsible for creating the malware (this is addressed in detail here)<br><br>
2) The people behind Kape and Crossrider<br>
3) Crossrider begins purchasing VPN services, then changes name to Kape Technologies<br>
4) Kape purchases a collection of VPN “review” websites, then changes the rankings<br>
5) The future of Kape’s VPN ventures<br><br>
To get a better understanding of the situation, we must first examine the history of Kape.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Kape (formerly Crossrider) created a cross-browser development platform</strong><br>
Before 2018, Kape Technologies was called Crossrider and it was often discussed in the malware and adware industry. You can still find numerous outlets that discussed Crossrider malware and adware infecting various devices, such as with Malwarebytes, Symatec, and Security Beulevard in 2019.<br><br>
Below is an excerpt from a Malwarebytes article that discussed how Crossrider malware infected devices through software bundles:<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Crossrider offers a highly configurable method for its clients to monetize their software. The common method to infect end-users is software bundlers. The installers usually resort to browser hijacking. Targeted browsers are Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and sometimes Opera. Crossrider not only targets Windows machines but Macs as well.<br><br>
PUP.Optional.Crossrider installs are typically triggered by bundlers that offer software you might be interested in and combine them with adware or other monetizing methods. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/pup-optional-crossrider" class="postlink">https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detec ... crossrider</a></div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">While many outlets attributed this “Crossrider malware” to the people/business behind Crossrider itself, the truth is that Crossrider never created malware. Instead, the Crossrider platform was abused by third parties to spread malware and adware.</strong><br><br><strong class="text-strong">Crossrider offered monetization options that were used by ad injectors</strong><br>
We closely examined Crossrider’s history here <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/kape-technologies-crossrider-malware/" class="postlink">https://restoreprivacy.com/kape-technol ... r-malware/</a> and learned that it was a big player in the ad injection industry. In fact, there was even a research paper published by UC Berkeley, Google, and other co-authors who called out Crossrider’s business practices.<span style="color:#FF0000"> PDF</span>: <a href="https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ad-Injection-Crossrider.pdf" class="postlink">https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/w ... srider.pdf</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">Crossrider is a mobile, desktop, and extension development platform that enables drop-in monetization via major ad injectors. Crossrider provides its affiliate ID to ad injectors while separately tracking kick-backs to developers. The other top affiliates listed in Table III are all cross-browser extensions and plugins that impact Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.</em></div></blockquote>

We summarized our investigation into Crossrider’s business history as follows:<br><br>
-Crossrider created a development platform, which was used for many different purposes (both good and bad).<br>
-Crossrider offered monetization options with its platform and was used by major ad injectors.<br>
-Third parties also used Crossrider’s platform for malware distribution, but Crossrider was not the owner or creator of that malware.<br>
-Crossrider completely shut down the program in 2016, changed out the company’s leadership, and pivoted to the privacy and security niche.<br>
-In 2018, Crossrider changed its name to Kape Technologies.<br>
Now that we’ve examined the business operations of Kape/Crossrider, let’s look at the leadership.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">The people behind Kape and Crossrider</strong><br>
The main investor behind Kape is Teddy Sagi, an Israeli billionaire who previously spent time in jail for insider trading <a href="https://archive.ph/ER7yd" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/ER7yd</a> — but this happened all the way back in 1996, early in Sagi’s career. Sagi acquired Kape Technologies in 2012 and is an investor in many other industries.<br>
Interestingly, Sagi is also named in the Panama Papers <a href="https://archive.ph/kevLm" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/kevLm</a> that detail a “rogue offshore financial industry.” <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/" class="postlink">https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/</a><br><br>
Another key figure behind Crossrider/Kape is Koby Menachemi. Forbes wrote an interesting article on Menachemi <a href="https://archive.ph/L6YJr" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/L6YJr</a>, detailing his ties to Israeli intelligence and cyber espionage.<br><img src="https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/surveillance-kape-expressvpn.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br>
surveillance kape expressvpn<br>
Forbes noted the ties that Crossrider had to Israeli state surveillance entities:<br><br>
A vast number of companies are affiliated with ad injectors, either packaging their tools or funnelling ads down to them. One of the biggest is Crossrider, the majority stake of which is held by billionaire Teddy Sagi, a serial entrepreneur and ex-con who was jailed for insider trading in the 1990s. His biggest money maker to date is gambling software developer Playtech. Co-founder and CEO Koby Menachemi was part of Unit 8200, where he was a developer for three years.<br><br>
What went unnoticed, until now, is that most of the searchable organizations involved in this potentially dangerous business are based in Israel. They also happen to have links to the nation’s military and its top signals intelligence agency, the Israeli equivalent of the NSA or GCHQ: Unit 8200, which works out of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).<br><br>
It’s important to note, however, that Menachemi is no longer with Kape. And as we noted here, nearly the entire leadership of Crossrider left the company when Crossrider closed down its development platform. Furthermore, today, Kape is led by CEO Ido Ehrlichman, who was never part of Crossrider.<br><br>
Interestingly, we also just learned that ExpressVPN’s CIO, Daniel Gericke, also has ties to state surveillance activities. According to Reuters, Gericke and two others are accused of “violating U.S. hacking laws and prohibitions on selling sensitive military technology” to the United Arab Emirates. According to reports, this “sensitive military technology” helped the UAE spy on dissidents and human rights activists.<br><br>
“Hackers-for-hire and those who otherwise support such activities in violation of U.S. law should fully expect to be prosecuted for their criminal conduct,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Mark J. Lesko for the Justice Department’s National Security Division said in a statement.<br><br>
Note: We have an article on this case as well:<br>

Make of this situation what you will. However, keep in mind that when you use a VPN, you are trusting the service to handle all of your internet traffic and not do anything questionable in the background.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Crossrider begins purchasing VPN services, then changes name to Kape Technologies</strong><br>
Now that you understand the background and leadership behind Kape Technologies, let’s examine its involvement in the VPN industry.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">2017: Crossrider purchases CyberGhost VPN for $10 million</strong><br>
Crossrider’s first big VPN acquisition was in March 2017 when it purchased CyberGhost VPN for about $10 million. Originally founded in 2004, CyberGhost was a big player in the industry that experienced rapid growth before it was acquired.<br><br><br><strong class="text-strong">2018: Crossrider changes name to “Kape”</strong><br>
Sometime in 2018, Crossrider decided to change its name to “Kape Technologies” as part of a rebranding effort. Ido Erlichman, the CEO of Kape, stated that the name change was an attempt to distance Kape from “past activities”:<br><br>
The decision to rename the company, explains Erlichman was due to the strong association to the past activities of the company as well as the need to enhance the consumer facing brand for the business.<br><br>
CyberGhost founder Robert Knapp also stated in a blog post that Crossrider was an “ad tech” company that did the “opposite” of what CyberGhost does (privacy and security):<br><br>
While CyberGhost focused on privacy and security from day one, Crossrider started out as a company that distributed browser extensions and developed ad tech products. Quite the opposite of what we did.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">2018: Kape purchases Zenmate VPN for $5 million</strong><br>
Not being content with just one VPN service, Kape then moved on to purchase Zenmate VPN, based in Germany, for around $5 million.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">2019: Kape purchases Private Internet Access for $127 million</strong><br>
The next acquisition came in 2019 when Kape purchased Private Internet Access (PIA) for $127 million in cash and shares. <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-kape-revenue-doubles-following-pia-acquisition-1001342824" class="postlink">https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-kape ... 1001342824</a><br>
At the time, PIA was a major player in the VPN industry with a substantial user base.<br><br>
We wrote an article <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/private-internet-access-kape-crossrider/#comment-225714" class="postlink">https://restoreprivacy.com/private-inte ... ent-225714</a><br>
about it back in 2019 and described how many PIA users were upset about the acquisition and did not trust Kape. This screenshot from a PIA user on the PIA subreddit summarizes the sentiment of some users.<br><img src="https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIA-merger-with-Kape-768x287.png" class="postimage" alt="Image">[/quote]<br><br>
But the acquisitions were not over…<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">2021: Kape purchases ExpressVPN for $936 million</strong><br>
The latest major VPN acquisition we have for Kape Technologies is ExpressVPN, which it agreed to purchase for nearly $1 billion. This is by far the largest VPN acquisition to date and a major addition to Kape’s portfolio.<br><br>
Watching this same story play out over and over again over the past four years is kind of like Groundhog Day. We generally find two reactions, with the user base being upset and the acquired VPN trying hard to calm everyone down.<br><br><img src="https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/expressvpn-users-upset-1536x629.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><img src="https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/expressvpn-sold-to-kape-technologies.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br>
Let’s see how many more times this same story plays out with future VPN acquisitions.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">Kape purchases a collection of VPN “review” websites for $149 million, then changes the rankings</strong><br><br>
In another twist to the plot, Kape Technologies also purchased a collection of VPN review websites in 2021. Yes, you got that right. The parent company that owns these VPNs now also owns a few high-profile websites that “review” and recommend VPNs to users around the world.<br><br>
This is clearly a conflict of interest, but that goes without saying.<br><br>
In May 2021, news broke that Kape had purchased a company called Webselenese. According to various press releases, we learned that Webselenese operates out of Israel and runs the websites vpnMentor.com and Wizcase.com. Collectively, these two websites have monthly search traffic of around 6.1 million visitors according to Ahrefs traffic analysis tool (September 2021).<br><br>
Note that there may be other VPN review websites in Kape’s portfolio that we’re not aware of.<br><br>
We also have a dedicated article on this topic:  <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn-review-websites-owned-by-vpns/" class="postlink">https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn-review-w ... d-by-vpns/</a><br><br>
Visiting vpnMentor’s homepage today, we find that the parent company’s three large VPN services all hold the top 3 spots in the rankings of the best VPNs for 2021.<br><br><em class="text-italics">9 Best VPNs in 2021 for PC, Mac, &amp; Phone – 100% SECURE</em><a href="https://archive.ph/T8J4v" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/T8J4v</a><br><br><img src="https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vpnmentor-kape-expressvpn-1-768x507.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Wizcase.com: Similarly, we find the exact same top 3 rankings on Kape’s other website Wizcase.com. <a href="https://archive.ph/ef2l2" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/ef2l2</a><br><br>
Note: As we showed here, [link below] both vpnMentor and Wizcase had NordVPN and Surfshark in their top rankings just a few months ago. However, since Kape purchased these websites, we see big rankings changes, with all of the top 3 recommendations given to Kape’s own VPN companies. However, ExpressVPN has held the top #1 spot, even before the recent acquisition was announced. You can see the exact changes (before and after the Webselenese acquisition) documented in this article. <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn-review-websites-owned-by-vpns/" class="postlink">https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn-review-w ... d-by-vpns/</a><br><br><strong class="text-strong">The future of Kape’s VPN ventures</strong><br>
If the past is an indication of the future, Kape will continue to expand its holdings in the cybsersecurity and VPN industry, which only continues to grow. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future, this conglomerate of VPNs and VPN review websites will be spun off and potentially sold as its own company.<br><br>
In the meantime, there are now millions of VPN subscribers who fall under Kape’s ownership and control. Unfortunately, none of Kape’s VPNs that I have tested have been stand-out performers. The one exception would be ExpressVPN, but it too has fallen behind in the past year and dropped a few spots in our rankings, which are regularly updated to reflect industry news and our own test results.<br><br>
Hopefully, this trend in consolidation will slow down as it gives the end-user fewer choices with independently-owned VPN services.</div></blockquote>
