			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Most people didn’t see this coming: Where the “unvaccinated” were once treated like lepers, with many suggesting that Covid restrictions be used to prevent them from fully participating in society and commerce, the worm may now be turning.<br><br>
In fact, the vaccinated are increasingly persona non grata with women (and men) now when it comes to dating, according to author and TEDx speaker Laura J. Wellington.<br><br>
In a piece published Friday, Wellington states that this has made an already tough dating climate all the more problematic for some unvaccinated women. Part of the concern, with our society’s acceptance of fornication, involves things attending intimate relations, such as salivary exchanges. Of course, this is also a consideration for those who still reserve such relations to marriage.<br><br>
Perhaps stating the obvious, Wellington writes that the “overriding concern [is] that the harmful effects of this vaccine may, ultimately, enter these women” during intimate contact.<br><br>
If this seems fanciful, note that the president of Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division, Stefan Oelrich, admitted to “international ‘experts’ during a globalist health conference [in October 2021] that the mRNA COVID-19 shots are indeed ‘cell and gene therapy’ marketed as ‘vaccines’ to be palatable to the public,” reported LifeSite last year.<br><br>
Given this, that what’s not palatable now is closeness with the “vaccinated” (genetically altered?) makes sense to many Americans. To them, it’s not at all as fanciful as saying that the “unvaccinated” shouldn’t be allowed to circulate in society because they haven’t taken a preventative drug that doesn’t actually prevent a feared disease’s transmission.<br><br>
As for these women who “chose to remain unvaccinated for a reason, mitigating any risk by eliminating candidates based upon vaccine-status has become their new norm,” Wellington writes. This does come with downsides, though; for one thing, men who were compelled to take the gene therapy agents (GTAs) and are rejected in romance on that basis don’t take it very well, avers Wellington.<br><br><br>
“I have been called names for stating that the vaccine is a dealbreaker for me,” the writer quotes one Anika Janis as saying.<br><br>
“For these women, there is simply not enough information about the vaccine or its effects to warrant consideration,” explains Wellington. “No one knows the ramifications or what is to come for those who took the vaccine.”<br><br>
This is entirely realistic. Our medical establishment sold the public the GTAs under false pretenses, making bold claims about their efficacy that fell flat; in fact, these same pseudo-elites mishandled the Covid situation in every way and then lied at every turn.<br><br><br>
Wellington mentions this, stating that for the women in question, “science ‘speaking to the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines’ does little to remove the fear associated with what they are observing all around them simply because ‘no one knows who to trust anymore.’”<br><br>
They’re far from alone, too. Wellington states that many GTA-free parents are cautioning their children about dating the GTA-saddled, and some single men are also balking. And several GTA-free married women “have noted to me that ‘divorce has been become an option’ if their husbands buckled to the pressure of being vaccinated,” Wellington further informs.<br><br>
What’s more, some people are concerned about “vaccinated blood” (even if they aren’t Count Dracula). As Moa Refm, another woman quoted by Wellington, put it, “Unfortunately the blood supply is contaminated too, so no blood transfusions.”<br><br>
Wellington concedes that some of these people’s positions may soften with time. “But many say ‘No,’ she relates, “citing differing vaccination statuses and ‘overall perspectives between vaccinated and unvaccinated’ being just too great.” And, really, it’s these social concerns more than the health ones (which some consider a stretch) that are most relevant.<br><br>
As a Kathy McPherson put it, relates Wellington, “It (the vaccine) says a lot about who these men are at the core, including their level of awareness and definition of life.”<br><br>
It certainly does, generally speaking — just as wearing a mask while alone outside or in your car speaks volumes.<br><br>
Wellington’s claims were seconded by commenters under her article. “Dorothy Todd” said that she would also refuse a blood transfusion over GTA concerns. “Curt” weighed in on the character issue, writing, “The damaged blood is one thing, living with a coward is another thing altogether.” “Neil Timmerman” opined likewise. You can “add me to your tally of people who prefer not [to] date the “vaxxed,” he wrote. “They have proven to have bad judgement.”<br><br>
There was mockery, too — from the “other side.” “Larry Svestka” wrote that being “unvaccinated is now like belonging to a religion.” This is ironic since, speaking for many Branch COVIDians, New York Governor Kathy Hochul proclaimed last year that the GTAs are “from God” and that we should all be her “apostles” and push the shots.<br><br>
Now, sonny, find yerself a nice Catholic girl with no tattoos (and no purple hair or pierced eyebrow),” Svestka continued, “and one who hasn’t put that demonic poison in her veins.”<br><br>
Aside from being (inadvertent) great advice, this comment reflects a divide Wellington addresses. “Who would have ever thought that ‘vaccine status’ would become so central to cultivating new friendships and love relationships for much of our nation?” she writes. “The divide is here to stay because the damage that caused it has already been done. Nothing can put that genie back in its bottle.”<br><br>
Well, God can. But this would require that people once again start putting Him before needles, government health gurus, and Big Pharma fantasies.</div></blockquote>
