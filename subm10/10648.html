 (Initially I thought this must be a tranny and then I thought this person was only deranged and then I found this: <a href="https://www.tellerreport.com/tech/2022-10-18-info-europe-1-%E2%80%93-murder-of-lola--what-the-main-suspect-said-in-police-custody.BklmrbhjQs.html" class="postlink">https://www.tellerreport.com/tech/2022- ... bhjQs.html</a><br>
 (Too gross to post all the details of the account but why is the person referred to as 'he'?  Not the first article I've seen it either.)<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Regarding the motive of the crime, the investigators of the crime squad are themselves distraught in the face of what over the hours takes on the appearance of a gratuitous crime without any serious reason.<br><br>
Always according to the words of Dhabia B., a banal altercation would be at the origin of the dispute which opposes <span style="color:#FF0000">him</span> to the mother of the victim<br><br>
The latter is a caretaker in the residence...<br><br>

Now I'm thinking the changing pronouns are due to translation of French to English, as French has gendered words... The victim is also referred to as 'he' at one point.<br><br><br><br><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/10/20/alleged-murderer-of-12-year-old-french-girl-lola-had-deportation-order/" class="postlink">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/1 ... ion-order/</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dhabia B., the Algerian illegal migrant woman accused of raping and murdering 12-year-old French girl Lola last Friday, is said to have been under a deportation order and should have been removed from the country last month.<br><br>
The 24-year-old Algerian illegal was arrested for the murder of 12-year-old Lola over the weekend and indicted for murder, torture, rape and acts of barbarism earlier this week by prosecutors in Paris.<br><br>
However, it has emerged that the Algerian woman, who entered France under a student residence permit in 2016, was subjected to a deportation order and was obliged to leave the country before September 21st of this year, Europe1 reports.<br><br>
Following her arrival in 2016, French state services lost track of the Algerian but on August 21st she attempted to fly from Paris’ Olry airport where she was arrested for lacking a valid residency permit.<br><br>
She was later questioned by police and subjected to an obligation to leave French territory (OQTF) that day by the French Interior Ministry. Despite this, no effort was made by French authorities to actually deport the 24-year-old back to Algeria, with some noting that 12-year-old Lola may still be alive if the deportation had been carried out.<br><br>
France in Shock: Algerian Migrants Charged for Brutal Rape and Murder of 12-Year-Old Paris Girl <a href="https://t.co/49yFmqGTMw" class="postlink">https://t.co/49yFmqGTMw</a><br><br>
— Breitbart London (BreitbartLondon) October 18, 2022<br><br>
On Wednesday, a French police officer from the department of Essonne noted that deportation orders are rarely ever carried out, even if the illegal migrant has a criminal record.<br><br>
“There is a non-application of the law,” the officer said and added, “When we control someone, even if he has committed a crime, the OQTF is [put on hold] because the service in charge always sends us the same decision, namely, to let the person go, reminding him that we must comply with the law of the country that no longer welcomes him.”<br><br>
The lack of deportations in practice comes despite promises by Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin earlier this year to do more to facilitate the deportation of criminal migrants. In July, Darmanin called for reforms to allow deportations of criminal migrants no matter what their legal status was.<br><br>
“Today, a foreigner who has committed serious acts is not expellable as long as he meets certain conditions, such as arriving on the national territory before the age of 13,” he said and went on to add, “We want to allow the expulsion of any foreigner found guilty of a serious act by the courts, regardless of his condition of presence on the national territory.”<br><br>

Two men and two women, all Algerian nationals and aged between 24 and 43, were later arrested over the weekend, with the two women said to be sisters.<br><br>
On Monday, two of the suspects were released from custody, while the remaining two, a woman named Dahbia B. and an unnamed 43-year-old man, were remanded into pre-trial detention and indicted for the murder of a child under 15, rape of a child, as well as charges of torture and barbarism and concealment of a corpse, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office.<br><br>
Georges-Brassens College where Lola attended school is now implementing a policy to make sure all students are not unaccompanied, with one parent commenting, “We are sad this morning. My daughter cried and didn’t sleep all night. She knew Lola, had gone to her house several times for birthdays.”<br><br>
“There is no trust in the neighbourhood anymore. My wife or I, we will be there, present, every morning and every evening,” the parent added.</div></blockquote>

The body of the schoolgirl was found Friday night in a trunk in the courtyard of a building in the nineteenth arrondissement of Paris, where she lived with her parents.
