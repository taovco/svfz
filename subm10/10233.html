			<div class="content">So I will post my response here instead. <br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>Now the heat has died down a bit I decided it's time to speak up again.</div></blockquote>Heat signifies you're being pursued by the law. This sounds like you are a criminal on the run.<br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>I've been told that @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2109" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">antiliberalsociety</a> has been banned on a number of other sites and I can see why.</div></blockquote> Ruqqus, owned by jews and for telling the truth, Talk.loli for off platform laughter and being anti pedo, and ConPro for a few minutes over a fake dox accusation. <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>He's one big ball of abuse and paranoia. I can't be bothered to respond to his endless taunts and questions because it's really, seriously, incredibly boring. Whenever I speak up he just redoubles the abuse. It's completely pointless.</div></blockquote> AKA you have no good answer to your own actions. What you essentially did was discredit everything the Voat label stood for. @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1689" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">PuttItOut</a> let the community police itself. You come right out and call yourself a dictator. You don't even let moderators ban from their own subs. <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>My principles prevent me from just giving him the flick but by God it's tempting.</div></blockquote> What's the matter? Am I asking the wrong questions? You don't like accountability? <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite> So I just attached a bot to his chat posts (I think of it as a user flair) and banned him from replying to posts here in v/Announcements.</div></blockquote> AOU has <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">TWO</span></strong> little sisters?? <br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>He has posted so often that "this site is dead" and "the mask has dropped" and "pedo-enabler" blah blah blah that I assume everyone just got fed up with it and pushed off.</div></blockquote> Interesting wording, you <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">assume</span></strong> that it's all my fault, but couldn't have anything to do with you turning to censorship to protect a pedophile, could it? <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite> I know I would have. The ironic thing is that he's pretty much the only guy still here. So he obviously still thinks SVF has value.</div></blockquote> Only a few people actually deleted, but your only content contributor is @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2130" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">doginventer</a> the fake Christian turning a blind eye to everything, whom also happens to have the only upvote given in v/MarkRyden. Staying to watch the shithole burn isn't "value". You destroyed it yourself. <br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>I'll get round to making a thread of his torrential chat messages one day but for now you'll get an idea from /search.php?st=comments&amp;forum=on&amp;u=antiliberalsociety.</div></blockquote> That's yet another (((Blume))) tactic, linking to a search that doesn't give context. I stand by my every word. <br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>I have absolutely no idea what he's trying to achieve, other than burning down SVF for the thrill of it. So be it. I really couldn't give a shit. This place will still be here forever, even if it's completely empty. A historical record.</div></blockquote> Cognitive dissonance, you know damn well as I've said it a million times, but like your dingle berry dingus smack friend, you have to ignore incriminating facts to save face. You argue like a jew by pretending to be an innocent simpleton - yet you wrote a bot script to hound my questioning you... And - historical record? Does that include the archives @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2839" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">MadWorld</a> caught you editing, thus undermining its credibility? <br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>He's directly accusing me of being a pedophile. That accusation doesn't bother me, but maybe it bothers other people, so I'll do what I can to lay that bs to rest.</div></blockquote> That in itself is bullshit - who the fuck is even left for it to bother? You're trying to make it out like it doesn't bother you when it clearly does - to a point you censored your own confession despite it not breaking any rules - and self admittedly because it put your "case" in jeopardy. <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>The fact is that pedophiles aren't (or rather, weren't until last week) on my radar at all.</div></blockquote> Hard to believe seeing as you had pedo tags for (((Blume's))) sub... <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite> I'm not aware of any pedos IRL, I'm not aware of anyone who has been abused by one, it simply doesn't come up in conversation. </div></blockquote> Except in your abuse case... <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>It's just not an issue for me. (Of course, maybe people I know are pedos, maybe I know people who've been abused by pedos, I'm just not aware of it.) Maybe it should be an issue for me. But it isn't. Do I have to say it? I have no prurient interest in children. The idea is revolting.</div></blockquote> That begs the question why you gave Blume a pedo sub, and had pedo tags for content on your own site? See this is where your story breaks down. It's also interesting that you say you have "no prurient interest in children" yet you allowed it's content on here, and protected the Jewish author of it by changing the definition of dox to accommodate him. <br><br><a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=10115" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=10115</a><br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>His accusation seems to rest entirely on an unguarded comment I made a few weeks back. I'm not going into again here, but he is - possibly deliberately - misinterpreting it. No one has ever accused me of abusing kids (until he did lol). I have nothing more to say about my personal life. Period.</div></blockquote> You sure Nope'd out of that one fast <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> Your "unguarded comment" was actually plural and it paired with your actions. You denied Blume's "hands up" photo, consisting of underaged girls 12-16 in full frontal nudity, was CP. Yet, you banned him for something that wasn't even referencing anything sexual. This makes you full of shit. Your actions don't coincide with your words. <br><br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/msycu4.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>As for the supposed "pedo play area", I used to see that as merely an unfortunate side-effect of the "anything US legal" rule. Now I have realised two things: 1. I am not a lawyer, even less a US lawyer, and I'm in no position to judge what's legal and what isn't. And 2. active pedos do not deserve anything good, particularly not a "free speech site" where they can meet and share dark web passwords.</div></blockquote> Yet you seem to play lawyer with what constitutes a dox, saying even public information being repeated is a dox. And you did this to protect a jew pedophile, now banned, despite no verification it was actually him. You took his word for it and ignored the avalanche of proof it wasn't a dox coming from your long time contributors. Then you want to say they just got sick of *me* and left? You're full of yourself and you're full of shit. <br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>@<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=722" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">blumen4alles</a> is a pain in the arse. He gets off on posting stuff that people find offensive, skating as close to the ban line as he can without crossing it.</div></blockquote> Yet he did cross it 3 times and despite many pleas to, you didn't ban him. When you finally did ban him, it wasn't something that broke the new rule. <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>I've said many times, I won't ban people for being assholes. I'm an asshole myself, I have some sympathy for them /s.</div></blockquote> You don't fit the profile of an asshole, because an asshole isn't so fragile he wants to kill him self because he got owned by a woman. I was the one that told you to find the asshole within to combat her, after your first suicide post. But that was before you spilled your mental illness, drug addiction, abuse shit. <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>But he couldn't help himself, even though he knew about the rule change, from posting his pictures of little girls. Old habits die hard. Insta-ban. Couple of people questioned why, in chat, one of his alts (was it @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3041" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">BareBackOpSec</a>?) asked why b4a had been banned and I said something like "for posting with alts" because I was being a smartarse and banned BBOS too. I overstepped there. There's no rule against alts. Oops.</div></blockquote> Then why did you tell us to let you know of his other suspected alts? You did that for ban evasion. In fact, in your dox threat you said you'd do your best to make sure the banned will never return. <br><br>
From the chat:<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>BareBackOpSec • Fri Sep 02, 2022 12:11 am
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SearchVoat wrote: ↑02 Sep 2022 00:08<br>
Make the most of that message above. It's the last one @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=722" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">blumen4alles</a> posted before he was banned.</div></blockquote>
What was the ban for?</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SearchVoat • Fri Sep 02, 2022 12:27 am<br>
ban evasion with alts</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>antiliberalsociety • Fri Sep 02, 2022 1:10 am<br>
But that <strong class="text-strong">IS</strong> his alt...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SearchVoat • Fri Sep 02, 2022 1:44 am<br>
Anyway I'm done with this. Just let me know if you suspect another alt.</div></blockquote>

Continuing with his post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>btw he's not my "friend". There are no friends here.<br><br>
Somewhat ironically, I am 100% convinced b4a is not a pedo IRL. Real pedos keep very, very quiet about it. They do not post borderline CP with poor opsec. That guy is way too smart to flaunt it like that if he was actually diddling kids. He's just a very annoying troll.</div></blockquote> Wait wait wait, I thought you said you knew nothing of pedos, weren't aware of them - now you're an expert on what classifies one? You say he's not a friend, yet you're jerking him off pretty hard here. What makes you think pedos keep quiet about it? Have you not been reading your own site's content on the tranny toddler movement? Or how about the teacher defending pedophiles that got fired? You're going to maintain they're not pedos because pedos try to hide it? <br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>A lot of people seem to assume that everyone is hiding a part of themselves, or trying to present a version of themselves that is better than the truth. Therefore we should always be looking for the truth behind the words. That's ALS constantly going on about "the mask has dropped". Sorry to break it to you, but I have no mask. Everything I say is 100% what I truly believe. Maybe that's an "autistic" thing to do, I have no idea, I really don't care. It's how I roll and I like it.</div></blockquote> Nigger, please. You have more to hide than Blume does. It was your actions that gave you away. If you didn't have a mask, why did you shoah your confession posts? How was it able to be a risk to your case?<br><blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>Anyway that's it for now. I love youse all. </div></blockquote> Whoever's left that is <blockquote><div><cite>SearchVoat wrote:</cite>And for Christ's sake don't worry about me. I'm having the time of my life.</div></blockquote>Not having a job, wife, kids? Pretending your kids are dead when you see them for a supervised 2 hours? Resorting to censorship to hide the truth about ya? Appearing on an SBBH podcast to dignify your existence? Doing drugs while mentally ill whilst cops busting into your house while you're scrambling to put clothes back on and shutting down your server in the process? <br><br>
Oh, yes, sounds lovely. <br><br>
And don't think I didn't notice you adopted yet another troll tactic of (((Blume))) by slandering me in a sub that I'm banned from so I can't defend myself. He bragged that was his favorite trick that gabara taught him. <br><br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/9f32lo.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"> Don't keep him waiting, rockspider.</div>

It's how the law works by the way, you don't convict someone for something that's not against the law because we use our fucking brain and anyway the guy deserves it. Or at least that's how it's supposed to be</div></blockquote>Except when the law is made by you, and you can censor at will with impunity, right? You said this defending that Jewish pedophile. <blockquote class="uncited"><div>SearchVoat • Sat Sep 03, 2022 12:43 pm

It's just nice to have a place where <em class="text-italics">I</em> can post, and others can respond, without you shitting all over the place.  Mods have always been able to ban users from their subs without giving a reason.  There are no specific subverse rules.</div>

Banning you from Announcements wasn't to prevent you "calling out" anything. You're posting here without any problem. It's just nice to have a place where <em class="text-italics">I</em> can post, and others can respond, without you shitting all over the place.  Mods have always been able to ban users from their subs without giving a reason.  There are no specific subverse rules.
</div></blockquote>

Yet we can't ban unless <strong class="text-strong">YOU</strong> give your blessing. And guess what? You never banned Blume from my subs when I requested it. I also like how you locked the ban list so I couldn't point that out. <br><br><a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=30190#p30190" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=30190#p30190</a><br><br>
You fear free speech because free speech threatens your freedom.</div>

You are correct, I was wrong.  I don't recall why I didn't implement the bans.  I'm sorry for not doing so, and I'm sorry for doubting your claim in this case.

So, let's test consistency in rule enforcement, shall we? <br><br>@<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=51" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">SearchVoat</a> in this podcast, the user @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=722" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">blumen4alles</a> is mentioned by actual name and thus violates Rule #1 after the website was warned. You were a part of this podcast and posed no warnings for doxxing. You did say that they have to be an "active user" here, however in this case you told me you would "still disallow it". So by that standard, this post violates the "No Dox" rule #1. <br><br>
Per your statements in chat (that weren't altered): <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>SearchVoat • Sat Sep 03, 2022 5:16 pm<br>
but als's question is, is it allowed to "dox" someone who's no longer on the site? hmm...<br><br>
SearchVoat • Sat Sep 03, 2022 5:16 pm<br>
i think in the context of the last few days i'd disallow it</div></blockquote>

@<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=152528" class="username">Savesequim</a> linked to the SearchVoat archive proving that @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=722" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">blumen4alles</a> mentioned @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2399" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">Crensch</a> by name, and despite his defense of SV on here was given a stern warning for doxxing, yet it remains visible in the SV archive. <br><br>

Your continuation to evade this dox report is rather concerning. You are going back on your policy, yes?</div>

You can address the fact that it was a dox by your own standards, complete with multiple sources of proof (your own words), and explain how that doesn't violate your custom definition of dox. 
</div></blockquote>

Which dox - the b4a dox here that I disallowed, or the mention on tlolocaust?
</div></blockquote>

Why don't you enforce your own rule? Now that's a pretty simple question. Go back to reading people's private messages.
</div></blockquote>

Sounds like you're talking about the second one then.  Why be so obtuse?<br><br>
As I said to @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2839" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">MadWorld</a> in chat earlier, yes to be consistent I should probably block the link to the tloloc.  Or allow doxing outright.<br><br>
The options as I see them are these:<br><br>
1. Allow doxing without limitation.  Everyone's responsible for their own opsec.<br><br>
2. Allow "self-doxing" without limitation, but ban non-self-doxing, i.e. the common rule elsewhere.  Then it depends on your definition of "self dox".  If someone's revealed the info by mistake, you seem to think that's a self-dox and fair game.  In which case, why ban doxxing at all?  Let people be responsible for their own opsec.<br><br>
3. Ban doxxing here, but allow links to doxes elsewhere e.g. the tloloc link, links to SV archive, catbox etc.  I'm inclined to think it's different whether the info is displayed here explicitly (e.g. as text or embedded image) or you have to follow the link to find it (e.g. tloloc, SV archive).  But in reality a link here that says "follow this link for dox on [username]..." might as well be explicit.<br><br>
4. Ban doxxing here and links to doxes elsewhere.  Very hard to police (I can imagine a link to a google search which shows someone's dox at the bottom of the page, or on page 2).  Would ban some links to SV archive (which, by the way, I see as separate from SVF and obviously not subject to the same rules) and other sites.  It comes down to what "hosting information" means.  We know SVF would be in trouble for "hosting CP" even if it was just a link to a catbox image.<br><br>
That's where I am currently.  If you want to contribute to this discussion I would encourage you to do it sensibly, civilly and helpfully.  Right now you're being even more of a dick than I am.  But if it helps you feel good about yourself to carry on like that then go for it.</div>

Oh, make no mistake I had no doubt you snoop through everyone's shit - but we just had a problem with Arete and the admin betraying the userbase's trust via data privacy breaching. ConPro at least has a disclaimer before you send a PM that it isn't private. This is some shady shit you're up to, you act like it's a functionality problem when you're the one that went looking. So, here we are, <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">ONCE AGAIN YOU BETRAYED YOUR USERBASE</span></span></strong> and you have the balls to call me paranoid, and all kinds of other ad hominems to deflect from your fuckery.</div>

You can address the fact that it was a dox by your own standards, complete with multiple sources of proof (your own words), and explain how that doesn't violate your custom definition of dox. 
</div></blockquote>

Which dox - the b4a dox here that I disallowed, or the mention on tlolocaust?

Why don't you enforce your own rule? Now that's a pretty simple question. Go back to reading people's private messages.
</div></blockquote>

Sounds like you're talking about the second one then.  Why be so obtuse?<br><br>
As I said to @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2839" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">MadWorld</a> in chat earlier, yes to be consistent I should probably block the link to the tloloc.  Or allow doxing outright.<br><br>
The options as I see them are these:<br><br>
1. Allow doxing without limitation.  Everyone's responsible for their own opsec.<br><br>
2. Allow "self-doxing" without limitation, but ban non-self-doxing, i.e. the common rule elsewhere.  Then it depends on your definition of "self dox".  If someone's revealed the info by mistake, you seem to think that's a self-dox and fair game.  In which case, why ban doxxing at all?  Let people be responsible for their own opsec.<br><br>
3. Ban doxxing here, but allow links to doxes elsewhere e.g. the tloloc link, links to SV archive, catbox etc.  I'm inclined to think it's different whether the info is displayed here explicitly (e.g. as text or embedded image) or you have to follow the link to find it (e.g. tloloc, SV archive).  But in reality a link here that says "follow this link for dox on [username]..." might as well be explicit.<br><br>
4. Ban doxxing here and links to doxes elsewhere.  Very hard to police (I can imagine a link to a google search which shows someone's dox at the bottom of the page, or on page 2).  Would ban some links to SV archive (which, by the way, I see as separate from SVF and obviously not subject to the same rules) and other sites.  It comes down to what "hosting information" means.  We know SVF would be in trouble for "hosting CP" even if it was just a link to a catbox image.<br><br>
That's where I am currently.  If you want to contribute to this discussion I would encourage you to do it sensibly, civilly and helpfully.  Right now you're being even more of a dick than I am.  But if it helps you feel good about yourself to carry on like that then go for it.
</div></blockquote>

I just cut through your bullshit. You're full of shit by calling it a dox because it's based off of his own submissions. This you putting wheels on the goalposts. I posted all your own words specifying that it's a violation to link to <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">any personal information regarding a user's real identity </span></strong> and you're dancing with the stars trying to avoid answering for it. Now you're onto arguing semantics. This isn't helping your case playing games. You're proving me right with every dodge, every troll bot (flair), every ban, and every ad hominem you muster up. <br><br>
Face it. You were wrong to move the goalposts and that's why you're playing hot potato trying to answer for it. Why is it though, before April this drama was non existent on here? <img alt="🤔" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f914.svg"></div>

Thanks for posting that, I mean it.  It's an important issue that most people probably don't think about.  You and @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1709" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">kestrel9</a> obviously didn't for a while.<br><br>

Oh, make no mistake I had no doubt you snoop through everyone's shit - but we just had a problem with Arete and the admin betraying the userbase's trust via data privacy breaching. ConPro at least has a disclaimer before you send a PM that it isn't private. This is some shady shit you're up to, you act like it's a functionality problem when you're the one that went looking. So, here we are, <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">ONCE AGAIN YOU BETRAYED YOUR USERBASE</span></span></strong> and you have the balls to call me paranoid, and all kinds of other ad hominems to deflect from your fuckery.

I kind of expect that shit to happen. But had not come to mind on SVF before this drama. An E2EE would be nice, but that is not the root of problem(s). The main problem lies in the integrity of a site's admin. Voat.co never had this problem, as far as I could tell, and it did not have any encryption for PM. I never heard of Putt snooping at PMs because he could. For what it was worth, Putt got a lot of shit thrown at him, just for looking up downvoaters in his submission. When SV said E2EE would remove his <strong class="text-strong">temptation</strong> to read user's PMs, what would stop him from looking up other private details because of his temptation? What could go wrong with a self-declared dictator, if you will, driven by temptation, to do things because he can and not because they are right or wrong or violating a certain principle? A site's admin can operate in god mode at will. There is no amount of encryption that can fix privacy issue with an admin who wants to look up user's private details.<br><br>
Principles!! What a funny word. SV spoke of upholding his personal principles. He would not bend to violate his own principles. I just hope that looking up PMs, because he can, is not one of them, and that it was a bad joke gone wrong.</div>

Principles!! What a funny word. SV spoke of upholding his personal principles. He would not bend to violate his own principles. I just hope that looking up PMs, because he can, is not one of them, and that it was a bad joke gone wrong.

Oh hold on now, principles is what he says stops him from "giving me the flick" altogether! So he's got some! (coughs-notfromAnnouncementstho-coughs)<br><br>
Edit: You're going to have to stick to one point at a time, it's too boring to respond to!</div>

I'm already on record of supporting this. It actually aligns with the 1st Amendment, and it's the simplest policy. But it doesn't really matter -- you're rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic at this point.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If you want to contribute to this discussion I would encourage you to do it sensibly, civilly and helpfully.

</div></blockquote>

Dude, you went from defending pedo (((blumen))) out of principle (which I actually have no problem with, as I do believe in principles) to banning blumen for posting a harmless video of a child with a horse, as I understand it, after you lose one of the few remaining members. Then you ban ALS from Announcements (something AOU did to me when I criticized his shitty policies), to attaching "flair" to ALS's chat (AOU infamous for attaching "flair" to users), to READING PERSONAL MESSAGES.<br><br>
At this point, I'm only here for the drama. The forum itself is dead, and its been obvious to me for some time that admins are always the weak points in "free speech" sites. Only decentralized forums where users decide what they see can be a true free speech forum.</div>

Yeah I'm leaning that way as well.<br><blockquote cite="./viewtopic.php?p=30242#p30242"><div><cite><a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1484">chrimony</a> wrote: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=30242#p30242" data-post-id="30242" onclick="if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash">↑</a><span class="responsive-hide">Sat Sep 17, 2022 9:42 pm</span></cite>

Yes I agree 100% about admins being the weak point.<br><br>
Through all of this I have been trying to address that weakness, by struggling to develop rules relatively free from the personal bias of the individual, and by revealing everything about my throught processes as I operate here.  Disclosing that I have viewed PMs (have been entirely uninterested in them until the drama of the last couple of weeks, by the way - but the fact remains that they are not "private" to an admin) was a choice based on that principle of openness.  But I fully understand that many people will see <em class="text-italics">disclosing</em> that breach of trust as worse than doing it secretly, which I'm sure is common on sites like this.<br><br>
(btw the site is not dead - just resting)</div>

But it doesn't really matter -- you're rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic at this point.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If you want to contribute to this discussion I would encourage you to do it sensibly, civilly and helpfully.  Right now you're being even more of a dick than I am.
</div></blockquote>

Dude, you went from defending pedo (((blumen))) out of principle (which I actually have no problem with, as I do believe in principles) to banning blumen for posting a harmless video of a child with a horse, as I understand it, after you lose one of the few remaining members. Then you ban ALS from Announcements (something AOU did to me when I criticized his shitty policies), to attaching "flair" to ALS's chat (AOU infamous for attaching "flair" to users), to READING PERSONAL MESSAGES.<br><br>
At this point, I'm only here for the drama. The forum itself is dead, and its been obvious to me for some time that admins are always the weak points in "free speech" sites. Only decentralized forums where users decide what they see can be a true free speech forum.
</div></blockquote>

From your comment on talk.loli: <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>[ - ] chrimony 5 points 1 day ago (+5/-0)<br><br>
" He only sticks around to drive remaining users away &amp; taunt you until you ban him from the site completely so he can cry about it."<br><br><br>
"remaining users" is right. What you don't mention is that CognitiveDissident5, one of the few hardcore members of the forum, deleted their account after you were protected from being "doxxed" when you self-doxxed yourself on another site. The SearchVoat admin threatened to ban anybody that exposed (((you))).<br><br>
After essentially collapsing the forum to protect you, in a hail mary the admin suddenly sees the light and you get the ban. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Now the only content left is the usual ALS drum beat. You and ALS are two sides of the same coin. Both forum destroyers.</span></strong></div></blockquote> Why do you equate me to that pedophile? I'm not the one destroying the boards, I'm the one pointing out the shit that will lead to its demise. You're blaming the messenger.</div>

At this point, I'm only here for the drama. The forum itself is dead, and its been obvious to me for some time that admins are always the weak points in "free speech" sites. Only decentralized forums where users decide what they see can be a true free speech forum.
</div></blockquote>

Yes I agree 100% about admins being the weak point.<br><br>
Through all of this I have been trying to address that weakness, by struggling to develop rules relatively free from the personal bias of the individual, and by revealing everything about my throught processes as I operate here.  Disclosing that I have viewed PMs (have been entirely uninterested in them until the drama of the last couple of weeks, by the way - but the fact remains that they are not "private" to an admin) was a choice based on that principle of openness.  But I fully understand that many people will see <em class="text-italics">disclosing</em> that breach of trust as worse than doing it secretly, which I'm sure is common on sites like this.<br><br>
(btw the site is not dead - just resting)

Because you take your crusading to extreme levels. blumen is willing to tear down a forum by prancing on the line of banning, and you're willing to go to war against admins and users if they aren't willing to ban guys like blumen. You've made enemies of even people who used to be your allies.</div>

But I fully understand that many people will see <em class="text-italics">disclosing</em> that breach of trust as worse than doing it secretly, which I'm sure is common on sites like this.
</div></blockquote>

I commend you for disclosing what you did. But it doesn't absolve you of the consequences -- which, in this case, is just public opinion.</div>

Why do you equate me to that pedophile? I'm not the one destroying the boards, I'm the one pointing out the shit that will lead to its demise. You're blaming the messenger.
</div></blockquote>

Because you take your crusading to extreme levels. blumen is willing to tear down a forum by prancing on the line of banning, and you're willing to go to war against admins and users if they aren't willing to ban guys like blumen. You've made enemies of even people who used to be your allies.
</div></blockquote>

Anyone willing to protect Weimar shit is no ally. I go to war to expose the truth when they get up to dirty shit that undermines what free speech, and freedom as a whole stands for. I see shit before anyone else does, and I put a name on it. You think it's an accident people know Blume's a pedo, and TexasVet is a fraud? You think it's an accident the Ruqqus admins pulled a shoah right as I said they would?<br><br>
I never once called for Blume's ban - only pedo shit. If that causes a meltdown in the admin/userbase relationship - the problem is a lot bigger than I am. Anyone with a fucking conscience should know that.</div>

I'm already on record of supporting this. It actually aligns with the 1st Amendment, and it's the simplest policy.

Yeah I'm leaning that way as well.

When you say "tweets" do mean literally on twitter, or do you mean posts here?
</div></blockquote>

Literally on Twitter, I want to do a thread about a psy-op/Larp that occurred on voat/Twitter. Tangentially, this LARP was boosted by Voat users on twitter/youtube including a user who was involved in planning J6 and worked with flynn.<br><br>
While much media coverage has gone into this user, their voat participation has not been discovered (though they regularly cross promoted themselves by linking to their other social media sites from their voat acct).<br><br>
If I were to do this thread, one tweet would tangentially dox this user.<br><br>
Theoretically could that whole thread not be cross posted, or just the one tweet that included the dox?</div>

A thread here that links to a thread on Twitter, if I understand correctly. If I allow an external link to tlolc where a SVF user was doxed, why not allow an external link to Twitter that does the same thing? Yes?</div>

Are you planning on having the thread on twitter?<br><br>
EDIT: I ask because I'm wondering if what you post ends up putting will put a huge target on this site.  The political climate of zero tolerance is now an organized and well-funded crusade.  <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262</a> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264</a> <a href="https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/tranny-activist-behind-latest-push-to-shut-down-internet-nbc-news-ben-collins-keffals-kiwifarms/" class="postlink">https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/trann ... kiwifarms/</a></div>

Literally on Twitter, I want to do a thread about a psy-op/Larp that occurred on voat/Twitter. Tangentially, this LARP was boosted by Voat users on twitter/youtube including a user who was involved in planning J6 and worked with flynn.<br><br>
While much media coverage has gone into this user, their voat participation has not been discovered (though they regularly cross promoted themselves by linking to their other social media sites from their voat acct).<br><br>
If I were to do this thread, one tweet would tangentially dox this user.<br><br>
Theoretically could that whole thread not be cross posted, or just the one tweet that included the dox?

A thread here that links to a thread on Twitter, if I understand correctly. If I allow an external link to tlolc where a SVF user was doxed, why not allow an external link to Twitter that does the same thing? Yes?

Exactly, could I post a link to the thread? Could I post links to subtweets within that thread? Could I post links to the source material on SV Archive? Where is the line drawn?</div>

When you say "tweets" do mean literally on twitter, or do you mean posts here?
</div></blockquote>

Literally on Twitter, I want to do a thread about a psy-op/Larp that occurred on voat/Twitter. Tangentially, this LARP was boosted by Voat users on twitter/youtube including a user who was involved in planning J6 and worked with flynn.<br><br>
While much media coverage has gone into this user, their voat participation has not been discovered (though they regularly cross promoted themselves by linking to their other social media sites from their voat acct).<br><br>
If I were to do this thread, one tweet would tangentially dox this user.<br><br>
Theoretically could that whole thread not be cross posted, or just the one tweet that included the dox?
</div></blockquote>

Are you planning on having the thread on twitter?<br><br>
EDIT: I ask because I'm wondering if what you post ends up putting will put a huge target on this site.  The political climate of zero tolerance is now an organized and well-funded crusade.  <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262</a> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264</a> <a href="https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/tranny-activist-behind-latest-push-to-shut-down-internet-nbc-news-ben-collins-keffals-kiwifarms/" class="postlink">https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/trann ... kiwifarms/</a>
</div></blockquote>

I've been thinking about that too as I'm not seeking to bring untoward attention to svf. I think I could phrase it in such a way that I call "SV an archive of the now defunct Voat" without mentioning SVF</div>

The position of that line is exactly what I'm struggling with atm in e.g. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=30216#p30216" class="postlink">this post</a>.<br><br>
I also think this is a major issue...

...right now with respect to KWF.<br><br>
(thinking)<br><br>
Hmm on balance I think I'm going to have to delete that link to tlolc and risk interpreting the anti-dox rule too broadly, rather than allowing the tlolc and your link and risk interpreting the rule too narrowly, or abolish it entirely.  Not ready to take that step yet.<br><br>
Sorry. I can imagine how enthusiastic you are about posting this.  It will have to stay on other sites for now.<br><br>

A thread here that links to a thread on Twitter, if I understand correctly. If I allow an external link to tlolc where a SVF user was doxed, why not allow an external link to Twitter that does the same thing? Yes?
</div></blockquote>

Exactly, could I post a link to the thread? Could I post links to subtweets within that thread? Could I post links to the source material on SV Archive? Where is the line drawn?
</div></blockquote>

The position of that line is exactly what I'm struggling with atm in e.g. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=30216#p30216" class="postlink">this post</a>.<br><br>
I also think this is a major issue...

I ask because I'm wondering if what you post ends up putting will put a huge target on this site.  The political climate of zero tolerance is now an organized and well-funded crusade.  <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262</a> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264</a> <a href="https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/tranny-activist-behind-latest-push-to-shut-down-internet-nbc-news-ben-collins-keffals-kiwifarms/" class="postlink">https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/trann ... kiwifarms/</a>
</div></blockquote>
...right now with respect to KWF.<br><br>
(thinking)<br><br>
Hmm on balance I think I'm going to have to delete that link to tlolc and risk interpreting the anti-dox rule too broadly, rather than allowing the tlolc and your link and risk interpreting the rule too narrowly, or abolish it entirely.  Not ready to take that step yet.<br><br>
Sorry. I can imagine how enthusiastic you are about posting this.  It will have to stay on other sites for now.<br><br>
Edit: remove personal info
</div></blockquote>

Bums me out, but I appreciate your attempts to keep rule implementation consistent. Hope it changes someday</div>

Literally on Twitter, I want to do a thread about a psy-op/Larp that occurred on voat/Twitter. Tangentially, this LARP was boosted by Voat users on twitter/youtube including a user who was involved in planning J6 and worked with flynn.<br><br>
While much media coverage has gone into this user, their voat participation has not been discovered (though they regularly cross promoted themselves by linking to their other social media sites from their voat acct).<br><br>
If I were to do this thread, one tweet would tangentially dox this user.<br><br>
Theoretically could that whole thread not be cross posted, or just the one tweet that included the dox?
</div></blockquote>

Are you planning on having the thread on twitter?<br><br>
EDIT: I ask because I'm wondering if what you post ends up putting will put a huge target on this site.  The political climate of zero tolerance is now an organized and well-funded crusade.  <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262</a> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264</a> <a href="https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/tranny-activist-behind-latest-push-to-shut-down-internet-nbc-news-ben-collins-keffals-kiwifarms/" class="postlink">https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/trann ... kiwifarms/</a>
</div></blockquote>

I've been thinking about that too as I'm not seeking to bring untoward attention to svf. I think I could phrase it in such a way that I call "SV an archive of the now defunct Voat" without mentioning SVF
</div></blockquote>

Dude: <em class="text-italics"> "Literally on Twitter, I want to do a thread about a psy-op/Larp that occurred on voat/Twitter. Tangentially, this LARP was boosted by Voat users on twitter/youtube including a user who was involved in planning J6 and worked with flynn.<br><br>

Inadvertently linking to an old dox would be the least of the problem. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>...I don’t think this has ever happened before,” one longtime cybersecurity expert told Revolver. “If IP addresses can be revoked, then the people who control them basically control the Internet and what is allowed on it.”<br><br>
More broadly, the expert said, the strategy used on KiwiFarms has provided a a template that can be recreated over and over again.<br><br>
“If somebody can mount a political attack to get IP allocations canceled, DDOS canceled, hosting canceled, and so on, it becomes very very difficult to operate anything outside the prescribed of acceptable behaviors,” he said.</div></blockquote>

The perfect storm really is more about the "J6 and worked with flynn" part of it.  No doubt everything related to that story you are thinking of amplifying has been combed through before but now current political climate with elections looming, the agenda is to take everything in a scorched earth approach, burn it all down.  This is imho.  What SV thinks or decides about rules here will be irrelevant if that scenario were to happen. Activists are getting <em class="text-italics">paid to find users/sites</em> to build a public case justifying the revoking of IP addresses, just over free speech on trans issues alone. Think about it.</div>

Are you planning on having the thread on twitter?<br><br>
EDIT: I ask because I'm wondering if what you post ends up putting will put a huge target on this site.  The political climate of zero tolerance is now an organized and well-funded crusade.  <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10262</a> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=10264</a> <a href="https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/tranny-activist-behind-latest-push-to-shut-down-internet-nbc-news-ben-collins-keffals-kiwifarms/" class="postlink">https://www.revolver.news/2022/09/trann ... kiwifarms/</a>
</div></blockquote>

I've been thinking about that too as I'm not seeking to bring untoward attention to svf. I think I could phrase it in such a way that I call "SV an archive of the now defunct Voat" without mentioning SVF

Dude: <em class="text-italics"> "Literally on Twitter, I want to do a thread about a psy-op/Larp that occurred on voat/Twitter. Tangentially, this LARP was boosted by Voat users on twitter/youtube including a user who was involved in planning J6 and worked with flynn.<br><br>

The perfect storm really is more about the "J6 and worked with flynn" part of it.  No doubt everything related to that story you are thinking of amplifying has been combed through before but now current political climate with elections looming, the agenda is to take everything in a scorched earth approach, burn it all down.

</div></blockquote>

It's a tough issue. I don't endorse those mvmts/actions. At the same time, I also think the J6 trial is the best opportunity that exists to mainstream internet activities/influence ops and make the average person aware of how manipulated they are. I despise the modern right as much as the modern left. Both seek to psychologically rape for ctrl. <br><br>
I disagree that all of these avenues have been explored however re: J6 planners/organizers. The average journalist is stifled by their limited perspective and reliance upon mainstream sources. While I appreciate what voat was, I still have many questions about how it was operated and funded. Free speech is one issue, transparency and data analytics are another. <br><br>
Do you not think these trails should be followed?</div>

It's a tough issue. I don't endorse those mvmts/actions. At the same time, I also think the J6 trial is the best opportunity that exists to mainstream internet activities/influence ops and make the average person aware of how manipulated they are. I despise the modern right as much as the modern left. Both seek to psychologically rape for ctrl. <br><br>
I disagree that all of these avenues have been explored however re: J6 planners/organizers. The average journalist is stifled by their limited perspective and reliance upon mainstream sources. While I appreciate what voat was, I still have many questions about how it was operated and funded. Free speech is one issue, transparency and data analytics are another. <br><br>
Do you not think these trails should be followed?

If you insist on putting this site at risk, then at least use screen shots only of the Voat material you are including, the live link to SVF is right on SV page.
</div></blockquote>

Good thought. As I value the resource and don't want it going anywhere, I'll do just that
