<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Vigilante groups such as Dark Justice command massive support online<br>
Mother-of-three Gemma posed as 13-year-old for Huntz 2 Exposure group<br>
But the group's 'head of security' was in fact a ‘dangerous sexual predator’</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5876149/Disturbing-truth-Britains-growing-army-self-appointed-paedophile-hunters.html" class="postlink">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/articl ... nters.html</a><br><br>
Gemma Cowell was a young mom who volunteered to help the group.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>‘It felt like a public service,’ says Gemma. ‘I’d be doing my bit to protect children and make the world a better, cleaner place. <br><br>
'I had a personal reason for wanting to bring paedophiles to justice too: I was seriously sexually assaulted when I was 16 by a 22-year-old man who was never charged.’<br><br>
When she signed up with the group Huntz 2 Exposure this year, after seeing footage of a ‘sting’ on Facebook, Gemma joined a growing army of amateur paedophile hunters whose operations stretch across the UK. <br><br>
The nation is in the grip of an extraordinary phenomenon involving possibly thousands of have-a-go investigators.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>They have formed a volunteer online taskforce, linked by Facebook groups and private mobile phone chat groups.<br><br>
Videos of stings — some broadcast live — are viewed by thousands, with ringleaders treated like minor celebs.<br><br>
Last year their evidence was used to charge more than 150 suspects, a seven-fold increase in two years.<br><br>
So, an honourable and altruistic role...yet after a month, Gemma was still waiting for a single approach from someone displaying an interest in sex with children.<br><br>
Instead, she was becoming concerned about the behaviour of her fellow hunters. <br><br>
Admitted to their private message groups, where around 20 of them ‘chatted’ using online aliases, she looked on in horror as they appeared to treat their activities as a sick game.<br><br>
They mocked innocent people, sometimes obviously mentally ill, egged each other on and openly admitted they were desperate for a ‘result’. </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Some fantasised about ‘slicing and dicing’ offenders, while another bragged she ‘wouldn’t stop until she saw blood’.<br><br>
And instead of intercepting organised grooming gangs in the act, they seemed to be entrapping vulnerable men with premeditated, sexually-loaded questions Gemma wasn’t comfortable with.<br><br>
The stings themselves seemed to do more harm than good. <br><br>
‘Families are often attacked, children are bullied or their houses smashed up. They seemed to be putting children and families at risk rather than protecting them,’ she said.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0000">The final straw came when a leading member was exposed by a rival group as a predatory paedophile himself, throwing the group into chaos. <br><br>
That’s when Gemma decided she’d had enough and announced she was leaving.<br><br>
Retribution was brutal and swift. <br><br>
‘They turned on me. They said I couldn’t be trusted and called me a “nonce sympathiser”. <br><br>
'They took photos of my children from Facebook, posted them on the group chat and mocked them. They threatened to come to my home.</span></div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

‘Yet they say they want to protect children? You have a group here who try to play God. They are taking the law into their own hands. <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>'They even welcomed a convicted paedophile into their ranks without checking his credentials. It made me wonder who else is working for them, and why.’</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>‘It also seemed inappropriate — we were told to be naive. But what 13-year-old would ask “what does sex mean” or “what is a b*** j**?”<br><br>
‘The questions were very specific and designed to get incriminating answers. The decoys worked in such a way as to trap the person into giving an answer.’<br><br>
Gemma also noticed a pattern in the type of men who caught the attention of the hunters: fat, old, hairy ‘dodgy-looking’ men, non-native English speakers and those from overseas who wouldn’t be familiar with our culture.<br><br>
‘To me they seemed to target those you might think “look” like a paedophile. <br><br>
'Younger-looking men were instantly dismissed. In some conversations, it wasn’t clear if there was a language barrier or the target had learning disabilities.<br>
‘One guy I spoke to was clearly autistic. Some were not even capable of looking after themselves, let alone arranging to travel somewhere for sex with a child.’<br>
As one ‘hunter’ complained: ‘I’ve got one who’s obsessed with tickling . . . another who’s been speaking to me for ages, but not in a sexual way. I think one of them is one sandwich short of a picnic — he keeps telling me he’s my best friend.’ <br>
Another griped she was talking to one ‘who just wants to be my big brother and take care of me. Doesn’t want to f*** me and it’s getting very frustrating.’<br><br>
A month after she joined, the group was thrown into chaos when a leading member of the hunting ‘community’ was exposed as a paedophile. </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Incredibly, Michael Terry had infiltrated a linked group, The Guardian Angels, and had won the trust of Huntz 2 Exposure, setting himself up as the group’s ‘head of security’. This was despite the fact he’d been described as a ‘dangerous sexual predator’ by a judge.<br><br>
He had been convicted at Liverpool Crown Court in 2014 of indecent exposure and inciting a girl under 16 to engage in a sexual act and given a five-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order.  It prevented him from having any contact with children under 16.<br><br>
Then, in February 2016, he was jailed for 12 months at Preston Crown Court when he breached the order by befriending a vulnerable woman who had a six-year-old son and staying overnight with them in Blackpool.<br><br>
Terry, 43, breached the order again after he joined the Lincolnshire-based Guardian Angels, and became close to its director Mandy Bradley — staying over at her house on several occasions, despite her having three children under 13.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He was eventually caught after a police request to Mrs Bradley to check his background.<br><br>
After she uncovered his paedophile past he was arrested and finally jailed for 20 months at Lincoln Crown Court in March this year.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0000"><em class="text-italics">It was quite an own goal, and in the aftermath a deeply embarrassed Huntz 2 Exposure privately called on everyone to demonstrate they did not have a similar criminal record.<br><br>
Gemma watched in horror as the confessions started pouring in. <br><br>
One of the founders, going by the alias of Matt Huntz, didn’t even seem remotely ashamed, admitting: ‘I’ve got a criminal record as long as my f***ing street. I’ve been arrested more times than I’ve eaten hot meals.’<br><br>
He went on to say he had convictions for intent to supply and wounding with intent.</em></span></div></blockquote>

One woman said: ‘I’ve only been detained twice under the Mental Health Act. Both times was not my fault, down to ex partners.’<br><br>
Gemma began to doubt whether these people were best qualified to be safeguarding children.<br><br>
Professor Liz Yardley, a criminologist at Birmingham City University agrees.  She said she suspects that, far from being motivated by a need to help children, the hunters are really ‘doing it for themselves’. <br><br>
She said: ‘It is incredible how some online groups are able to justify some of the most horrendous behaviour.<br><br>
‘Child sexual exploitation is obviously a very serious crime but they would be better getting behind the legitimate campaigns of the NSPCC and others.<br><br>
‘It is interesting to look at the kind of people involved in this. They are not high-achieving professionals with fulfilling family lives and careers.<br><br>
‘They are people looking for opportunities to be “somebody” and become “something” and this defines them.’<br><br>
Last night Amy Kidley, a 28-year-old single mother who co-founded Huntz 2 Exposure a year ago, defended the group’s actions.<br><br>
Amy, now based in West Yorkshire, dismissed Gemma’s allegations that she had been threatened as ‘a load of c***’, before adding: ‘We are here to do this for the kids, that is our priority.<br><br>
‘We have decoys working tirelessly outside of school hours and waiting for these predators to approach them. </div></blockquote></div>

That's why I'm very worried about the possibility that ALS is an active pedophile himself. I'm not playing games here. If I'm right, there are children being ruined by this guy right now.</div>

Yep. It's exactly the pattern ALS displays.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The final straw came when a leading member was exposed by a rival group as a predatory paedophile himself, throwing the group into chaos.
</div></blockquote>

That's why I'm very worried about the possibility that ALS is an active pedophile himself. I'm not playing games here. If I'm right, there are children being ruined by this guy right now.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Vigilante groups such as Dark Justice command massive support online<br>
Mother-of-three Gemma posed as 13-year-old for Huntz 2 Exposure group<br>
But the group's 'head of security' was in fact a ‘dangerous sexual predator’</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5876149/Disturbing-truth-Britains-growing-army-self-appointed-paedophile-hunters.html" class="postlink">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/articl ... nters.html</a><br><br>
Gemma Cowell was a young mom who volunteered to help the group.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>‘It felt like a public service,’ says Gemma. ‘I’d be doing my bit to protect children and make the world a better, cleaner place. <br><br>
'I had a personal reason for wanting to bring paedophiles to justice too: I was seriously sexually assaulted when I was 16 by a 22-year-old man who was never charged.’<br><br>
When she signed up with the group Huntz 2 Exposure this year, after seeing footage of a ‘sting’ on Facebook, Gemma joined a growing army of amateur paedophile hunters whose operations stretch across the UK. <br><br>
The nation is in the grip of an extraordinary phenomenon involving possibly thousands of have-a-go investigators.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>They have formed a volunteer online taskforce, linked by Facebook groups and private mobile phone chat groups.<br><br>
Videos of stings — some broadcast live — are viewed by thousands, with ringleaders treated like minor celebs.<br><br>
Last year their evidence was used to charge more than 150 suspects, a seven-fold increase in two years.<br><br>
So, an honourable and altruistic role...yet after a month, Gemma was still waiting for a single approach from someone displaying an interest in sex with children.<br><br>
Instead, she was becoming concerned about the behaviour of her fellow hunters. <br><br>
Admitted to their private message groups, where around 20 of them ‘chatted’ using online aliases, she looked on in horror as they appeared to treat their activities as a sick game.<br><br>
They mocked innocent people, sometimes obviously mentally ill, egged each other on and openly admitted they were desperate for a ‘result’. </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Some fantasised about ‘slicing and dicing’ offenders, while another bragged she ‘wouldn’t stop until she saw blood’.<br><br>
And instead of intercepting organised grooming gangs in the act, they seemed to be entrapping vulnerable men with premeditated, sexually-loaded questions Gemma wasn’t comfortable with.<br><br>
The stings themselves seemed to do more harm than good. <br><br>
‘Families are often attacked, children are bullied or their houses smashed up. They seemed to be putting children and families at risk rather than protecting them,’ she said.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0000">The final straw came when a leading member was exposed by a rival group as a predatory paedophile himself, throwing the group into chaos. <br><br>
That’s when Gemma decided she’d had enough and announced she was leaving.<br><br>
Retribution was brutal and swift. <br><br>
‘They turned on me. They said I couldn’t be trusted and called me a “nonce sympathiser”. <br><br>
'They took photos of my children from Facebook, posted them on the group chat and mocked them. They threatened to come to my home.</span></div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

‘Yet they say they want to protect children? You have a group here who try to play God. They are taking the law into their own hands. <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>'They even welcomed a convicted paedophile into their ranks without checking his credentials. It made me wonder who else is working for them, and why.’</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>‘It also seemed inappropriate — we were told to be naive. But what 13-year-old would ask “what does sex mean” or “what is a b*** j**?”<br><br>
‘The questions were very specific and designed to get incriminating answers. The decoys worked in such a way as to trap the person into giving an answer.’<br><br>
Gemma also noticed a pattern in the type of men who caught the attention of the hunters: fat, old, hairy ‘dodgy-looking’ men, non-native English speakers and those from overseas who wouldn’t be familiar with our culture.<br><br>
‘To me they seemed to target those you might think “look” like a paedophile. <br><br>
'Younger-looking men were instantly dismissed. In some conversations, it wasn’t clear if there was a language barrier or the target had learning disabilities.<br>
‘One guy I spoke to was clearly autistic. Some were not even capable of looking after themselves, let alone arranging to travel somewhere for sex with a child.’<br>
As one ‘hunter’ complained: ‘I’ve got one who’s obsessed with tickling . . . another who’s been speaking to me for ages, but not in a sexual way. I think one of them is one sandwich short of a picnic — he keeps telling me he’s my best friend.’ <br>
Another griped she was talking to one ‘who just wants to be my big brother and take care of me. Doesn’t want to f*** me and it’s getting very frustrating.’<br><br>
A month after she joined, the group was thrown into chaos when a leading member of the hunting ‘community’ was exposed as a paedophile. </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Incredibly, Michael Terry had infiltrated a linked group, The Guardian Angels, and had won the trust of Huntz 2 Exposure, setting himself up as the group’s ‘head of security’. This was despite the fact he’d been described as a ‘dangerous sexual predator’ by a judge.<br><br>
He had been convicted at Liverpool Crown Court in 2014 of indecent exposure and inciting a girl under 16 to engage in a sexual act and given a five-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order.  It prevented him from having any contact with children under 16.<br><br>
Then, in February 2016, he was jailed for 12 months at Preston Crown Court when he breached the order by befriending a vulnerable woman who had a six-year-old son and staying overnight with them in Blackpool.<br><br>
Terry, 43, breached the order again after he joined the Lincolnshire-based Guardian Angels, and became close to its director Mandy Bradley — staying over at her house on several occasions, despite her having three children under 13.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He was eventually caught after a police request to Mrs Bradley to check his background.<br><br>
After she uncovered his paedophile past he was arrested and finally jailed for 20 months at Lincoln Crown Court in March this year.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0000"><em class="text-italics">It was quite an own goal, and in the aftermath a deeply embarrassed Huntz 2 Exposure privately called on everyone to demonstrate they did not have a similar criminal record.<br><br>
Gemma watched in horror as the confessions started pouring in. <br><br>
One of the founders, going by the alias of Matt Huntz, didn’t even seem remotely ashamed, admitting: ‘I’ve got a criminal record as long as my f***ing street. I’ve been arrested more times than I’ve eaten hot meals.’<br><br>
He went on to say he had convictions for intent to supply and wounding with intent.</em></span></div></blockquote>

One woman said: ‘I’ve only been detained twice under the Mental Health Act. Both times was not my fault, down to ex partners.’<br><br>
Gemma began to doubt whether these people were best qualified to be safeguarding children.<br><br>
Professor Liz Yardley, a criminologist at Birmingham City University agrees.  She said she suspects that, far from being motivated by a need to help children, the hunters are really ‘doing it for themselves’. <br><br>
She said: ‘It is incredible how some online groups are able to justify some of the most horrendous behaviour.<br><br>
‘Child sexual exploitation is obviously a very serious crime but they would be better getting behind the legitimate campaigns of the NSPCC and others.<br><br>
‘It is interesting to look at the kind of people involved in this. They are not high-achieving professionals with fulfilling family lives and careers.<br><br>
‘They are people looking for opportunities to be “somebody” and become “something” and this defines them.’<br><br>
Last night Amy Kidley, a 28-year-old single mother who co-founded Huntz 2 Exposure a year ago, defended the group’s actions.<br><br>
Amy, now based in West Yorkshire, dismissed Gemma’s allegations that she had been threatened as ‘a load of c***’, before adding: ‘We are here to do this for the kids, that is our priority.<br><br>
‘We have decoys working tirelessly outside of school hours and waiting for these predators to approach them. </div></blockquote>
