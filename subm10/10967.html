<blockquote class="uncited"><div><a href="https://expose-news.com/2023/01/12/ist-of-gov-officials-collaborating-with-wef/" class="postlink">https://expose-news.com/2023/01/12/ist- ... -with-wef/</a></div></blockquote>

This year’s World Economic Forum’s (“WEF”) annual meeting at Davos is being held from 10 to 16 January.  As the Globalists meet, organisers have confirmed the WEF will host 52 heads of state and government and nearly 600 CEOs. <br><br>
Additionally, nearly 300 government ministers are expected to take part.  As well as the heads of state, these government ministers also need to be sacked, stripped of their titles and replaced with people who will serve their country’s citizens.  <br><br>
Citizens who pay their salaries and elect them – assuming a free, fair, transparent and democratic voting system is in use – to govern the country’s affairs on voters’ behalf.<br><br>
Attached at the end of this article is a list of the heads of state and government officials who are misusing and abusing their government positions to collaborate with WEF to further Globalists’ business and other interests.  All of them should be relieved of their duties pending an investigation.<br><br>

WEF is a dangerous force in global politics. WEF is an outfit that proposes to coordinate the reorganisation of 8 billion souls, 195 countries, international relations, social policy writ-large, and a $104 trillion global economy. They are delusional and megalomaniacal.<br><br>
As noted by The Spectator, [1] WEF’s Chairman Klaus Schwab’s core commitment is to political and economic arrangements which, he calls stakeholder capitalism but, used to be known as corporatism. The language of corporatism, like that of Schwab’s WEF, may be one of coordinated consultation, but the agenda is one of control. WEF has decided that the time has come to rearrange the world from the top down and remake the planet in a corporatist image.<br><br>
Corporatism – including its Schwabian expression – isn’t big on freedom. It’s all about forming and then maintaining a consensus on economic and social policies. For this reason, corporatism doesn’t cope well with dissent. Indeed, it discourages any questioning of the consensus, whether the issue is tax-rates or climate change. For what matters is the harmonisation of views, no matter how absurd the idea and or how high the cost in liberty. Not only does this generate groupthink. It encourages the marginalisation of those who dispute the consensus. Another problem is the collusion and cronyism fostered by corporatism. <br><br>
Corporatist-style stakeholder capitalism is decidedly ambivalent about democracy. There’s not much room for contributions from the wider populace to the decision-making process in Schwab’s stakeholder capitalist model, let alone popular assent to decisions taken. Indeed, the model reflects a positive distrust of bottom-up initiatives because these are harder to control and less likely to buy into the established consensus.<br><br>
Accessories to WEF’s Global Conspiracy<br><br>
Since 3 January, WEF has been posting regular tweets boasting about who are some of this year’s delegates.  All WEF members, particularly its leadership, need to be investigated for conspiring against the world.  But we must thank WEF for naming some of those who also need to be investigated and held accountable.  Here is a list of WEF tweets, from the first on 3 January up to 11 January, naming and shaming, from our point of view, some of the accessories to WEF’s global conspiracy:<br><br>

A Few Good Reasons to Distrust WEF Members and their Collaborators<br><br>
Below is a collection of tweets that demonstrate a few of the things WEF and their puppet heads of state and government officials are hoping to achieve, if not now, in the years ahead.

What we are seeing on the modern political left is a new manifestation of two very old ideologies melded into one, said Larry Alex Taunton.  “This defines Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum, environmentalism, etc.” Taunton will be going to Davos next week.  “Barring the unexpected, I’ll be there as your eyes and ears,” he tweeted.<br><br><br>
A list of UK attendees at Davos 2023 – The Expose
<blockquote class="uncited"><div><a href="https://expose-news.com/2023/01/13/a-list-of-uk-attendees-at-davos-2023/" class="postlink">https://expose-news.com/2023/01/13/a-li ... avos-2023/</a></div></blockquote>

Below is a list of UK government officials that we know of so far that are attending the World Economic Forum’s (“WEF”) annual meeting in Davos this week.<br><br>
In 2020, 75 “Head of State” and “Prime Minister” from 54 countries attended WEF’s Davos meeting. In total there were 264 attendees from the UK according to a list published by Quartz.  In 2022, there were 211 people from the UK who attended Davos.

About Davos 2023<br><br>
Deloitte sums up what Davos means to them in one sentence.   Search results for the term “Davos 2023 attendees” brings up the following from Deloitte: “Connecting profit with people and planet.”<br><br><br>
Screenshot of search engine search results, retrieved 12 January 2023<br>
Not surprisingly, Deloitte, in its own words, is “proud to be a long-standing strategic partner of WEF.”  It has daily coverage of Davos on LinkedIn, the titles of which tell a story in themselves. These are the highlights from Davos 2023 that Deloitte will be covering, while reading the titles remember Deloitte sees Davos as “connecting profit with people and planet”:<br><br>
Day 1 – Transformation<br>
Day 2 – Sustainability<br>
Day 3 – Digital Transformation<br>
Day 4 – Future of Work<br>
Day 5 – Davos Full Wrap Up<br>
And Deloitte has its own programme of events at Davos, which have been “inspired by this year’s WEF Annual Meeting theme: Cooperation in a Fragmented World.”  Deloitte’s program of events at Davos 2023 includes:<br><br>
Climate – Accelerating the Green Transition<br>
Climate – Building Sustainability into Organizational Culture and Brand Strategy<br>
Climate – Chair’s Guide to Valuing Nature<br>
Climate – Collaborate to Accelerate: Scaling Climate Tech Innovation to Industry and the levers of Net<br>
Climate – Moving from Strategy to Action: The Importance of Climate Tech<br>
Climate – System Change for a Sustainable World<br>
Climate – The Road to Net-Zero Panel<br>
Technology – #ChangeTheFace Reception<br>
Technology – Cyber: Preparing for a Secure Quantum Transition<br>
Technology – Tech for Good<br>
Affiliate session – Health Equity as an essential component of Stakeholder Capitalism<br>
Spend a few moments thinking about the implications and how, using the events listed above, Deloitte might be attempting to fulfil the objective of “connecting profit with people and planet.”<br><br>
Of the four Davos 2023 delegates from Deloitte, only one is from the United Kingdom: Sharon Thorne, Chair of the Deloitte Global Board of Directors. She is also a member of the A4S Advisory Council, the Social Progress Imperative Board of Directors, the Stewardship Board of the World Economic Forum Platform for Shaping the Future of the New Economy and Society, the Shanghai International Financial Advisory Council, and the 30% Club.<br><br><br>

UK Public Figures at Davos 2023<br><br>
As well as representatives from businesses and charities, UK government officials are also attending Davos 2023.  The Dossier obtained a list of public officials, former and current, who were registered to attend Davos.  Included in that list are UK public officials, see below, who are collaborating with WEF this year at Davos.<br><br>
Zac Goldsmith (Conservative, House of Lords)	Minister of State for the Commonwealth, Overseas Territories, Energy, Climate and the Environment of the United Kingdom	United Kingdom<br>
Nicholas Lyons	Lord Mayor of the City of London, United Kingdom. The City of London, despite its geographical location, is not part of Greater London, the UK or even Europe – it is a sovereign state.	United Kingdom<br>
Rachel Reeves (Labour)	Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, United Kingdom	United Kingdom<br>
Richard Moore	Chief, Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), United Kingdom.  In April 2021, Moore announced that MI6 were recruiting for a head of a new high-tech team. The head of the team would be known as “Q.”	United Kingdom<br>
Tony Blair (Labour)	Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1997-2007); Founder, Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, United Kingdom	United Kingdom<br>
Not included in the list above is current Labour Party leader Kier Starmer who with Rachel Reeves, The Times reported, “will be jetting off … to the World Economic Forum, where they will meet business chiefs, foreign leaders and other international figures. Their attendance at the exclusive event in the Swiss Alps will be used to send a message to the super-rich that Labour is the party of business.”<br><br>
By “business” they mean Big Business, not local UK business and entrepreneurs that supply local needs, create employment and opportunities and grow economies locally.  Because WEF consists of a few selected global corporations who want to own and control more at the expense of local businesses.  It is to these Globalist businesses that Starmer and Reeves are “sending a message” that Labour is the Party for them.<br><br>
If you know of any other UK attendees, please let us know in the comment section, with source links, and we will update our article accordingly.</div>
