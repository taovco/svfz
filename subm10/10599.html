Mark Karpeles, CEO of now defunct Mt. Gox crypto exchange to launch rating service<br><br><em class="text-italics">After a series of unfortunate events turned his life upside down for over five years, Karpeles is now making his way back with UNGOX, which is poised to address the problems everyday investors would face while investing in crypto.</em><br><img src="https://archive.ph/R6mt1/20ef58965e76da45a715d372a097bd4d1cbd7bef.webp" class="postimage" alt="Image"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mark Karpeles, Co-Founder and ex-CEO of the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, recently announced his return to the world of cryptocurrencies with a fresh start-up called UNGOX. This clever christening indicates the undoing of his crypto exchange’s failure and his attempt to protect investor interest. “Following Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy, ‘goxed’ (sometimes written goxxed) has become a synonym of losing cryptocurrencies due to faulty Bitcoin exchange or wallet that screwed up,” said Mark in an interview with Forkast where he announced his latest endeavour.<br><br>
After a series of unfortunate events turned his life upside down for over five years, Karpeles is now making his way back with UNGOX, which is poised to address the problems everyday investors would face while investing in crypto. According to Karpeles’s interview statements, UNGOX will position itself as a rating agency for crypto firms and evaluate four aspects of every entity: technology deployed, transparency maintained, people, and legal context.<br><br>
This comes after his long legal battle with the Japanese judiciary, from which he emerged victoriously in 2019. But cut back to July 2010, and Mt. Gox had just commenced operations, quickly becoming the largest crypto exchange of its time. However, it was forced to shut down in February 2014 after a massive hack rendered it bankrupt. At its peak, it managed 80 percent of the global Bitcoin trading volume and held 850,000 BTC that went missing after the hack. Fortunately, 200,000 BTC worth ~$6 billion were retrieved by Karpeles later on and are likely to be used to return investors’ funds.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Despite all the security protocols of blockchain technology, the crypto industry remains vulnerable to hacks and cyber theft. The latest one in a long series of cyberattacks is the Axie Infinity fiasco on March 23, 2022, wherein hackers siphoned off $615 million worth of cryptocurrency from the online game’s platform. It is one of the largest attacks ever observed in the world of crypto.<br><br>
“After the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, I have been following the developments in the crypto space, and I have seen some exchanges taking steps to prevent a second Mt. Gox. For instance, by implementing transparency reports. Despite this, the trend died down very quickly, and today’s situation for many exchanges is very similar to what led to Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy,” Karpeles told Forkast. But that’s not the end of the line for UNGOX — there are other problems that the platform will try to address.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paul Wasensteiner, a Mt. Gox creditor, told CCN.com that creditors were not made aware that their claims were limited to a maximum value of $480 and that the bankruptcy would settle the proceedings based on the price of bitcoin three years ago. Creditors have expressed their concerns over the process of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, and the possibility that Karpeles, who is directly responsible for the loss of $7 billion in funds, might take away $859 million from the $1.3 billion that has been recovered.<br><br>
Consequently, subsequent to the completion of the payout of Mt. Gox bankruptcy proceedings to its creditors, Karpeles will be left with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin as profit, for his direct involvement in the loss of nearly $7 billion worth of bitcoins within a two-year span.<br><br>
“When it’s all sorted out, Karpelès would pretty much get [the] vast majority” of the extra value, Kolin Burges told the WSJ,  a creditor who held 311 bitcoins at Mt. Gox. “So that seems incredibly unfair.”</div></blockquote>

Some other backstory:<br><br>
Mark Karpeles hired as PIA CTO in 2018<br><a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn/reviews/private-internet-access/" class="postlink">https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn/reviews/ ... et-access/</a> OCT 24, 2022<br>
Private Internet Access Review - Secure Apps, but 3 Cons (restoreprivacy.com)<br><strong class="text-strong">Controversy surrounding the CTO of PIA</strong><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>For reasons that are not entirely clear, some of the higher-ups at Private Internet Access decided to hire Mark Karpeles as the CTO (Chief Technology Officer) in April 2018.<br><br>
To understand why this was upsetting to many PIA users, we’ll just take a quick look at Mark Karpeles.<br><br>
Mark Karpeles was running Mt. Gox in 2014 when it suddenly collapsed, with millions of dollars in Bitcoins disappearing. Karpeles was subsequently arrested in Japan and charged with fraud and embezzlement. As to where all the Bitcoins that were stored at Mt. Gox ended up, nobody seems to know:<br><br>
650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for as a result of the Mt. Gox hack. A number of online theories have been developed as to where the missing coins are. Some have suggested that Mt. Gox never had the amount of coins that it claimed, and that Karpelés had manipulated the numbers to make it appear that Mt. Gox held more bitcoin than it in fact held.<br><br>
In March 2019, Karpeles was found guilty of tampering with financial records in a Japanese court. <em class="text-italics">March 15, 2019 Former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles Gets Suspended Jail Term <a href="https://archive.ph/eIp29#selection-2685.0-2685.57" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/eIp29#selection-2685.0-2685.57</a></em><br><br>
 Due to the controversy that erupted in various forums after Karpeles joined PIA, Andrew Lee (co-founder of PIA) wrote a blog post April 24, 2018 <a href="https://archive.ph/gsuR2" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/gsuR2</a> where he explained his reasoning. The post discusses “Mistakes, Forgiveness and Human Progress” – but that may not be enough for PIA users who trust the company with securing their private data.</div></blockquote>

Edit:  Well... as it turns out Andrew Lee was a cofounder of Mt. Gox Live:<br>
2013  <a href="https://proprivacy.com/privacy-news/an-interview-with-private-internet-access-founder-andrew-lee" class="postlink">https://proprivacy.com/privacy-news/an- ... andrew-lee</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The following is an interview with Andrew Lee, who co-founded Private Internet Access, one of the most popular VPN services right now. He also co-founded Mt. Gox Live which was acquired by Mt. Gox, the world’s leading Bitcoin exchange, and built their official mobile application. He is a long-time advocate of privacy. We asked him about his history, the future of PIA, and the future of privacy in this NSA snooping world.</div></blockquote>
<em class="text-italics">Note: It was announced in November 24,  2019 that PIA was set to be acquired by Kape.</em> <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/private-internet-access-to-be-acquired-by-kape/" class="postlink">https://torrentfreak.com/private-intern ... d-by-kape/</a></div>

Indeed there is.<br><br>
Btw, I don't know if you have this but it's one less thing to unravel:  Where Edon garden came from <a href="https://archive.ph/Ziw6Z" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/Ziw6Z</a> (Andrew Lee connection) and the logo <a href="https://archive.ph/Ip3cf" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/Ip3cf</a>  The fact that talks went on for months between Voat and the Angel investor before the arrangement was announced is one possible explanation of why Edon showed up on the Voat about page earlier than the announcement (some people stated it did).</div>

According to Andrew Lee's Lifeboat Foundation page, he cofounded and sold Mt. Gox North America to Tibanne Co. (Karpeles's company founded 2009). (btw Jeffrey Epstein had a Lifeboat Foundation page too and another person connected to London Trust Media: <br>

LTM is a private holdings company with its largest brand, which he cofounded, PrivateInternetAccess.com, being the world’s leading VPN service provider (as seen on MSN Money, Kiplinger, Lifehacker, Torrentfreak, Business Insider, and more). This was a major feat as the industry now includes major players including Symantec and Boingo amongst others. Andrew has also cofounded and sold many startups, including his most recent: <span style="color:#FF0000">Mt. Gox North America, Inc., which was acquired by Tibanne Co. Ltd.

Karpeles story turns into a can of worms imho.. natural born grifter???<br>
en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Mark_Karpelès
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>According to Jason Mick of Dailytech, Karpelès was found guilty of a financial computer crime and of money transfer fraud when he was a teenager. The court apparently gave him a 3 month suspended sentence and no criminal record. This was later confirmed by Ashley Barr, a former Mt. Gox employee.<br><br>
In 2009, Karpelès moved to Japan.<br><br>
According to a joint report by Cyrus Farivar of Ars Technica and Pierre Alonso of Le Monde, Karpelès was found guilty of fraud when he was tried in absentia in France in 2010. He also admitted to having "pirated" a server to French authorities. He was sentenced to a year in jail but has not yet served his sentence.[2]<br><br>
Ross Ulbricht, while on trial for operating the undercover Silk Road marketplace, claimed that the pseudonymous "Dread Pirate Roberts" behind Silk Road was not him but Mark Karpelès. Karpelès publicly denied the claim on Twitter, and Ulbricht was eventually found guilty [1]<br><br>
..</div></blockquote>

Actually it was DHS officer Jared Der-Yeghiayan who argued that Karpeles was connected to the Silk Road case<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Homeland Security agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan admitted that he had pursued Karpeles in the summer of 2013 in his search for the real identity of online alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" who ran the narcotics operation.<br><br>
Der-Yeghiayan in August 2013 drafted a search warrant for email accounts of Karpeles in California and New York, where Ulbricht's trial is taking place.<br><br>
In the warrant he wrote that he believed Karpeles owned and hosted the Silk Road website and argued that his background as a computer programmer made him "well-suited" to the role.<br><br>
The France-born Karpeles, based in Japan, has reportedly refused to travel to the United States for questioning in connection with the collapse of MtGox in 2014.<br><br>
In an interview with The Daily Beast conducted by Tokyo-based reporters, Karpeles acknowledged owning a hosting service used by part of the Silk Road network but refused to reveal any more information.<br><br>
"Part of the Silk Road network, silkroadmarket.org, was using a hosting service that I still own for one of my clients. I cannot disclose their name for obvious reasons," he told the website.<br><br>
"I have nothing to do with Silk Road and do not condone what has been happening there. I believe Bitcoin (and its underlying technology) is not meant to help people evade the law, but to improve everyone’s way of life by offering never thought before possibilities."</div></blockquote>

<br>
news.yahoo.com/us-defense-argues-wrong-man-accused-silk-road-063133032.html<br><br>
Karpeles added, however, that a website used to market Silk Road, Silkroadmarket.org, was hosted by KalyHost.com, a Web service run by Karpeles' company Tibanne, the Tokyo-based parent of MtGox.<br><br>
"The site Silkroadmarket.org was indeed hosted on KalyHost according to our records," he wrote. Karpeles would not reveal who registered Silkroadmarket.org, citing Tibanne privacy policies. "The domain expired one year after being bought without being renewed and we never had any further order from that customer," he wrote. "I do not believe law enforcement ever asked us about this."<br><br>

Then there's this bit of (connections unconfirmed) intrigue thrown into the story
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
The hundreds of thousands of bitcoins stolen from the Mt. Gox exchange four years ago could be recovered, but there are powerful forces against it, according to bitcoin entrepreneur William Mook.<br><br>
...Not long after the exchange’s collapse, the public was shocked by the death of a virtual currency exchange First Meta’s CEO. The 28-year-old Autumn Radtke was found dead, having fallen from her apartment building in Singapore. Some media reported it was a suicide while others referred to it as a “questionable financial-sector death.”<br><br>
“Autumn Radtke and her team and others, quietly found half the bitcoins that were supposedly stolen by Mt. Gox,” Mook told RT exclusively.<br><br>
That shows the strength of the blockchain technology, he said, adding “We had hopes the balance of the 'lost' Mt. Gox coins could be recovered as well.”</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
PSA: Shells (Linus’ newest sponsor) has Mike Karpeles (the guy who lost Mt. Gox’s money) as its CTO.<br>
EDIT: “Now it’s time for the Quick Bits, brought to you by Shells!”<br>
Considering that Mt. Gox was basically looted due to multiple security flaws, and Karpeles then tried to cover up the losses by deleting evidence, this is not a good look for a company that’s supposed to be providing secure cloud-based desktops.<br><br>
Also, Shells’s founder Andrew Lee, who is touted as “one of the founders of Private Internet Access” is apparently now running Freenode IRC as his personal playground/advertising billboard, which explains why most of Freenode IRC’s volunteer staff just quit en masse.<br><br>
Source for all these claims: Ars Technica<br><br>
(PIA has been sold to another firm, which has its own sordid history)<br><br>
Anyone want to give the over/under that this will be reported on TechLinked?</div></blockquote>

And I had not even started the WHT post about Andrew Lee... it's like these two are joined at the hip.<br><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210607041652/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/freenode-irc-has-been-taken-over-by-the-crown-prince-of-korea/" class="postlink">http://web.archive.org/web/202106070416 ... -of-korea/</a><br>
Freenode IRC staff resign en masse after takeover by Korea’s “crown prince”<br>
Former staffer alleges "a hostile entity is now in control... and has your data."<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Freenode has been the world's largest IRC network since 2013, with roughly three times as many users as its closest competitor, IRCnet. Last week, the massive IRC network was taken over by tech entrepreneur and "Korean Crown Prince" Andrew Lee—a move that the network's staff has apparently unanimously classified as a "hostile takeover," although Lee himself claims these are only "rumors" and "simply untrue."<br>
At first blush, it's tempting for an outside observer—someone who isn't already familiar with the history of the network's ownership and management—to shrug and say "well, who knows." Lee lays out several hundred words of explanation in a blog post currently featured on Freenode's front page—most of which sounds reasonable.<br><br>
But the one question Lee never addresses—let alone answers—is why at least 14 separate staff members would quit en masse, all disagreeing with the story he tells.<br><br>
A dubious contract<br>
In 2017, Christel Dahlskjaer—who was, at the time, head of Freenode staff—created a corporation, Freenode Ltd., which she immediately sold to Lee. Dahlskjaer and Lee told Freenode staff and users that the incorporation was only done as necessary paperwork in order to sponsor a conference and that day-to-day operations would remain unchanged.<br><br>
Contract or no contract, staff and developers of Freenode maintain that it wasn't actually possible to sell the network—the staff is all volunteers, and the infrastructure itself wasn't owned by Dahlskjaer in the first place. According to resigning Freenode developer Aaron Jones, however, "Andrew has more money than us, and so we cannot fight this."<br><br>
Although the contract in question was signed in 2017, staffers didn't begin objecting until this year, when operational changes began appearing without their control or consent.<br>
A unilateral decision on advertising<br>
In February 2021, Dahlskjaer placed the logo for Shells—a Lee-owned company offering cloud-based virtual desktops—prominently on Freenode's front page. By itself, this might seem innocuous—FOSS projects accept sponsorships and advertising all the time. But staffers, who were supposedly still in control of the network, weren't consulted about the arrangement—and they did not approve.<br><br><span style="color:#FF0000">One reason for staffers' virulent disapproval is Shells CTO Mark Karpelès. Karpelès is the founder of the defunct Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, which lost nearly 850,000 bitcoin (currently worth a staggering $33.4 billion-with-a-B US dollars) to attackers who exploited a massive security flaw. Karpelès was found guilty in a Tokyo court of deliberately tampering with records to cover up the exchange's various losses, although he was found innocent of outright embezzlement.</span><br><br>
As former staffer Aaron Jones explains in his lengthy letter of resignation—which links to similar announcements from other departing high-profile staffers—this wasn't the only issue with the new ad. According to Jones, sponsorships are normally only found at freenode.net/acknowledgements—making the prominent Shells logo in the upper right of Freenode's front page more of a departure from the norm than it might seem.<br><br>
Jones goes on to say that Dahlskjaer was either unable or unwilling to explain the sudden new ad to staffers, choosing to resign instead. (Lee claims that Freenode staff "harassed" Dahlskjaer into resignation; Jones and other departing staffers deny this characterization.) Freenode staff elected Tom Wesley (aka tomaw) to replace her.<br><br>
Escalation in April<br>
Beginning in April 2021, Lee's exercise of control continued ramping up:<br><br>
Staffers created a blog post outlining changes in leadership and announcing a change to newly developed back-end ircd software Solanum. According to Jones, Lee summarily removed the post—and manually edited the website's built-in history to create the impression that it had never existed.<br>
Later in April, a Freenode test network—in use to get ready for the infrastructure shift to Solanum—was shut down without discussion. Wesley (tomaw) performed the shutdown and refused to say why; Jones and others believe Lee was behind the shutdown, used threat of legal force to make Wesley comply, and issued related gag orders to OFTC staff.<br>
Lee registered the channel #freenode-board without discussing it with staff—and, according to Jones, without proper authority (since only official group contacts are allowed to create channels in Freenode's primary namespace, and Lee was not an official Freenode contact).<br>
Shane Allen (aka nirvana), an associate and employee of Lee's, bragged about "turning" tomaw, and he attempted to bribe prominent user Ariadne with promises of ops privileges, saying, "I'll make sure you get +oO in #freenode so you can kick people. My gift to you pal."<br>
On May 11, Lee began issuing notices to staff as a group and directly to individual Freenode staffers. Everything came from "the board"—an entity that staffers say never existed, and even now is merely a euphemism for Lee himself.<br>
Advertisement<br>
On May 12, Lee (aka rasengan) posted his version of events—in which he claims legal ownership of Freenode, along with a list of grievances—in a Github gist. (The gist is considerably saltier than the version of events Lee posted to Freenode's public-facing blog a week later.)<br><br>
Libera Chat<br>
A week after Lee's effectively public announcement of ownership and de facto dictatorial operation of Freenode, the staffers who resigned from Freenode created Libera.chat as a replacement.<br><br>
Libera Chat is incorporated as a Swedish nonprofit organization, owned and operated by volunteer staffers who are voting members of the organization. It has a small, member-elected board—currently consisting of chair, treasurer, projects and community rep, engineering rep/vice chair, and operations rep. But most decisions are to be taken by the membership as a whole.<br><br>
The membership also elects two auditors, tasked with auditing the board's actions on behalf of the membership. A transparency report is to be published annually, detailing bookkeeping and the auditors' findings along with the standard annual report from the board itself.<br><br>
All current Libera Chat boardmembers and auditors are Freenode staffers who resigned in protest of Lee's recent actions and assumption of control.</div></blockquote></div>

I’m not sure there’ll be anything here you won’t already know... the only thing I am sure of at this point is I’m glad I didn’t go for the VPN :)<br>
Here they are anyway:<br><br>
- The Mossad Affiliated Company that Bought Voat.co, Kape Technologies, is Back to Sell You a VPN. -<br>
ExpressVPN critics are concerned about ties to former intelligence agents and adware    <br><a href="https://archive.ph/2021.09.28-033620/https://reclaimthenet.org/expressvpn-sale-new-owners/" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/2021.09.28-033620/ht ... ew-owners/</a> <br>
“ExpressVPN, continues to be riddled with controversies mere weeks after the acquisition by Kape Technologies worth just under $1 billion. Kape is a company that some industry observers are now openly calling “a former malware and adware distributor.” For whistleblower Edward Snowden, what crossed the line was the revelation that ExpressVPN CIO Daniel Gericke was one of three former US intelligence officers who earlier in September settled with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) for their role in UAE’s spying project Raven.” <br><br>

In the past XX months we went from Putt keeping us informed of his work &amp; being very active in the community. X months ago a first wave of ddos, Putt still being himself. X months ago a 2nd wave of ddos, the "Now Hiring" followed by the "Where We Find Ourselves" post and nothing more.<br>
Redacted -<br>
Now for the interesting bit. Out of the blue a goat discovered an inactive page, <a href="https://voat.co/about" class="postlink">https://voat.co/about</a>. The regular page is <a href="https://voat.co/content/about" class="postlink">https://voat.co/content/about</a>. The 2 important things are on the bottom of that page, what's the contact email &amp; who owns the Voat mascot?<br><a href="https://searchvoat.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80c8e5ececefc0e5e4efeeaee7e1f2e4e5ee"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bdf5d8d1d1d2fd">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a><a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=152553" class="username">edon</a>.garden &amp; Edon ---&gt; <a href="http://Edon.Garden" class="postlink">http://Edon.Garden</a><br>
That name has been in the code for some time now, at least X months. The "new" contact email's domain was registered in March &amp; updated mid June.<br>
Guess who's chaperoning that project ?<br>
Imperial Family, the new London Trust Media, post merger with Kape Technologies.<br><a href="https://imperialfamily.com/" class="postlink">https://imperialfamily.com/</a><br>
So... shady as fuck (((Kape))) buys PIA (LTM), they rebrand as Imperial Family and suddenly Edon appears as one of their projects. The inactive page links to the same site, it's in the code &amp; Putt is MIA.<br>
Now Voat is dead.”<br>
Who's running the ship ?<br>
Is Putt under an NDA? Is he still part owner?<br>
Is Edon a cover to finance Voat ?<br>
Did he get financed to code for a different project based on his work here?<br>
Is Voat now officially a honeypot to put people on a list ? To doxx or worse ?<br>

Here's an archive to the now deleted "about" page referred to in my previous comment:<br><a href="https://archive.fo/http://voat.co/about" class="postlink">https://archive.fo/http://voat.co/about</a><br>
The interesting change happened between the 24rh of May &amp; 30th of December 2020. (???)<br>
Feel free to make a post about it, I'll email you all I have on the subject if you like... I've stopped caring enough to shit the place up some more with this, Qtards already got that accomplished on their own<br><br>
I asked Putt about the Edon stuff when he popped into chat one day. He said Edon is now the name of the platform/software that Voat runs on. He seemed to be implying that the software is in the works to be rolled out for other websites, and not just for Voat.<br><br>
That was one of my suspicions, that he wanted to compete with Aether at some point with what he developed here.<br>

You remember we all freaked out about Voat suddenly having "<a href="https://searchvoat.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c44494040436c49484342024b4d5e484942"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="83ebe6efefecc3">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a><a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=152553" class="username">edon</a>.garden" listed as the contact email right before New Year? Well have a look at what site listed under technology on this site.<br>
So what is this imperialfamily then? Well that in turn has the email referring to londontrustmedia ( London Trust Media and KAPE are Joining Hands ) which was the parent company of PrivateInternetAccess or PIA confirming what most have speculated all along. That they were indeed Voat's 'Angel investor'. Because 'Jewish money' there's a lot who would have problems with that, but no me personally. PIA did as a matter of fact have a history of sponsoring things purely out of passion. <br>
Now that PIA has merged with Kape things get more hairy though. For one part I know not all of PIA's past passion projects have been assured further funding past 6 months of the merger(about 1 month from now) and for another Kape does not have the same history of doing 'good deeds'. In fact they have a history of turning things into shit.<br>
I would happily have sat on this secret till the end of times, but between this and Puttsy losing interest right around the time he would have been notified that the merger was about to take place, I'm not convinced Voat has much of a future. Then I'd have to tell you. And now I have.<br><br>
Ever heard of Unit 8200 and it's links to Kape ?<br><br>
Kape technologies, previously known as CrossRider founded by Koby Menachemi, ex spy from unit 8200.<br>
"Unit 8200 (Hebrew: יחידה 8200‎, Yehida Shmoneh-Matayim) is an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. It also appears in military publications as the Central Collection Unit of the Intelligence Corps and is sometimes referred to as Israeli SIGINT National Unit (ISNU)."<br>
A lot more info here, both the article &amp; comments are relevant. Notice the owner of PIA being the on the top.<br><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21679682" class="postlink">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21679682</a> ( PIA VPN to be acquired by malware company founded by former Israeli spy | Hacker News)<br><br>
CEO of Kape Technologies is a Jewish guy who got his undergrad degree from Hebrew University in Jerusalem, his grad degree from a university in Tel Aviv, and an MBA from Cambridge<br>
So Kape owns PIA now, and PIA funded Voat... <br>

61 MILLION DOLLARS, before the bitcoin semi-collapse<br>
$104,527,220 (104 million) in 14,000 BTC this hour!<br>
THIS POST WILL BE DELETED OR DOWNVOTED, like usual, but I answered honestly<br>
Bitcoin wallet address putt used for voat.co had coins added to it seen in BTC address trackers, and then the bitcoins went so far up in value that it was staggering value.<br>
In 2017 voat.co was down to their last $61 million US dollars provable via a bitcoin history wallet tool :<br>
voat's two BTC wallets : <br>
1PhBpbED6uEnrvy5s9F9axBZbK8fWAeZdc 3NZvuAk3Csf1UP1KCmzN9dhiXTwvhTgr9k<br>
They're both deposit addresses to the same bitcoin wallet. You can check that for yourself here: <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com" class="postlink">https://www.walletexplorer.com</a> If you search that wallet back to around this time or a little before, the facts become apparent. <br>
Here's just before this time era.. <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/00000014ea8b260f?page=89300" class="postlink">https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/0 ... page=89300</a> (adjust page era to cover date span relevant).<br>
That shows voat had over 14,000 bitcoin in this wallet just before the famous 2017 voat announcement for more crypto.<br>
Now, that's not as much money as it would be today, at that time bitcoin was worth over $4,400 a piece. So, that’s still over 61 million dollars. They could have funded the next 20 years of voat for $780,000, if they are really paying over 6k a month, and not even put a dent in that.<br>
With 61 million shown in that link, supposedly they could get rid of CloudFlare and use BitMitigate. But maybe the 61 million dollars was to NOT stop using CloudFlare ?<br>
"to to NOT stop using CloudFlare", you wonder?<br>
Yes.<br>
These two links USED to return fascinating user comments hosted on voat.co, but less than 12 months ago , both search engines now return useless misdirection for the following two links :<br><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=honeypot+site%3Avoat.co" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/search?q=honeypot+site%3Avoat.co</a><br><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=honeypot+site%3Avoat.co&amp;ia=web" class="postlink">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=honeypot+site ... .co&amp;ia=web</a><br>
You wrote :<br>
I've been here a while but I an unaware of sizable sum that was donated<br>
and your account is 4.3 years old, but obviously you have never paid attention to the BTC voat.co owned in 2017 worth far more than $61 million now, if not spent or wasted. In fact, over 100 million in BTC for the voat.co wallet contents at that brief moment in time.<br>
Today's price for BTC for this hour, and voat.co had 14,000 BTC at $7,466.23 per coin for Jan 5 2020, equals ..<br>
14,000 * $7,466.23 = $104,527,220<br><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies?guccounter=1" class="postlink">https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies?guccounter=1</a><br>
$104,527,220<br>
If it was invested or otherwise not wasted, it could be higher, less money spent.<br>
In my own opinion, knowing more than I want to let on, I estimate voat.co has no less than $10 million, and no more than $104 million.<br>
Other wallet history tracker/scanner forensic tools exist such as chainalysis.com<br>
EDIT : I might not be right. It's possible that the wallet that the two voat.co wallets dumped into could have been a hotwallet for a service site and not represent a specific entities personal holdings, which means voat.co might actually have far far far far less BTC than my post above implies. Only dedicated BTC forensic people can gleen more than I have energy or motivation to. This means perhaps that though some conservatives want voat.co to stay alive, and many nations LEAs want voat.co to stay alive, and free speech advocates want voat.co to stay alive, that voat.co might have at least at bare minimum, enough money to pay server bills to stay alive, but not enough to hire very trusted people with the best skills possible to work fulltime rewriting voat.co. Occams razor would be : If voat.co is so well funded, why is it still seizing up and dumping debug forensics constantly and not written like other large social sites? See? Or is that the canary itself? Take the funding, but be non-proactive to the funders? It's a riddle<br><br><br>

Around 40m people have now taken a VisualDNA quiz, giving us the largest personality database anywhere in the world, enabling us to connect personality type to behaviour so we can predict who people are and what they’ll do<br>

Exponentially expanding data on the relationship between behaviour and personality, and vice-versa, we can discern an unknown users’ personality type from their behaviour, and we can then predict a person’s behaviour by relating it back to their character type.

NSFW Anon **ATTENTION PATRIOTS** Proof that voat has been funded and is probably a honeypot. (QRV)<br><br>
First, lets start off with a little back story for the newbies. Right around the time pizzagate was being sent to voat the 2 owners disappeared and when they returned they acted like different people. Take into account that @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=149161" class="username">SaneGoatiSwear</a> was made to look like a crazy person off his meds and brigaded for over 10,000 ccp. I even believed sane wasn't so sane, when I first got here because he uses the same divide and conquer crap they do “the Jews" “muh Hitler" and racial divide. Credit goes to him for pointing this out though. Notice the upvote count and the comments seem to agree. Plus, at this point in time sane seemed to be fairly liked. Hopefully some older goats will jump in and clarify, I'm going on assumption because I got here with pizzagate and only know of sane from when he was being portrayed as insane. I know the shills will jump in and claim he's crazy or that I'm him, it's their only trick. I believe Sane is also the meaning of all this 1990 bs too, here's why..<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/AnonBoard/1698273" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/AnonBoard/1698273</a><br><a href="https://voat.co/v/newsubverses/1632618" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/newsubverses/1632618</a><br><a href="https://voat.co/v/TIL2/1627671" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/TIL2/1627671</a><br><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2752621" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/whatever/2752621</a><br>
Now, on to the evidence Voat has been fully funded and the owners are trying to sap more money out of the good people on Voat in true PAYtriot/FAKEtriot fashion. In approximately June 2017 @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1689" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">PuttItOut</a> posted this thread claiming Voat was broke and was likely going to shut down if they couldn't come up with over 6k a month for server costs. It even spawned this artucle.. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/goodbye-and-good-riddance-to-voat-reddits-gross-clone-1795337099" class="postlink">https://gizmodo.com/goodbye-and-good-ri ... 1795337099</a> Unfortunately, none of this was true and they were lying to all of you.

You can check that for yourself here: <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com" class="postlink">https://www.walletexplorer.com</a> If you search that wallet back to around this time or a little before, the lies become apparent. Here's just before this time.. <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/00000014ea8b260f?page=89300" class="postlink">https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/0 ... page=89300</a> This shows they had over 14,000 bitcoin in this wallet just before this announcement. Now, that's not as much money as it would be today, at that time bitcoin was worth over $2300 a piece. So, that’s still over 32 million dollars. They could have funded the next 10 years of voat for $780,000, if they are really paying over 6k a month, and not even put a dent in that. <br>
What do I believe all this means? We're sitting in the honeypot we all thought we were sitting in. That explains all the hateful rhetoric “kill all Jews”, “muh Hitler”, the black hate, it explains it all. They are looking to use all this against us to make us look how the MSM portrays us. Typical CTR/SJW bullshit and the owners have made a ton of money for selling you out to these clowns. Will they pull the plug on Voat? I'm sorry if they do and it separates us all temporarily. But, I won't watch good patriots get taken advantage of. <br>
How does this make you old goats feel?<br><br>

1. everything seems to be all right<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1143444/5675043/10#5675043" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/114 ... 10#5675043</a><br>
Atko: "Thanks for filling me in. Sub transfer could be undone, but for the rest of his subs I see nothing good coming out of us interfering. As for all default sub rules - we could try to abolish them all and see how it goes. If spam or irrelevant content floats to the top... well, so be it. I'll talk to Puttitout."<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1143444/5723980/10#5723980" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/114 ... 10#5723980</a><br>
Atko: "Thank you, this is an eye opener. I will discuss it with puttitout asap. I hope you stay around until we resolve this once and for all."<br>
except maybe for this:<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/test/comments/1130688" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/test/comments/1130688</a><br>
d42 7 21 441 1kk QY BBm 9 (v/test) <br>
...<br><br>
and puttitout as well, all seems fine<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/1178130/5832730/10#5832730" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/announcements/comment ... 10#5832730</a><br>
PuttItOut: "Two tethered iPhone 4s for the database and one IBM thinkpad running Windows Me for the web server. I miss using that thinkpad. /s The reality isn't much different than this IMO."<br>
like this post<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/1178130" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/1178130</a><br>

PuttItOut: "Vote delay fix will be in soon."<br><br>
2. then atko and puttitout go missing<br>
last things said by atko, where he takes a personality change from always talking dev to getting giggly with theodorekent not odd, just noting a serious sustained departure from most all previous comments other than test ermergerds and a couple errant ones like &lt;3. (and more specifically to the conspiracy, the marked change is between "downvoating algo needs to change..." 1 month ago to "amen." 1 month ago on this page of his comments:<br><a href="https://voat.co/user/Atko/comments" class="postlink">https://voat.co/user/Atko/comments</a><br>
his last comments before the long sleep:<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments/1190061/5888713/10#5888713" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments ... 10#5888713</a><br>
Atko: "Nah, just casual stuff ;) I ain't famous and I ain't loved. I also ain't powerful :p"<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments/1190061/5888699/10#5888699" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments ... 10#5888699</a><br>
Atko: "You're just saying that to make me feel better :p Love you anyways :)"<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments/1190061/5890899/10#5890899" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments ... 10#5890899</a><br>
Atko: "I want kids. Lets do it. &lt;3"<br><br>
before putt dissapears, he says things publicly like:<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1187332/5874803/10#5874803" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/118 ... 10#5874803</a><br>
PuttItOut: "I'll take care of this tomorrow, thanks for the post."<br>
and then<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments/1190061/5885939/10#5885939" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments ... 10#5885939</a><br>
PuttItOut: "Done."<br>
and then promises to finish a manual subverse request for me:<br>
PuttItOut: "No, I usually do transfers once a week, will get to tomorrow. No need to delete/repost."<br><br>
and then disappears...<br>
for example: <a href="https://voat.co/v/subverserequest/new?page=1" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/subverserequest/new?page=1</a><br>
he hasn't done a subverse request in a month and a week and a half<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/test/comments/1148995/5794301/10#5794301" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/test/comments/1148995 ... 10#5794301</a><br>
PuttItOut: "<br>
I'll be back later, like in 3 or 4 hours<br>
Lies!"<br>
lies indeed.<br><br>
3. the admins at least say goodbye, right?<br>
nop, atko posts this epic post about war after posting a news story about a gay mormon pop singer, and says he's "on the road" at the end of the post offhandedly ( <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1185619" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1185619</a> ). consider that <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/21373" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/21373</a> atko has announced a vacation in the past.<br><br>
4. nothing for weeks<br>
i post a post jokingly taking bets when putt will return <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1223400" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1223400</a><br>
until<br><br>
5. atko returns in chat, posts supposed picture<br>
link to paste of relevent chat text: <a href="http://pasted.co/84be96d1" class="postlink">http://pasted.co/84be96d1</a><br>
and posts a comment<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1225872/6054030/10#6054030" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/122 ... 10#6054030</a><br>
then atko posts something about a boy finding out he'll be brother of twins<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/videos/comments/1228731" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/videos/comments/1228731</a><br><br>
6. i post another front-page v/all 'where's putt' post<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1229467" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/whatever/comments/1229467</a><br><br>
7. atko posts an hour later<br>

and mentions puttitout "What could I or Puttitout do that would make your life easier?" but makes no comment on where putt is, what's happened to him, nor does he say anything to the group of goats bleating for a response on putt's whereabouts.<br>
and also says:<br>
that "I'm alive and well :) I was on holidays but also, Switzerland is amazing during summer, so I take every chance that I get to go out for a ride on my MT07."<br>
and links a pic <a href="https://i.sli.mg/VfuG92.jpgJPG" class="postlink">https://i.sli.mg/VfuG92.jpgJPG</a><br><br><br>
8. and now. we hit the 30 day mark. a very long time to go without putt.<br><a href="https://voat.co/user/PuttItOut/comments" class="postlink">https://voat.co/user/PuttItOut/comments</a><br><br>
Questions Time, Goat Kids!<br>
why did our admins leave without telling? safeguard voat? well, maybe..<br>
why would our admin say he's doing one thing and do another? again, to safegaurd voat?, what against? sanegoat? well, maybe. 8D<br>
why would our admins leave? so many bugs, so many problems, financial instability, alpha getting old, is the last time to go on vaca. maybe they were burned out? take turns vacaying. no time? fine do it together, but keep a watch and a presence through cellphone voat use. sheeit. it's not that hard. what, they failed to consider the options? failed to consider that option? and just left voat for a solid 2 and a half weeks entirely admin-less? we could have posted so much illegal content they would have come back to fibbies and no voat. not only were they gone, we KNEW they were gone. as you may have seen, i've been posting about it regularly.<br>
why all the questions? because the admins won't/can't answer!<br>
it's of considerable concern that the admins would both disappear without a word without a trace for over two weeks, only for one to return after a considerable hullabalo is ruckused up about them missing, and public posts are made; could be causal, could not. but here in v/conspiracy we can't afford to believe in coincedence, so, without much further preface:<br><br>
THEORY TIME, GOAT KIDS<br>
let's explore the theories i've heard and have had:<br>
Vacation Dicks Theories<br>
• putt's on vacation and totally left without telling anyone but atko, and atko's just not bothering to tell us because opsec or to putt (or atko) it could simply be nunya -- - none of our business. although an argument can be made that it is our business. and atko went on vacation as well without telling anyone. at the same time. both without telling anyone. also, it doesn't explain why akto's still silent when we have asked for a bone to be thrown. <br>
• there is a rumor putt went to ibiza, so naturally, he may have gone to ibiza, this is in line with the previous theory.<br>
• along the prior theory, putt went to ibiza and is dead. it's a crazy world. that's a sad one and we don't like it. or he could be detained, or for some other reason unable to return - sick, injured, etc. <br>
• it's possible there's a much larger conspiracy that started within the ibiza vacation. putt could have gotten atko caught up in a uncharted-like mess, "DAMNIT NATE" and while atko's back alittle, he's really just gearing up for the final assault to free putt from the sex-torture chamber in a black fat anti-trump billionare's dungeon under a castle right outside ibiza. <br>
Conspiracy Theories<br>
• the vacation stories are a lie; putt and atko are being dissolved in a barrell of acid by the CIA, as they had to replace them; atko's already a replacement atko. replace-putt is currently being trained. this IS v/conspiracy :D<br>
• putt's having a laugh on old sane and just not touching voat as long as it wrecks sane's head. <br>
• putt and atko were never real, were just covers, this has always been a honeypot...<br>
• the GRAND THEORY: putt and atko went missing together, both without saying anything ('goin for a ride' doesn't count, atko), and the only proof we have of atko being back is a picture with no stamp - nor any relative objects like a newspaper with the date - and some text and a couple posts. it took weeks, but the replacements could have tortured the passwords out of them and now have access and are pretending to be atko, and will eventually come on and pretend to be putt once the story they have concoted is all fleshed out. where atko and puttitout are, who knows?<br>
kek v/conspiracy is fun. we should have more voatspiracies... orrr maybe not. 8D<br>
in any case<br>
just remember<br><a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/139434" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/139434</a><br>
"WE LOVE YOU" said puttitout and we say "I LOVE YOU" back<br>
hope you're ok, buddy!<br>
UPDATE<br>@<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3210" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">Failure</a> says putt has talked recently in a dev chat. no proof<br>@<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1707" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">derram</a> has pointed out some creepy shit<br><a href="https://voat.co/user/technician90/comments" class="postlink">https://voat.co/user/technician90/comments</a><br><a href="https://voat.co/user/CrispyKat/comments" class="postlink">https://voat.co/user/CrispyKat/comments</a><br>

Karpeles Admits to Running WillyBot, Pleads Not Guilty to Charges Dariusz  July 15, 2017<br><br><br><em class="text-italics">Most Bitcoin users experienced the MtGox disaster first hand or heard accounts of it from other users. Mark Karpeles -the chief executive of MtGox- is standing trial on charges of embezzlement and data manipulation in the Tokyo District Court. He has plead not guilty to these charges.</em><br><br>
WHAT HAPPENED WITH MTGOX: A BRIEF HISTORY<br>
MtGox was one of the first time that Bitcoin users and traders got burned badly. There was a time when MtGox was responsible for over 80% of Bitcoin trades worldwide, but the company shuttered its doors in 2014 and filed for bankruptcy. Millions and millions of dollars worth of coins and assets were lost, while MtGox blamed a hack for the loss of assets.<br><br>
WHAT DOES KARPELES HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?<br>
Karpeles was the chief executive of MtGox when this all took place, but there are even more damning actions he allegedly took during this time with MtGox. He allegedly moved about $3 million from an account holding customer funds to an account in his name. Though this strikes me as blatant embezzlement, his defense claims it is not. However, his defense team has made no apparent effort to deny that these money transfers took place.<br><br>
While his defense is trying to downplay his involvement -he recently said he was only an engineer-, the prosecution is not pulling any punches. They argue that much of the stolen money was used for personal items -which would suggest embezzelment-. 3D printers and expensive canopy beds are among the items that the prosecution cited as luxuries purchased with stolen funds.<br><br><span style="color:#FF0000">In all of this, Karpeles seems to be completely blase about the fact that his actions and the inadequacies of MtGox not only robbed people of hard won fortunes, but also damaged Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ image enough that it struggles to be anything but “internet drug money” in the minds of many.</span> The chances of wider adoption were definitely hurt by this event and Karpeles’ actions.<br><br>
WILLYBOT, MTGOX, AND KARPELES<br>
WillyBot is almost as notorious for Bitcoin users and MtGox itself. This bot operated as a trading bot, much to the concern of most traders on MtGox. It later came out that the WillyBot was manipulating the market significantly by pumping up trading volumes with many fraudulent trades. Apparently Karpeles has openly admitted to running WillyBot -also known as an obligation exchange-.<br><br><br>
Admitting this is huge. This bot is largely held responsible for the enormous crash in Bitcoin’s price in 2014. This makes sense, because if Bitcoin’s price was -at the time- only being held up by a massive amount of fraudulent trades on an exchange responsible for the vast majority of Bitcoin trading then it was only a matter of time before something went wrong.<br><br>
Karpeles maintains that this was not illegal because it was for the good of the company. The trial will resume in October.[/quote]<br><br><br>
Ironic, Karpeles' company Tibanne had a web service Kalyhost, that was providing service used by 'internet drug money' related business!  
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Karpeles added, however, that a website used to market Silk Road, Silkroadmarket.org, was hosted by KalyHost.com, a Web service run by Karpeles' company Tibanne, the Tokyo-based parent of MtGox.</div></blockquote> MtGox's Karpeles denies involvement in Silk Road | Computerworld (archive.org) &nbsp;<br><br>
But the suspicions that DHS had were thrown out of court for lack of concrete evidence<br>
"In its filing Monday, the prosecution attacked that Silkroadmarket.org connection as well. Prosecutors wrote that the DHS's investigation had subsequently revealed that Karpeles hadn't registered Silkroadmarket.org, but it had instead been registered by Ulbricht using Karpeles' web hosting company Kalyhost. "The fact that the defendant used Mr. Karpeles’ webhosting service to host the 'silkroadmarket.org' website turned out to be the only connection [special agent] Der-Yeghiayan ever found between the website and Mr. Karpeles," the prosecution's letter reads." <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/01/silk-road-judge-eviscerates-mt-gox-ceo-karpeles-defense/" class="postlink">www.wired.com/2015/01/silk-road-judge-e ... s-defense/</a><br>

9 yr. ago<br>
I had a job interview with MtGox a couple of weeks ago for a frontend developer position. After talking about their technical environment I declined the position. Contemplated publicizing my story, but I have zero proof that the interview took place. But fuck me is their environment fucked up....<br><br>

I was told that up until a few weeks [at time of the interview] ago, there was hardly any development environment to test changes. Most changes were done straight on the production environment. Typing this made me throw up in my mouth.<br><br>
The guy who interviewed me was very friendly, but I felt like a psychiatrist more than a job candidate. The dude went on about how shitty the atmosphere is at the offices, and what he told me about Mark seems to be spot on from what OP has said.<br><br>
Interview guy, if you read this, sorry yo.<br><br>

For anybody who does know what this means, it basically means when they make changes to the code of their website they don't put it on a test server and test it first. They put it live right away on the website.<br><br>
When you make changes to code no matter how trivial they are it's always best practice to test them on a "test server" before going live because a small mistake can break many things causing lots of problems.<br><br>
The fact that they have a bitcoin exchange without testing all changes before going live is... well, insane. <br><br>

If you are for real, that is FUCKING TERRIFYING, considering the amount of money that goes through that place. Glad I got out and switched to BTC-E several months ago...<br><br><br>
