			<div class="content">As The Times Herald Record reported in June of 1991: “The incidents [at the West Point Child Development Center] unfolded against a backdrop of satanic acts, animal sacrifices and cult-like behavior among the abusers, whose activities extended beyond the U.S. Military Academy borders to Orange County and a military base in San Francisco, parents charged.”<br>
<br>
The case first broke in July of 1984, when a three-year-old girl found herself in the emergency room of the West Point Hospital with a lacerated vagina. She told the examining physician that a teacher at the day care center had hurt her. The next month, the parents of another child leveled accusations of abuse at the center.<br>
<br>
As the Mercury News reported: “By the end of the year, 50 children had been interviewed by investigators. Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed.”<br>
<br>
Despite abundant medical and psychological evidence, and literally dozens of child witnesses, and despite “950 interviews by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation, an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani produced no federal grand jury indictments,” according to the Herald Record.<br>
<br>
The Herald also noted that: “In 1987, Giuliani said his detailed investigation showed only one or two children were abused.” This was, it should be noted, a bare-faced lie from the fascistic future-mayor and would-be Senator, as the Herald report divulged: “a still-secret, independent report - produced by one of the nation's top experts on child sexual abuse - confirms the children's accusations of abuse.”<br>
<br>
This was not the first time that the prestigious academy had shown an appalling willingness to overlook extreme levels of abuse directed at children by army personnel. A year before the abuse case broke, a 22-month-old child was murdered by an Army staff sergeant. The Mercury News reported that: “After a court martial hearing, the sergeant was given an 18 month suspended sentence and dishonorable discharge.”<br>
<br>
In other words, he served no time and was essentially given a free ride for murdering a child. With help from Giuliani, the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the grand jury, the abusers of countless children at the day care center (which was, appropriately enough, building number 666 on the academy grounds) were likewise given a free ride<br>

The layout had a tunnel <br>

Their findings <br>
<br>

<br>
Jews wrote dozens of articles about how the McMartin Preschool case was a total hoax. And it was a Jewish prosecutor who dropped 90% of the McMartin charges, for no reason, letting 80% of the pedo ring free without trial. A future mayor of LA was one of the suspects ID'd by the kids. His father was the top councilman in LA for decades. They named a big park after the father. The son who became mayor, the first thing he did is hire a Kroll Inc/CIA man to be chief of LAPD. And the Jew prosecutor of the McMartin trial had deep ties to that future mayor.<br>
<br>
"One recent witness, a 10-year-old boy who was the ninth of the 41 children scheduled to testify at the hearing, astonished courtroom observers when he identified photographs of James Hahn, the newly elected Los Angeles city attorney, and Chuck Norris, the motion-picture actor, as among those who had abused him. (Embarrassed prosecutors later acknowledged that the boy had been ''mistaken in his recollections.'')<br>
<br>
The boy also said children were beaten regularly at the McMartin school with a 10-foot-long bullwhip, forced to exhume bodies and taken to a church where they were slapped by a priest if they refused to pray to ''three or four gods.''<br>
<br>
''This is killing the prosecution,'' one of the seven defense lawyers said later, and even within the district attorneys office there are some who fear he may be right. All of those associated with the case say they are convinced beyond a doubt that the childrens fundamental allegations of sexual abuse are true, and they point to a growing body of research showing that preschool-age children almost never fabricate such accusations."<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-05-17-8501310192-story.html" class="postlink">https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- ... story.html</a> <br>
<br>
The FBI concluded there were tunnels leading to a neighboring house under McMartin preschool. Tunnels kids had described travelling through while being moved from the school. A child's Disney backpack as well as a plastic plate with pentagrams drawn on it were found too. A classroom connecting to the tunnel had no doorknob, only a deadbolt, and the fire alarms didn't connect to the firestation but was believed to have been used as an alert within the school. <br>

<br>
McMartin Preschool underground tunnels, animal bones, pentagrams, etc. confirmed by the declassified FBI documents (“The Finders Part 01 of 03” p. 48-49)<br>
<br>
I recall the TV movie portraying the kids as liars. I remember thinking, who would believe paid actors? <br>

Then there's Rudy Guliani. He's so corrupt, he wouldn't charge (((Susan Rosenberg))) for her role in an armed truck robbery that left two dead. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Because federal prosecutors in New York’s Southern District under then U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani decided that they would not pursue charges for her alleged part in the Brink’s armored car robbery, Rosenberg and her lawyers have ceaselessly argued for more than two decades that the lack of a conviction is tantamount to proof of her innocence. But Justice Department officials, led by future U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, a Democrat, insisted that they had evidence Rosenberg was also involved in the 1981 robbery bloodbath. They testified to that effect every time Rosenberg had a parole hearing.</div></blockquote>
