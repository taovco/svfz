<blockquote class="uncited"><div>South Australian Senator Alex Antic was taken into hotel quarantine under police escort in Adelaide on Thursday night.

The senator was asked by ABC Radio Adelaide on Friday why he was taken to a hotel to quarantine for two weeks to which he responded:<br>
<br>
    “That’s a very good question.<br>
<br>
    I’ve been a person who has been very, very vocal about mandates, vaccine passports, discrimination, government overreach and bureaucratic overreach.<br>
<br>
    Now all of a sudden I seem to have been singled out in what appears to be a political stunt and the only inference you can really draw from this is this has been quite premeditated.<br>

    My wife and my three-month-child are now at home for another two weeks without me.”<br>
<br>
Scott Morrison has revealed he was “surprised” that Antic was detained and locked up in a medi-hotel for the unvaccinated on Thursday night because he believed he had been doubled vaccinated.<br>
<br>
    “It was certainly my understanding that he’d been double vaccinated. And I had discussed vaccinations and made it very clear that that’s what I understood him to be, double vaccinated. So I was surprised</div></blockquote></div>

That's definitely a possibility. Or it could be theater for the politicians, in order to keep them in line, and he's in on it. There's probably enough pedo materiel on most of them to keep them in line anyway.</div>
