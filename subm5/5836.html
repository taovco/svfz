 [+] TheBuddha [OP] • 9 pts yesterday <br>
<br>
It is with a heavy heart that I must make this announcement. On Tuesday, at approximately 11:30 PM, COF (aka CynicalOldFart) lost his battle with cancer. He went peacefully in his sleep, with the hours leading up to it being surrounded by family. He'd been suffering for quite a while, steadily declining to the point where lucidity was impossible. He was heavily medicated and comfortable in his passing, if you need a reason to be optimistic.<br>
<br>
There were two big loves in COF's life, family and music. The two would even overlap from time to time. As his passage grew closer, I'd share tracks with his family to share with him. He appreciated music and family until the end. I'll be making a donation to a nearby school's music program on his behalf - or at least anonymously. If you'd like to contribute to that, just let me know. Otherwise, I have it covered. Having interacted a bit with his family, he has been well looked after.<br>
<br>
His contributions to the thread weren't immediate. It took some encouragement to get him to take part in the threads, as he didn't think he had anything to add. Lo and behold, he had plenty to add. His continued insights, knowledge of music and music history, and his archivist works were appreciated by all. Fortunately, Crazy will continue the archives that COF started. But, once COF got started doing something, he was committed to doing so.<br>
<br>
COF was quite fond of Biff and I. We often spent hours typing back and forth. What we shared was a true friendship. So, let's try to keep in mind that there's a person behind each and every one of these accounts - especially during the holiday season. We'll miss our daily interactions, as I'm sure others will.<br>
<br>
We'd spoken about how the guitar thread had lost some steam and I spoke to him about resigning from the thread. He was a bit disappointed and really wanted the thread to go on. He felt the thread was an important candlelight in the darkness that is the web. So, with that in mind, let's go ahead and have a thread - and let's go ahead and celebrate. Drink and smoke 'em if you got 'em. Share in the music and dance like nobody is watching. That's what COF would have wanted.<br>
<br>
I've had a hectic past couple of months and we barely got this year's track ready in time. I've typed enough, so let's start with the music already! Have another TSO cover!<br>

This was the first song I ever submitted, COF sent me a pm after I did. He called me a child of the 60's and he was right. He loved this song and thanked me for submitting it. Great guy and a music lover. You will be missed. Rip bud.<br>

What a coincidence, I used this song in a memorial video I did for a funeral a few years ago. It's very powerful. Not a dry eye in the joint.</div>
