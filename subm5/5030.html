<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Members of California’s biggest teachers union plotted how to push LGBT politics on children and undermine concerns about their tactics from parents, principals, and communities, reveals leaked audio from an October conference of the California Teachers Association (CTA).<br>
<br>
“Speakers went so far as to tout their surveillance of students’ Google searches, internet activity, and hallway conversations in order to target sixth graders for personal invitations to LGBTQ clubs, while actively concealing these clubs’ membership rolls from participants’ parents,” Abigail Shrier reported on Thursday.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Three people from the “2021 LGBTQ+ Issues Conference” in Palm Springs, Calif., titled “Beyond the Binary: Identity &amp; Imagining Possibilities,” sent recordings to Shrier revealing the radical content of some of the workshops.<br>
<br>
Multiple seminars at the conference encouraged hosting LGBT clubs for middle schoolers. An audio clip reveals teacher Lori Caldeira explaining why such clubs keep no rosters, noting, “Sometimes we don’t really want to keep records because if parents get upset that their kids are coming? We’re like, ‘Yeah, I don’t know. Maybe they came?’ You know, we would never want a kid to get in trouble for attending if their parents are upset.”<br>
<br>
Caldeira has noted in a separate podcast appearance that, in the club she runs that includes other people’s prepubescent minors, “What happens in this room, stays in this room.”</div></blockquote>

This is nothing new, as the Alphabet String community and Marxists have always targeted kids, whether for sexual 'development' reasons or to further Progressive Marxist politics (or both), but it's extra creepy level of perversion politics for teachers to systematically spy on all the kids in order to recruit many of them into radical highly sexualized 'school' groups, purposely out of reach of parental knowledge/consent.<br>
<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>“When we were doing our virtual learning – we totally stalked what they were doing on Google, when they weren’t doing school work. One of them was googling ‘Trans Day of Visibility.’ And we’re like ‘check.’ We’re going to invite that kid when we get back on campus,” Baraki admitted. “Whenever they follow the Google Doodle links or whatever, right, we make note of those kids and the things that they bring up with each other in chats or email or whatever.”<br>
<br>
Caldeira also acknowledged that she leverages her role of running morning announcements to further push LGBT ideology on children and their families.<br>
<br>
“I’m the one who controls the messaging. Everybody says, ‘Oh, Ms. Caldeira, you’re so sweet, you volunteered to do that.’ Of course I’m so sweet that I volunteered to do that. Because then I control the information that goes home,” she says in one of the recordings. “And for the first time, this year, students have been allowed to put openly LGBT content into our morning announcement slides.”</div></blockquote>
