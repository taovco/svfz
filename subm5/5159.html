<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Spontaneous Abortions and Policies on COVID-19 <br>
mRNA Vaccine Use During Pregnancy</span><br>
<br>
 by Dr Aleisha Brock Ph.D., MVS, BSc. Whanganui, New Zealand. E-mail: <a href="mailto:aleisharbrock@protonmail.com">aleisharbrockprotonmail.com</a> and Dr Simon Thornley Ph.D., MPH(Hons), MBChB. Senior Lecturer, Section of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, The <br>
University of Auckland, Park Rd, Grafton, New Zealand. E-mail: <a href="mailto:s.thornley@auckland.ac.nz">s.thornleyauckland.ac.nz</a><br>
<br>
Excerpts:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The use of mRNA vaccines in pregnancy is now generally considered safe for protection against <br>
COVID-19 in countries such as New Zealand, USA, and Australia. However, the influential CDC-<br>
sponsored article by Shimabukuro et al. (2021) used to support this idea, on closer inspection, provides <br>
little assurance, particularly for those exposed in early pregnancy. The study presents falsely reassuring <br>
statistics related to the risk of spontaneous abortion in early pregnancy, since the majority of women in <br>
the calculation were exposed to the mRNA product after the outcome period was defined (20 weeks’ <br>
gestation).<br>
  <br>
In this article, we draw attention to these errors and recalculate the risk of this outcome based on the <br>
cohort that was exposed to the vaccine before 20 weeks’ gestation. Our re-analysis indicates a <br>
cumulative incidence of spontaneous abortion 7 to 8 times higher than the original authors’ results  <br>
(p &lt; 0.001) and the typical average for pregnancy loss during this time period. In light of these findings, <br>
key policy decisions have been made using unreliable and questionable data. We conclude that the <br>
claims made using these data on the safety of exposure of women in early pregnancy to mRNA-based <br>
vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are unwarranted and recommend that those policy decisions be <br>
revisited.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The use of mRNA vaccines in pregnancy are <br>
reported as being safe for pregnant women and their <br>
unborn  child(ren)  for  protection  against  COVID-<br>
19, in countries such as New Zealand,[1] USA,[2] <br>
and Australia.[3] However, the article by <br>
Shimabukuro  et  al.  (2021)[4]  used  to  support  this <br>
idea, on closer inspection, provides little assurance, <br>
particularly for women exposed in early pregnancy. <br>
Here,  we  outline  these  concerns  and  question  the <br>
unrestricted use of these vaccines in pregnant women.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>However, closer inspection of the 827 women in <br>
the  denominator  of  this  calculation  reveals  that <br>
between  700  to  713  women  were  exposed  to  the <br>
vaccine after the timeframe for recording the <br>
outcome had elapsed (up to 20 weeks of <br>
pregnancy).  Hence,  a  re-analysis  of  these  figures <br>
indicates  a  cumulative  incidence  of  spontaneous <br>
abortion ranging from 82% (104/127) to 91% <br>
(104/114), 7–8 times higher than the original <br>
authors’ results. 
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Transmission of mRNA and spike protein <br>
The transmission of mRNA and spike protein <br>
across  the  placenta  and  through  breast  milk  is  of <br>
concern, given the unknown effect on development <br>
in utero or on a breastfeeding infant. There were no <br>
mRNA spike-encoding region amplifications <br>
detected in aqueous or liquid breast milk fractions <br>
0–7 days post-vaccination (n=5) in a study carried <br>
out by Mattar et al. in 15 pregnant women and five <br>
breast-feeding  women  who  received  one  Pfizer-<br>
BioNTech  (BNT162B2)  mRNA  vaccination.[25] <br>
However,  the  presence  of  spike  protein  itself  was <br>
not tested for. The authors of this study urge <br>
caution,  given  the  small  sample  sizes  and  study <br>
duration of only one week post-exposure. In <br>
contrast  to  this  study,  voluntary  reporting  systems <br>
such as VAERS have received numerous reports of <br>
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), <br>
gastrointestinal  upset,  rash,  anaphylactic  reaction <br>
and  death  (for  example,  VAERS  ID26:  1166062; <br>
927664; 939409; 954010; 1166062; 1224688; <br>
1254975;  1272428;  1343886;  1395088;  1415059; <br>
1445743;  1031318;  1113464;  1182232)  following exposure  to  breastmilk  of  a  recently  vaccinated <br>
mother. </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> <br>
Conclusion <br>
 <br>
We question the conclusions of the Shimabukuro et <br>
al.[4] study to support the use of the mRNA vaccine <br>
in  early  pregnancy,  which  has  now  been  hastily <br>
incorporated into many international guidelines for <br>
vaccine  use,  including  in  New  Zealand.[1]  The <br>
assumption  that  exposure  in  the  third  trimester <br>
cohort  is  representative  of  the  effect  of  exposure <br>
throughout  pregnancy  is  questionable  and  ignores <br>
past experience with drugs such as thalidomide.[38] <br>
Evidence of safety of the product when used in the <br>
first  and  second  trimesters  cannot  be  established <br>
until these cohorts have been followed to at least the <br>
perinatal period or long-term safety determined for <br>
any of the babies born to mothers inoculated during <br>
pregnancy. Additionally, the product’s manufacturer, <br>
Pfizer, contradicts these assurances, stating: <br>
“available  data  on  Comirnaty  administered to <br>
pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-<br>
associated risks in pregnancy”, and “it is not known <br>
whether Comirnaty is excreted in human milk” as <br>
“data  are  not  available  to  assess  the  effects  of <br>
Comirnaty on the breastfed infant” (page 14).[39] <br>
Due to the nature of the mRNA vaccine roll-out, <br>
healthcare  providers  need  to  report  any  issues  in <br>
pregnancy  to  further  determine  the  safety  of  this <br>
product. Caution should be exercised in the <br>
administration of vaccines in pregnancy, as <br>
indicated  by  the  possible  association  between  the <br>
exposure to influenza vaccines containing <br>
H1N1pdm09 (2010–11 and 2011–12) and <br>
spontaneous abortion.[40] Considering the <br>
evidence presented here, we suggest the immediate <br>
withdrawal of mRNA vaccine use in pregnancy <br>
(Category X)[41] and those breastfeeding, <br>
alongside  the  withdrawal  of  mRNA  vaccines  to <br>
children  or  those  of  child-bearing  age  in  the <br>
general  population,  until  more  convincing  data <br>
relating  to  the  safety  and  long-term  impacts  on <br>
fertility, pregnancy and reproduction are established in these groups. </div></blockquote></div>
