<strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">Between April and July of 2020, John Griffin - who worked on the CNN show New Day, allegedly used online messaging applications to communicate with the purported parents of minor daughters, according to a Vermont grand jury indictment.</em></strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The 44-year-old CNN producer from Stamford CT, who worked 'shoulder to shoulder' with Chris Cuomo according to the Daily Mail, 'used Google Hangouts and Kik to convince the mothers that a "woman is a woman regardless of her age," and that "women should be sexually subservient and inferior to men," according to a Friday indictment.<br>
<br>
    In June of 2020, Griffin advised a mother of 9- and 13-year-old daughters that the mother’s responsibility was to see that her older daughter was “trained properly.”  Griffin later transferred over $3,000 to the mother for plane tickets so the mother and her 9-year-old daughter could fly from Nevada to Boston’s Logan airport.  The mother and child flew to Boston in July of 2020, where Griffin picked them up in his Tesla and drove them to his Ludlow house.  At the house, the daughter was directed to engage in, and did engage in, unlawful sexual activity.  <br>
<br>
Griffin also allegedly attempted to entice two other children over the internet to engage in sexual activity - proposing a "virtual training session" in a video chat in April 2020 which would involve instructing a mother and her 14-year-old daughter to get naked and touch each other at his direction. <br>
<br>
In June 2020, Griffin proposed to the purported mother of a 16-year-old that she take a "little mother-daughter trip" to his ski house for sexual training involving the minor.<br>

Griffin faces 10 years to life in prison if convicted on each federal count.<br>
<br>
"We take the charges against Mr. Griffin incredibly seriously," a CNN spokesperson told the Mail on Friday. "We only learned of his arrest this afternoon and have suspended him pending investigation."<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A CNN employee has been charged on Friday accused of luring a mother and her young daughter to come his home to 'train' her to be sexually submissive. <br>
<br>
John Griffin, who worked on the CNN show New Day, was charged with three counts that he used a 'facility of interstate commerce to abuse underage girls.' <br>
<br>
A Vermont grand jury indicted 44-year-old Griffin, from Stamford, Connecticut of attempting to entice the girls to engage in sexual activity.  <br>
<br>
'According to the indictment, between April and July of 2020, Griffin utilized the messaging applications Kik and Google Hangouts to communicate with people purporting to be parents of minor daughters, conveying to them, among other ideas, that a 'woman is a woman regardless of her age,' and that women should be sexually subservient and inferior to men,' according to a statement from the Department of Justice on the case.<br>
<br>
The statement goes on to state that he 'attempted to entice two other children over the internet to engage in sexual activity.'<br>
<br>
In the communications, Griffin is said to have tried to persuade parents to let him train their daughters to be sexually submissive toward men. <br>
<br>
In June 2020, Griffin told a mom of two girls, aged 9 and 13 that she needed to have her daughters 'trained properly.'<br>
<br>
Griffin is alleged to have sent her $3,000 in order to pay for plane tickets so that she could travel with her daughters from Nevada to Boston, according to the indictment. <br>
<br>
After the trio flew to Boston, Griffin collected them at the airport before driving them to his home in Ludlow, Vermont.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Prosecutors say the girl was forced to engage in illegal sexual contact.</span><br>
<br>
Other allegations in the indictment detail how Griffin allegedly tried to entice two other children online in order to participate in sexual activity.<br>
<br>
In April 2020, Griffin coordinated a 'virtual training session' in which he instructed a woman and her 14-year-old daughter to remove their clothes during a video chat.<br>
<br>
Two months later, in June 2020, prosecutors claim Griffin offered to pay for a woman and her 16-year-old daughter to come to his ski house in Vermont for sexual 'training' involving the teen. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Griffin is then said to have mentioned how he 'sexually trained girls as young as 7 years old,' according to the indictment.</span><br>
<br>
Griffin faces 10 years to life in prison if convicted on each federal count. <br>
<br>
'We take the charges against Mr. Griffin incredibly seriously,' a CNN spokesperson said on Friday. 'We only learned of his arrest this afternoon and have suspended him pending investigation.'<br>
<br>
Griffin began working with CNN in 2013, working on New Day when Chris Cuomo was its host. <br>
<br>
His most recently role saw him acting as a producer for CNN senior political analyst John Avlon. </div></blockquote></div>

"CNN is the main Enabling  MedIa Voice of Covering Up Pediphilia. I have emails where I networked with Anchors in 2014 and a Reporter told me they are not allowed to expose the pandemic but what they do is feature the fake Advocates &amp; Phony Charities that drive victims into the arms of their captors to increase their charity profiles so that they drive the the public the traffickers . These operations who can then contact their MK Ultra networks so the teams come in and Handle the crisis situation by blackmail &amp; bribing all around a victim then put them in rolls as handlers for the Squeeky family member.  The most affluent middle class and upper middle class families got there after covering up another family members molestations. <br>
<br>
THIS I KNOW PERSONALLY! <br>
<br>
CNN IS WHO HOSTS AND PROMOTES THE WITCH ANGELA WILLIAMS OF VOICE TODAY WHO WAS THE MAIN GASLIGHTER FOR SEX ABUSED KIDS IN GA. There is a huge list and they meet at the Children &amp; Family conference each year in Augusta GA. This children  &amp; Family conference began under the Perdue Political Dynasty with Sonny Perdue. Unsure if he knew what it would morph into but annually they plot their ways to navigate sex abuse to minors secretly. Angela Williams ran Voice Today before they changed names after I exposed them. Watch here many interviews with CNN Christie Paul who would MC her charity Events.  <br>
<br>
CNN &amp; ATLANTA GA IS THE MOST EVIL COLLABIRATION FOR CHILD SEX ABUSE!!!!"<br>

what takes the law so long in arresting these people????????????<br>

</div></blockquote>

Amongst honest cops, the main reason revolves around the 5th/6th amendment of the Bill of Rights.<br>
<br>
Via the “No Double Jeapordy” clause, the law gets ONE shot to bust a criminal under X charges.<br>
<br>
Meaning that the evidence collected must be absolutely air tight to prevent even technicalities from letting the culprit off.<br>
<br>
That other stuff…is that personal witness testimony you have?<br>
<br>
Because if that is YOUR personal eye witness testimony regarding “their” crimes, we allow that under submission rules. Just have a relevant link about the subject, then add in your account of what you witnessed.</div>

Reading all of the stuff this producer said such as the “all females are wanton whores”, “mega sluts”, etc…this sounds exactly like the view points of scum like Donkeyhote. <br>
