How to Remove Graphene Oxide From the Body<br>
<br>
Graphene oxide, a substance that is poisonous to humans has been found in the Covid 19 “vaccines”, in the water supply, in the air we breath through chemtrails, and is even in our food supply.  Graphene oxide interacts and is activated by electromagnetic frequency’s (EMF), specifically the broader range of frequencies found in 5G which can cause even more damage to our health.<br>
<br>
The symptoms of graphene oxide poisoning and EMF radiation sickness are similar to those symptoms described as Covid. The good news is, now that graphene oxide has been identified as a contaminant, there are ways to remove graphene oxide from our bodies and restore your health.<br>
<br>
This is a holistic approach of using several different methods simultaneously for the best effect. Including, specific supplements to degrade the graphene oxide in the body, and controlling EMF’s in the environment to minimize graphene oxide activation.<br>
This information comes from several sources and is based on scientific studies. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding glutathione.<br>
<br>
Glutathione is a substance made from the amino acids glycine, cysteine, and glutamic acid. It is produced naturally by the liver and involved in many processes in the body, including tissue building and repair, making chemicals and proteins needed in the body, and for the immune system.  We have a natural glutathione reserve in our bodies. <br>
This is what gives us a strong immune system.<br>
<br>
When glutathione levels are high in the body we have no problems and our immune system functions well. But when the amount of graphene oxide in the body exceeds the amount of glutathione, it causes the collapse of the immune system and triggers a cytokine storm. The way that graphene oxide can rapidly grow to exceed glutathione in <br>
the body is by electronic excitation.  Meaning, EMF’s that bombard the graphene to oxidize it, which rapidly triggers the disease.<br>
<br>
At the age of 65 glutathione levels fall drastically in the body. This can explain why the population most affected by Covid-19 are the elderly. Glutathione levels are also very low in people with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, etc.  Likewise, glutathione levels are very high in infants, children and athletes. This can explain why Covid-19 has not affected these people.<br>
<br>
Graphene oxide when oxidized or activated by specific EMF frequencies overruns the body’s ability to create enough glutathione, which destroys the immune system and causes the illness.  In events of illness (such as Covid symptoms and all the “variants”) it is necessary to raise glutathione levels in the body in order to cope with the toxin (graphene oxide) that has been introduced or electrically activated.<br>
<br>
 <br>
ICU Intubated Covid Patients Healed Within Hours When Treated with Glutathione and NAC<br>
Example from Dr. Ricardo Delgado<br>
<br>
“We have seen clinical trials with hundreds of patients who were in the ICU, on a respirator and intubated, practically on the verge of death. With bilateral pneumonias caused by the spread of graphene oxide and subsequent 5G radiation in the lung plaques. Well, this diffuse stain in these patients is symmetrical, which would not happen with a biological agent since it would be rather asymmetrical, as for example when there is a pneumococcal infection, right? Well, in that case a diffuse stain usually appears in one part of the lung, but not in another, not in both symmetrically. So when treated with glutathione via direct intravenous —or even orally as well— or with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 600 mg or higher doses, people within hours began to recover their oxygen saturation” -Dr. Ricardo Delgado  <a href="https://www.orwell.city/2021/07/NAC-glutathione.html" class="postlink">https://www.orwell.city/2021/07/NAC-glutathione.html</a> <br>
<br>
N-acetylcysteine or “NAC” is a supplement that causes the body to produce glutathione, it is known as the precursor to glutathione and causes the body to secrete glutathione endogenously, just as it does when you do sports intensely.  N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) comes from the amino acid L-cysteine and is used by the body to build antioxidants. Antioxidants are vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells from damage. You can get NAC as a supplement or a prescription drug.<br>
<br>
Zinc in combination with NAC  are essential antioxidants used to degrade graphene oxide. Dr. Ricardo Delgado states that with these two antioxidants he has personally helped people affected by magnetism after inoculation.  This is in people with two doses of Pfizer who have become magnetic and after these supplements they no longer have this symptom.<br>
<br>
Other supplements that can be taken to assist in the removal of graphene oxide are:<br>
Astaxanthin<br>
Melatonin<br>
Milk Thistle<br>
Quercetin<br>
Vitamin C<br>
Vitamin D3<br>
<br>
