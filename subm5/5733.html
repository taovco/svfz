<blockquote class="uncited"><div>At the same time, I also registered Centre Chretien de l'Enfant Haitien (also known as CCEH) here in Virginia in an effort to raise awareness for our organization in the US and abroad. A portion of the revenue generated through MG Productions helps fund the work of CCEH by helping to secure shelter, food and quality of life for the kids in Haiti. We actively provided relief for the Haitian Community in the South during hurricane Matthew.<br>

I have been very active in my community of <span style="color:#FF0040">Lynchburg Virginia</span>. I have actively work in the revitalization efforts of downtown Lynchburg and in promoting Arts &amp; Culture. In 2016, I received the Vice Mayor's Award of Excellence for my contribution to the city of Lynchburg.<br>

Marc-Arthur Aristilde is a Haitian friend that I met while attending Liberty University. He went on to become a truck driver in the US. When he got into an accident, he lost his contract and was down on his luck with nowhere to stay. I opened my doors to him and offered him a place to stay until he could get back on his feet. Throughout this time, he decided to register a trucking company under my address since he was living here. With the thought that one day he could secure his own load and work for himself, that dream never came to fruition. He now works at a local distribution center.</div></blockquote>

I came across it again because I was looking at the Haitian charity Beyond Borders again, the one opposite Comet Ping Pong.. and they have major connections to the University of <span style="color:#FF0040">Lynchburg</span> . So.. given what I've since learnt about trucking and trafficking .. I went looking further..<br>
<br>
Marc-Arthur Aristilde became a freight agent for Truckalocity <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-arthur-aristilde-78628a125/" class="postlink">https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-arthur ... 78628a125/</a>#<br>
