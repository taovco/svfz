Gates, Fauci, and Daszak charged with Genocide in Court Filing<br>
<br>
In a stunning 46-page legal filing to the International Criminal Court on December 6, an intrepid attorney and seven applicants accused Anthony Fauci, Peter Daszak, Melinda Gates, William Gates III, and twelve others of numerous violations of the Nuremberg Code.<br>
<br>
<br>
and war crimes as defined by the Rome Statutes, Articles 6, 7, 8, 15, 21, and 53.<br>

Klaus Schwab, a wickedly intelligent, perhaps diabolical German with double doctorate degrees in Economics and Engineering, is the founder of the World Economic Forum, a club for the wealthiest percentile of the world’s corporate and political elite. He is a power broker who has groomed many presidents, prime ministers, and <br>
tech CEOs who now view him with reverence and unswerving loyalty.<br>
<br>
Schwab, an economist, and technocrat has befriended many nations, most significantly China’s Xi Jinping, who delivered a key speech at Davos. He praised his vision of a New World Order. On January 25, 2021, Klaus Schwab vowed his support for Xi Jinping with these words, “Mr. President (Xi Jinping) I believe this is the best time to reset our policies and to work, jointly, for a peaceful and prosperous world. We all welcome now, his excellency, <br>
Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China.” See mark 2:26.<br>

Many consider Schwab the mastermind behind the current movement towards cryptocurrency, universal identification, and a one-world (fascist) government to be run jointly, in totalitarian fashion, with China.<br>

Attorney Hannah Rose and seven applicants brought the Nuremberg action on behalf of the victims, the entire population of the United Kingdom. She filed the legal proceeding with the International Criminal Court located at The Hague. The Hague is notable for its long history in helping victims seek redress for war crimes and defining appropriate ethical guidelines for conduct during war.<br>
<br>
Following the Nazi atrocities committed during World War II, the war crime trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany. Following these, a set of principles was developed, which ultimately led to the development of the Nuremberg Code.<br>
<br>
These principles essentially meant that anyone, no matter how wealthy or powerful, even a head of state, was not above the law. The fact that the law of their home nation would permit their action would not relieve the person from justice under international law.<br>
<br>
In particular, the medical experiments conducted by the Nazi doctors led to strict rules and ethical principles regarding future human scientific trials, including the doctrine of necessary informed consent and freedom from coercion or threat in submitting to experimental drugs.<br>
<br>
As we all know, before receiving a surgical procedure, there is a legal and ethical requirement that the patient be apprised of any significant potential risks, including infection, bleeding, nerve damage, or even death. The patient usually signs the consent form following this explanation. And as we all know, whenever we receive prescription medication, we are notified of the potential risks on a package insert and usually a discussion with the Pharmacist.<br>
<br>
The vaccines should be no different, yet they are. A person about to receive the jab is rarely told that there are risks of blood clots, bleeding, cerebral thrombosis, myocarditis, and death, yet those risks exist. See mark 12:58 to 17:40.<br>

<br>
Attorney Hannah Rose notes in Point 40 of her brief that the ethical standards of the Nuremberg Code amount to an obligation on physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers to abide by its principles. Accordingly, any physician or research scientist found to have breached any of the ten principles of the Nuremberg Code would face criminal liability.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw" class="postlink">https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw</a><br>
<br>
She notes in Point 42, “The first principle of the Nuremberg Code is a willingness and informed consent by the person to receive treatment and participate in an experiment. The person is supposed to activate freedom of choice without the intervention, either through force, deceit, fraud, threat, solicitation, or any other type of binding or coercion.” <br>
<br>
<a href="https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw" class="postlink">https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw</a><br>
<br>
In Point 43 she argues, “When the heads of the Ministry of Health as well as the Prime Minister presented the vaccine in the United Kingdom and began the vaccination of United Kingdom residents, the vaccinated  were not advised, that in practice, they would be taking part in a medical experiment and that their consent is required under the Nuremberg Code. This as a matter of fact is a genetic medical experiment on human beings performed without informed consent under a severe and blatant offense of the Nuremberg Code.”<br>
<br>
In addition, Rose argues under Point 44 that there is an obligation for alternative treatments to be discussed, including the risks and benefits of such alternatives.  She notes that these were never discussed despite the fact alternative treatments have been proven to be safe and effective “with up to a 100% success rate.” <br>

<br>
A key principle of the Nuremberg Code requires that a scientist must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill, and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.<br>

<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nuremberg-code#permissible-medical-experiments-1" class="postlink">https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/ ... eriments-1</a><br>
<br>
In Point 46, she argues, “It is known that the mRNA ‘vaccination’ treatments have caused the death of many as well as injury and severe damage (including disablement and paralysis) after the ‘vaccine’ was administered. Despite this fact, the government did not instruct the initiation of an investigation into the matter. It is also questionable that given the experimental nature of these vaccinations, that there are not any full reports available of the numbers of dead or injured, as may be expected in such a medical process for the benefit of the public participating in the experiment.”<br>
<br>

<br>
The reader is reminded that Nazi physicians conducted experiments on human beings in concentration camps without informed consent, leading to horrific suffering and death. <br>

<br>
To dramatically underscore the relevance of Nuremberg to the horrific deaths we now see related to the experimental mRNA ‘vaccination’ program, Rose, in Point 34a, included a statement from a group of Holocaust survivors, those who experienced first-hand both the Nazi experiments and today the vaccine experiment. This is an excerpt from their unique perspective: <br>
<br>
We, the survivors of the atrocities committed against humanity during the Second World War, feel bound to follow our conscience…Another holocaust of greater magnitude is taking place before our eyes. We call upon you to stop this ungodly medical experiment on humankind immediately. It is a medical experiment to which the Nuremberg Code must be applied.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw" class="postlink">https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw</a><br>
<br>
Holocaust survivor Vera Sharav issued a statement in Points 34b and 34c:<br>
<br>
The stark lesson of the Holocaust is that whenever doctors join forces with government and deviate from their personal, professional, clinical commitment to do no harm to the individual, medicine can then be perverted from a healing, humanitarian profession to a murderous apparatus…What sets the Holocaust apart from all other mass genocides is the pivotal role played by the medical establishment, the entire medical establishment. Every step of the murderous process was endorsed by the academic, professional medical establishment.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw" class="postlink">https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw</a><br>
<br>
As a direct result of the Nuremberg World War II experience, the United Nations asked the International Law Commission to develop the Nuremberg Principles, the key standards  to avoid the Nazi doctors' atrocities. Unfortunately, as Hannah Rose pointed out, many of these ten principles of the Nuremberg Code were systematically violated by the United Kingdom and many other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nuremberg-code#permissible-medical-experiments-1" class="postlink">https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/ ... eriments-1</a><br>
International Criminal Court<br>
<br>
International Criminal Court<br>
<br>
In addition, a permanent international criminal court was established for investigation and enforcement - known as The International Criminal Court. The ICC began full-time operations in 2002 and currently has 123 member nations that have explicitly agreed to be bound by the Rome Statutes. <br>
<br>
The United Kingdom is a member while the United States is not. However, under article 12(3) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, even a state that is NOT a member may exercise jurisdiction "by declaration lodged with the Registrar," meaning that any nation may be subject to the ICC depending upon the circumstances, member nation or not. Keep in mind that Nazi Germany had not consented to jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
The ICC bills itself as a "court of last resort" meaning that claims should be decided in the perpetrator's home nation whenever possible. However, the core principle of impunity drives the ICC, the belief that no one who commits war crimes should enjoy freedom from criminal responsibility. Therefore, the ICC operates as an impartial and omnipotent arbiter of world human rights and will aggressively step in when it sees flagrant Nuremberg-type atrocities without consequence.<br>
<br>
That is precisely what Hannah Rose has identified in her legal brief in Point 2,<br>
<br>
"We have tried to raise this case through the English police and the English Court system without success, we have been unable even to get the case registered either with the police or with the court after several attempts...This is such a case which is why we are addressing the ICC directly."<br>
<br>
Attorney Rose relied partly upon the expertise of Dr. Michael Yeadon, a research-based PhD in respiratory pharmacology and former Vice President and Chief Scientist at Pfizer.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://rumble.com/vg4inv-michael-yeadon-full-interview-planet-lockdown.html" class="postlink">https://rumble.com/vg4inv-michael-yeado ... kdown.html</a><br>
<br>
In the background section of the brief, she writes in Point 5:<br>
<br>
"The Covid-19 ‘vaccines’ do not meet the requirement to be categorized as vaccines and are in fact gene therapy (Appendix 8)...Dr. Mike Yeadon, a joint applicant on this request, asserts that claims calling the Covid-19 injections a 'vaccine' is public manipulation and misrepresentation of clinical treatment.<br>
<br>
"It's not a vaccination. It's not prohibiting infection. It's not a prohibiting transmission device. It's a means by which your body is conscripted to make the toxin that then allegedly your body somehow gets used to dealing with it, but unlike a vaccine, which is to trigger the immune response, this is to trigger the creation of the toxin.' <br>
<br>
"MRNA uses the cell's machinery to synthesize proteins that are supposed to resemble the SPIKE protein of the virus, which is what it uses to enter cells via the ACE2 receptor. These proteins are then identified by the immune system, which builds antibodies against them. The real concern is that these proteins could accumulate in the body, especially in regions of high concentration of ACE2 receptors, such as the gonads. If the immune system then attacks the location where they accumulate, then you could be dealing with an auto-immune condition."<br>
<br>
<a href="https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw" class="postlink">https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw</a><br>
<br>
Dr. Yeadon mentions, in an interview, that our governments have grossly exaggerated the entire threat of COVID-19. He notes that COVID-19 represents a slightly greater risk than influenza if you are older than age 70 but a much lower risk than the seasonal flu if you are younger. See mark 31:00.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://rumble.com/vg4inv-michael-yeadon-full-interview-planet-lockdown.html" class="postlink">https://rumble.com/vg4inv-michael-yeado ... kdown.html</a><br>
<br>
"So it’s just absurd that you should be happy or willing to let your economy and civil society be smashed for something which represents for almost everyone working a lower risk than influenza - but that’s true," Yeadon said in the interview.<br>
<br>
"Given this virus represents at worst a slightly bigger risk to the old and ill than does influenza, and a less risk than for almost everyone else who’s younger and fit, it was NEVER NECESSARY for us to have done anything.<br>
<br>
"We didn't need to do anything, lockdowns, masks, mass testing, vaccines - there are multiple therapeutic drugs that are at least as effective as vaccines are...an off-patent drug called Ivermectin, one of the most widely used drugs in the world, is also able to reduce symptoms at any stage of the disease including lethality by about 90%. <br>

<br>
"So you don't need vaccines and you don't need any of the measures that have been introduced at all," Yeadon concluded. See mark 31:15. <br>

For any reader still under the illusion that these mRNA covid vaccines have helped, please read the following article comparing the countries without vaccination to those with it. The most vaccinated nations have deaths per million up to 100 x greater than the least. Always question what the government tells you.<br>

<br>
Yeadon goes on to explain that people need not worry about variants. He explains that our immune system is easily able to deal with ALL mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and explains that 18 years after the first SARS, those people are still protected by their immunity - and this immunity even extends to immunity against SARS-CoV-2, a virus 80% similar but 20% different than the original SARS.<br>
<br>
Yeadon's major point is that if survivors of SARS some 18 years later have immunity against the new virus, which is 20% different, why would we believe that a current viral mutant only 0.3% different would be a threat? See mark 35:40.<br>

<br>
"So when your government scientists say that a variant that’s 0.3% different from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should know, and I'm telling you, THEY ARE LYING. If they're lying and they are, why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up vaccines? They are making them," Yeadon said. See mark 35:55 <br>

<br>
"You should be terrified at this point. I am, because there is absolutely no possible justification for their manufacture. But they're being made, and the world's medicine regulators have said...we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies. Let me just say again, the variants are not different enough to represent a threat to you so you do not need top-up vaccines..., Yeadon said.<br>
<br>
"The regulators have waved them through. I'm very frightened of that - there's no possible benign interpretation of this. I believe they are going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you. Seriously. I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation.<br>
<br>
This will provide the tools to do it and plausible deniability - because they will create another story about some sort of biological threat, you'll line up and get your top-up vaccines, and a few months or a year or so later, you'll die of some peculiar, inexplicable syndrome, and they won't be able to associate it with the top-up vaccines." See mark 36:05 to 37:15.<br>

<a href="https://rumble.com/vg4inv-michael-yeadon-full-interview-planet-lockdown.html" class="postlink">https://rumble.com/vg4inv-michael-yeado ... kdown.html</a><br>
<br>
Yeadon follows this up with his conclusion, "This system (mandatory vaccine passports) is being put in place using lies, and it's being put in place for some purpose, and I believe that purpose is complete totalitarian control, and I think the purpose of that is going to be mass depopulation." See mark 45:40.<br>

<br>
"Do not allow it to be an interoperable global fixed-format database because that will be the end of human freedom, and I see no way of recovering from that once the system's up and running." See mark 46:30<br>

<br>
Yeadon explained that few people will hear his words and that this fraud was perpetrated on the world's population through censorship, fear and propaganda. Dr. Yeadon, an insightful man, notes that the perpetrators have exhaustively planned this all, and they have considered how people might respond. Yeadon notes that if we all respond as expected, we will lose.<br>
<br>
"Collectively, we need to do something unexpected." See mark 48:43.<br>

<br>
However, it is likely they didn't plan on the International Criminal Court coming after them. They also didn't plan on Dr. Reiner Fuellmich, an experienced trial lawyer licensed in Germany and California who founded the Berlin Corona Committee, which heads a group of attorneys with global reach dedicated to dragging this deadly conspiracy into the open and suing it into oblivion.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Corona-Investigative-Committee:5/Reiner-Fuellmich-Introduction-English_BestCut:e" class="postlink">https://odysee.com/@Corona-Investigativ ... _BestCut:e</a><br>
<br>
Fuellmich does an excellent job in this interview of exposing the actions of Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, WEF, also known as Davos. The WEF has as its goal the establishment of a New World Order, with the globe to be run by self-selected technocrats like Bill Gates, himself, and other members of Davos.<br>
<br>
In 1971 Schwab founded what was to become the WEF in 1987. It has 1,000 members. In general, qualification requires a business to have more than 5 billion dollars per year in revenue. The theme of WEF and Klaus Schwab has recently been "The Great Reset," which essentially means a new world order. In the following video, Klaus Schwab can be heard discussing this with Henry Kissinger. We hear Dr. Kissinger praising China’s Xi Jinping's speech and the formation of a new international order. See mark 2:50 to 4:00.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/Apjzjsa8AIg" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/Apjzjsa8AIg</a><br>
<br>
Schwab himself sums up the 2017 Davos Meeting with the following statement, "What  a wonderful opportunity to conclude our week here with such concrete proposals and ideas of how we can really create a New World Order." See mark 26:40.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/Apjzjsa8AIg" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/Apjzjsa8AIg</a><br>
<br>
Professor Andreas Oehler aptly describes the agenda of Schwab and the WEF, "The World Economic Forum seems to be the driver behind and organizer of the global population control operations, be it pandemics, biometric IDs, Great Reset, or public-private partnerships in name of the "common good" (fascist corporatism)." See the following article,  "The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse identified, along with the Apocalypse itself."<br>
<br>
<a href="https://live2fightanotherday.substack.com/" class="postlink">https://live2fightanotherday.substack.com/</a><br>
<br>
Professor Oehler of the University of Bamberg is widely published in credit, banking, finance, and investor protection. He believes that Klaus Schwab and his WEF members, including Bill Gates, planned the COVID-19 pandemic by sponsoring Event 201, a coronavirus pandemic simulation exercise held in New York City on October 18, 2019. WEF has been a proponent of digital biometric identity systems to make societies "more efficient and productive" (and easier to control).<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/" class="postlink">https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/</a><br>
<br>
Oehler wrote, "WEF collaborates with the ID2020 alliance, funded by the Gates and Rockefeller foundations to run a program to 'provide digital ID with vaccines.' In particular, ID2020 sees the vaccination of children as 'an entry point for digital identity.' In reality, this means that anything a person does or is allowed to do (employment, travel, commerce, health care...) will be linked to the person's digital ID. This will remove any privacy and take total control over each and every activity of any individual on earth."<br>
<br>
<a href="https://live2fightanotherday.substack.com/" class="postlink">https://live2fightanotherday.substack.com/</a><br>
<br>
For readers who may doubt this, read Klaus Schwab's book, The Great Reset. One of his chief goals is to have perfect monitoring ability of every human being and to be able to regulate all behavior, even to the point of complete totalitarian control.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/COVID-19-Great-Reset-Klaus-Schwab/dp/2940631123" class="postlink">https://www.amazon.com/COVID-19-Great-R ... 2940631123</a><br>
<br>
The WEF sees times of great turmoil or catastrophes as ideal opportunities to implement this reset, such as during the financial crisis of 2008, and now the COVID-19 pandemic, which Dr. Reiner Fuellmich feels created a perfect opportunity for the WEF to execute its plan. Fuellmich, a world-renowned trial attorney, refers to Schwab and his henchmen collectively as “Mr. Global.”<br>
<br>
"Klaus Schwab spells this out in his book, The Great Reset, and demands… a World Government under the UN, which has been brought under control by the WEF. This is to be achieved by creating as much worldwide chaos as possible in the form of pandemics, wars including civil wars and natural disasters so that the world population becomes convinced that the national governments are overwhelmed, and only a world government can help. <br>
<br>
At the same time, Schwab calls for the shifting of all wealth to Mr. Global so that in 2030, no one, except Mr. Global, will still own anything, and we will supposedly be happy with that. Cash is to be abolished and replaced by a digital currency.  This will be allocated to or taken away from every person in the world who can then also be found anywhere and at any time by various tracking systems. This is to be done by a single central world bank." See mark 32:45 to 33:56.<br>

<br>
Fuellmich and Oehler both describe a series of puppets that the WEF has trained to help carry out these missions under the WEF "Young Global Leader" program, which started in 1993. Such people have gone on to become Presidents, Prime Ministers, and CEOs. These include some of the key players in this pandemic and vaccination effort: <br>
<br>
    Microsoft founder Bill Gates (1993)<br>
    California Governor Gavin Newsom (selected in 2005)<br>
    Pete Buttigieg (selected in 2019, candidate for US President in 2020, US secretary of transportation since 2021)<br>
    Stéphane Bancel (Moderna CEO; selected in 2009)<br>
    Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg (2009)<br>
    Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (2007)<br>
    Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page (2002/2005)<br>
    Covid Twitter personality Eric Feigl-Ding (a ‘WEF Global Shaper‘ since 2013)<br>
    New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (since 2017, selected in 2014)<br>
    Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt (selected in 2003; former WEF strategy director)<br>
    Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland (selected in 2001; former managing director of Reuters)<br>
    Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is a WEF participant but is not a confirmed Young Global Leader <br>
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel (selected in 1993, 12 years before becoming Chancellor)<br>
    Current German Health Minister Jens Spahn and former Health Ministers Philipp Roesler and Daniel Bahr<br>
    EU Commission Presidents Jose Manuel Barroso (2004-2014, selected in 1993) and Jean-Claude Juncker (2014-2019, selected in 1995)<br>
    French President Emanuel Macron (since 2017, selected in 2016), <br>
    Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy (2007-2012, selected in 1993), <br>
    Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz<br>
    Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (2014-2016, selected in 2012), <br>
    Former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar (1996-2004, selected in 1993)<br>
    Dr. Ravid Shah, President of the Rockefeller Foundation<br>

<br>
When we notice the harsh authoritarian and mandatory lockdowns of Australia, Austria, and Canada, perhaps it begins to make better sense when we factor in the names of those in the WEF Young Global Leadership program. See mark 34:25 to 34:58.<br>
<br>

<br>
Now, against our seemingly hopeless situation, Reiner Fuellmich gives us all every reason to be optimistic:<br>
<br>
"Against this background, which increasingly more people are recognizing, very large legal disputes have been set in motion in India, South Africa, the US, Canada, and France. Their goal is to hold those responsible accountable under both civil and criminal law. This also includes that the assets that have been taken away by Mr. Global from the world's population...are returned...In particular, Anglo-American Law with its powerful tools of class action, pre-trial discovery, punitive damages...provides the tools for very effective justice." See mark 35:00.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Corona-Investigative-Committee:5/Reiner-Fuellmich-Introduction-English_BestCut:e" class="postlink">https://odysee.com/@Corona-Investigativ ... _BestCut:e</a><br>
<br>
Reiner mentions that he has developed very good evidence that the PCR test was fraudulently used to grossly exaggerate the number of true COVID cases and the courts in Portugal, Austria and Germany, have set excellent precedents in their rulings to that effect.<br>
<br>
Fuellmich concludes, "The Berlin Corona Committee already now has extremely incriminating  evidence proving that this Corona ‘plandemic’ NEVER had anything to do with health; rather Mr. Global’s actions are aimed solely at these goals:<br>
<br>
#1. Destruction of regional economies to make the population dependent on Mr. Global's global supply chains.<br>
<br>
#2. Shifting the wealth of the world's populations from the bottom to the top - to the super-rich - to Mr. Global.<br>
<br>
#3. Population reduction - you can call it genocide.<br>
<br>
#4. The installation of a World Government under the UN which is now under the control of the WEF." See mark 36:13 to 36:56.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Corona-Investigative-Committee:5/Reiner-Fuellmich-Introduction-English_BestCut:e" class="postlink">https://odysee.com/@Corona-Investigativ ... _BestCut:e</a><br>
<br>
He reminds us that we are dealing with megalomaniacs and sociopaths, those who lack a conscience. Fuellmich reminds us that while the mainstream media may censor, hundreds of thousands of people hear the message anyway; they are taking to the streets in protest in England, Germany, Australia, Brazil, etc. Civil servants, medical doctors, lawyers, politicians, nurses, and police officers are refusing the jab. <br>
<br>
Key elements include those of compassion and spirituality, as this has indeed become an epic struggle between right versus wrong. Reiner tells the story of a doctor who walked into a bank and was accosted by a person afraid because he was not wearing a mask. He hugged the individual who began to weep because they had not been held in more than a year. Fuellmich reminds us that we can all laugh, cry, and feel while they (the sociopaths) cannot.<br>
<br>
Attorney Rose, now a heroic icon, asked the ICC to take immediate action by way of legal injunction in Points 128 and 153: <br>
<br>
It is of the utmost urgency, that ICC take immediate action, taking all of this into account, to stop the rollout of covid vaccinations, introduction of unlawful vaccination passports and all other types of illegal warfare mentioned herein currently being waged against the people of the United Kingdom by way of a court injunction.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw" class="postlink">https://docdro.id/WUjv6iw</a><br>
<br>
In closing, Reiner Fuellmich asked us to remember spirituality. We must celebrate our humanity. Like those in the Nazi concentration camps, who remembered to sing and praise God in the face of the most extreme adversity, we too must cling to our roots in religion and love for one another. <br>
<br>
Fuellmich is confident that we will prevail. See mark 38:40.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Corona-Investigative-Committee:5/Reiner-Fuellmich-Introduction-English_BestCut:e" class="postlink">https://odysee.com/@Corona-Investigativ ... _BestCut:e</a><br>
<br>
That’s what this is all about, humanity versus inhumanity. We are human. We can laugh, cry, sing, dance and hug. The other side, Mr. Global and his puppets can’t do that. They can only fake feelings and have no empathy at all. This is because the other side has no access to the spiritual side. The US Constitution starts with the words, ‘We the People.’ And when the wall came down between East and West Berlin, 33 years ago, it was the East German people chanting – We the people – that brought it down. Mr. Global’s house of cards will come crashing down the very same way. Without a doubt in my mind, Mr. Global and his puppets will lose this war of good against evil – they will lose their insane war against life and creation itself. There is no other way.<br>
<br>
After hearing him speak, I am confident as well. Dr. Pierre Kory once told me, "This situation seems backward. The doctors were the corrupt people who caused this mess, but the lawyers are those with ethics who will save us."<br>
<br>
Pierre Kory, as usual, is correct. Someday, today's youth will become senior citizens. They will remind their society of today’s Nuremberg II trials, and how they helped stop the largest con job ever perpetrated on the world. It is time to end the lockdowns, the vaccination mandates, the censorship, and the propaganda.<br>
<br>
The media will resume reporting real news and cease fear-mongering. Then, journalists will return to what they do best – proper investigative reporting. And the International Criminal Court will most assuredly continue what it does best – bringing cold-blooded mass murderers to justice.<br>
