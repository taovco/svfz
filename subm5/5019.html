<br>
Sifting through over 30,000 grants in the company’s database, MintPress can reveal that the Gates Foundation has bankrolled hundreds of media outlets and ventures, to the tune of at least $319 million.<br>
<br>
SEATTLE — Up until his recent messy divorce, Bill Gates enjoyed something of a free pass in corporate media. Generally presented as a kindly nerd who wants to save the world, the Microsoft co-founder was even unironically christened “Saint Bill” by The Guardian.<br>
<br>
While other billionaires’ media empires are relatively well known, the extent to which Gates’s cash underwrites the modern media landscape is not. After sorting through over 30,000 individual grants, MintPress can reveal that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has made over $300 million worth of donations to fund media projects.<br>
<br>
Recipients of this cash include many of America’s most important news outlets, including CNN, NBC, NPR, PBS and The Atlantic. Gates also sponsors a myriad of influential foreign organizations, including the BBC, The Guardian, The Financial Times and The Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom; prominent European newspapers such as Le Monde (France), Der Spiegel (Germany) and El País (Spain); as well as big global broadcasters like Al-Jazeera.<br>
<br>
The Gates Foundation money going towards media programs has been split up into a number of sections, presented in descending numerical order, and includes a link to the relevant grant on the organization’s website.<br>

<br>
Together, these donations total $166,216,526. The money is generally directed towards issues close to the Gateses hearts. For example, the $3.6 million CNN grant went towards “report[ing] on gender equality with a particular focus on least developed countries, producing journalism on the everyday inequalities endured by women and girls across the world,” while the Texas Tribune received millions to “to increase public awareness and engagement of education reform issues in Texas.” Given that Bill is one of the charter schools’ most fervent supporters, a cynic might interpret this as planting pro-corporate charter school propaganda into the media, disguised as objective news reporting.<br>
<br>
The Gates Foundation has also given nearly $63 million to charities closely aligned with big media outlets, including nearly $53 million to BBC Media Action, over $9 million to MTV’s Staying Alive Foundation, and $1 million to The New York Times Neediest Causes Fund. While not specifically funding journalism, donations to the philanthropic arm of a media player should still be noted.<br>
<br>
Gates continues to underwrite a wide network of investigative journalism centers as well, totaling just over $38 million, more than half of which has gone to the D.C.-based International Center for Journalists to expand and develop African media.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">These centers include:</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
    International Center for Journalists- $20,436,938<br>
    Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (Nigeria) – $3,800,357<br>
    The Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting – $2,432,552<br>
    Fondation EurActiv Politech – $2,368,300<br>
    International Women’s Media Foundation – $1,500,000<br>
    Center for Investigative Reporting – $1,446,639<br>
    InterMedia Survey institute – $1,297,545<br>
    The Bureau of Investigative Journalism – $1,068,169<br>
    Internews Network – $985,126<br>
    Communications Consortium Media Center – $858,000<br>
    Institute for Nonprofit News – $650,021<br>
    The Poynter Institute for Media Studies- $382,997<br>
    Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (Nigeria)  – $360,211<br>
    Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies – $254,500<br>
    Global Forum for Media Development (Belgium) – $124,823<br>
    Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting – $100,000<br>
<br>
In addition to this, the Gates Foundation also plies press and journalism associations with cash, to the tune of at least $12 million. For example, the National Newspaper Publishers Association — a group representing more than 200 outlets — has received $3.2 million.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The list of these organizations includes:</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
    Education Writers Association – $5,938,475<br>
    National Newspaper Publishers Association – $3,249,176<br>
    National Press Foundation- $1,916,172<br>
    Washington News Council- $698,200<br>
    American Society of News Editors Foundation – $250,000<br>
    Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press- $25,000<br>
<br>
This brings our running total up to $216.4 million.<br>
<br>
The foundation also puts up the money to directly train journalists all over the world, in the form of scholarships, courses and workshops. Today, it is possible for an individual to train as a reporter thanks to a Gates Foundation grant, find work at a Gates-funded outlet, and to belong to a press association funded by Gates. This is especially true of journalists working in the fields of health, education and global development, the ones Gates himself is most active in and where scrutiny of the billionaire’s actions and motives are most necessary.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Gates Foundation grants pertaining to the instruction of journalists include:</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
    Johns Hopkins University – $1,866,408<br>
    Teachers College, Columbia University- $1,462,500<br>
    University of California Berkeley- $767,800       <br>
    Tsinghua University (China) – $450,000<br>
    Seattle University – $414,524<br>
    Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies – $254,500   <br>
    Rhodes University (South Africa) – $189,000<br>
    Montclair State University- $160,538<br>
    Pan-Atlantic University Foundation – $130,718<br>
    World Health Organization – $38,403<br>
    The Aftermath Project- $15,435<br>
<br>
The BMGF also pays for a wide range of specific media campaigns around the world. For example, since 2014 it has donated $5.7 million to the Population Foundation of India in order to create dramas that promote sexual and reproductive health, with the intent to increase family planning methods in South Asia. Meanwhile, it alloted over $3.5 million to a Senegalese organization to develop radio shows and online content that would feature health information. Supporters consider this to be helping critically underfunded media, while opponents might consider it a case of a billionaire using his money to plant his ideas and opinions into the press.<br>

Sifting through over 30,000 grants in the company’s database, MintPress can reveal that the Gates Foundation has bankrolled hundreds of media outlets and ventures, to the tune of at least $319 million.<br>
<br>
SEATTLE — Up until his recent messy divorce, Bill Gates enjoyed something of a free pass in corporate media. Generally presented as a kindly nerd who wants to save the world, the Microsoft co-founder was even unironically christened “Saint Bill” by The Guardian.<br>
<br>
While other billionaires’ media empires are relatively well known, the extent to which Gates’s cash underwrites the modern media landscape is not. After sorting through over 30,000 individual grants, MintPress can reveal that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has made over $300 million worth of donations to fund media projects.<br>
<br>
Recipients of this cash include many of America’s most important news outlets, including CNN, NBC, NPR, PBS and The Atlantic. Gates also sponsors a myriad of influential foreign organizations, including the BBC, The Guardian, The Financial Times and The Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom; prominent European newspapers such as Le Monde (France), Der Spiegel (Germany) and El País (Spain); as well as big global broadcasters like Al-Jazeera.<br>
<br>
The Gates Foundation money going towards media programs has been split up into a number of sections, presented in descending numerical order, and includes a link to the relevant grant on the organization’s website.<br>

<br>
Together, these donations total $166,216,526. The money is generally directed towards issues close to the Gateses hearts. For example, the $3.6 million CNN grant went towards “report[ing] on gender equality with a particular focus on least developed countries, producing journalism on the everyday inequalities endured by women and girls across the world,” while the Texas Tribune received millions to “to increase public awareness and engagement of education reform issues in Texas.” Given that Bill is one of the charter schools’ most fervent supporters, a cynic might interpret this as planting pro-corporate charter school propaganda into the media, disguised as objective news reporting.<br>
<br>
The Gates Foundation has also given nearly $63 million to charities closely aligned with big media outlets, including nearly $53 million to BBC Media Action, over $9 million to MTV’s Staying Alive Foundation, and $1 million to The New York Times Neediest Causes Fund. While not specifically funding journalism, donations to the philanthropic arm of a media player should still be noted.<br>
<br>
Gates continues to underwrite a wide network of investigative journalism centers as well, totaling just over $38 million, more than half of which has gone to the D.C.-based International Center for Journalists to expand and develop African media.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">These centers include:</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
    International Center for Journalists- $20,436,938<br>
    Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (Nigeria) – $3,800,357<br>
    The Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting – $2,432,552<br>
    Fondation EurActiv Politech – $2,368,300<br>
    International Women’s Media Foundation – $1,500,000<br>
    Center for Investigative Reporting – $1,446,639<br>
    InterMedia Survey institute – $1,297,545<br>
    The Bureau of Investigative Journalism – $1,068,169<br>
    Internews Network – $985,126<br>
    Communications Consortium Media Center – $858,000<br>
    Institute for Nonprofit News – $650,021<br>
    The Poynter Institute for Media Studies- $382,997<br>
    Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (Nigeria)  – $360,211<br>
    Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies – $254,500<br>
    Global Forum for Media Development (Belgium) – $124,823<br>
    Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting – $100,000<br>
<br>
In addition to this, the Gates Foundation also plies press and journalism associations with cash, to the tune of at least $12 million. For example, the National Newspaper Publishers Association — a group representing more than 200 outlets — has received $3.2 million.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The list of these organizations includes:</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
    Education Writers Association – $5,938,475<br>
    National Newspaper Publishers Association – $3,249,176<br>
    National Press Foundation- $1,916,172<br>
    Washington News Council- $698,200<br>
    American Society of News Editors Foundation – $250,000<br>
    Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press- $25,000<br>
<br>
This brings our running total up to $216.4 million.<br>
<br>
The foundation also puts up the money to directly train journalists all over the world, in the form of scholarships, courses and workshops. Today, it is possible for an individual to train as a reporter thanks to a Gates Foundation grant, find work at a Gates-funded outlet, and to belong to a press association funded by Gates. This is especially true of journalists working in the fields of health, education and global development, the ones Gates himself is most active in and where scrutiny of the billionaire’s actions and motives are most necessary.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Gates Foundation grants pertaining to the instruction of journalists include:</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
    Johns Hopkins University – $1,866,408<br>
    Teachers College, Columbia University- $1,462,500<br>
    University of California Berkeley- $767,800       <br>
    Tsinghua University (China) – $450,000<br>
    Seattle University – $414,524<br>
    Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies – $254,500   <br>
    Rhodes University (South Africa) – $189,000<br>
    Montclair State University- $160,538<br>
    Pan-Atlantic University Foundation – $130,718<br>
    World Health Organization – $38,403<br>
    The Aftermath Project- $15,435<br>
<br>
The BMGF also pays for a wide range of specific media campaigns around the world. For example, since 2014 it has donated $5.7 million to the Population Foundation of India in order to create dramas that promote sexual and reproductive health, with the intent to increase family planning methods in South Asia. Meanwhile, it alloted over $3.5 million to a Senegalese organization to develop radio shows and online content that would feature health information. Supporters consider this to be helping critically underfunded media, while opponents might consider it a case of a billionaire using his money to plant his ideas and opinions into the press.<br>
