<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A Roman Diplomatic Mission that journeyed to that country some thirty five years on located a single survivor, who recounted the Syrian towns and villages on the invasion route were filled with all manner of statuary which the Romans looted. The extra weight slowed their column which became strung out while those at the rear parties were under constant harassment by the Syrian cavalry .. experienced Roman Officers on Crassus' staff advised him to halt the column at a certain river, build a repository for the loot and allow the stragglers to catch up.<br>
<br>
Crassus spurned their advice and insisted the column should march on which it did to extinction .. the survivor was from an engineering detachment whose leaders realized what was taking place and knew the danger they were in, he said they built a stockade from where they defended themselves. Which is how they escaped the fate the rest of the army suffered .. he knew of only seven other living survivors who were in outlying parts of the country, he had taken up with a Syrian woman and with his engineering skills he became one of the leading citizens and builders in that country.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/unexplained-phenomena/lost-legion-carrhae-0011019" class="postlink"><strong class="text-strong">The Legend of the Lost Legion of Carrhae</strong></a> begins in 53 BC with <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/battle-carrhae-crushing-defeat-unstoppable-roman-juggernaut-parthian-empire-006055" class="postlink">the Battle of Carrhae </a> between the Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus and the Parthian general Surena. Carrhae is a location near the modern-day Syrian-Turkish border. In antiquity, it was near the fringes of the Roman Empire in the west and the Parthian Empire in the east. Crassus was already one of the wealthiest men in the Roman republic, but he had a desire to access the wealth of Parthia.<br>
<br>
He convinced the Senate to let him lead 42,000 Roman soldiers into the battlefield against the Parthians. .. in the battle, Crassus and his army suffered <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/cataphracts-armored-warriors-and-their-horses-war-003361" class="postlink">a humiliating defeat </a> at the hands of Surena and his 10,000 archers. Crassus attempted to negotiate a truce but was killed in the process. According to legend, liquid gold was poured down his throat as a punishment for his greed. He was also allegedly beheaded, and his body was desecrated.<br>
<br>
Of the surviving <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/roman-legions-0014214" class="postlink">Roman soldiers, </a> 10,000 of them were captured alive by the Parthians. According to some accounts, they were relocated to the eastern border of the Parthian Empire. It is believed that they were most likely sent to what is now Turkmenistan. It was a Parthian custom to send prisoners of war captured in the west to the far east to secure their loyalty against their eastern rivals, the Huns.<br>
<br>
17 years later, in 36 BC, on the western border of the Han Chinese Empire, the battle of Zhizhi was fought between the Chinese and <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/merciless-marauders-or-fearsome-fighters-terror-tactics-huns-007719" class="postlink">the Huns </a>, a classical enemy of China. The Chinese annals record mercenaries fighting on the side of the Huns who used a “fish scale” formation. The fish scale formation impressed the Chinese and they invited the soldiers to come back to China and become part of the border guard in the modern Gansu province. A city and county were also made for them which were named Li-Jien or Liqian. <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/unexplained-phenomena/lost-legion-carrhae-0011019" class="postlink">AncientOrigins</a>.</div></blockquote>

“There is a myth that some of the modern-day residents of Zhelaizhai (now Liqian village,[3] in Jiaojiazhuang township)[4] are descendants of a group of Roman soldiers that were never accounted for after being captured in the Battle of Carrhae. However, eminent Chinese authorities, a 2007 genetic study, and archaeologists have debunked this theory.“  <br>
