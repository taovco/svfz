<br>
"Guilt must be proven" that applies to everyone, ppl can't just turn up in a courtroom and declare themselves guilty they have to prove they committed the offence, Ridgway has since pleaded guilty to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORa9gAddOEg" class="postlink">forty ninth murder</a> and says he committed seventy one killings in all, while some say there were as many as <a href="https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/serial-killers/gary-ridgway/" class="postlink">ninety</a> victims. It seems he will nod his head to anything and is taking the blame for kills "cleared" with the FBI and regional law enforcement, who in turn receive accolades for solving the crimes .. at no time does it look like he slaughtered forty nine women.<br>
<br>
Research proves a person fights like a demon when he or she is being murdered, rake marks on the perpetrator's face and body and skin recovered from under the deceased's fingernails have secured convictions, Ridgeway's face is unmarked. His claim that while driving in company with his son he picked up a prostitute then took her into some brush and murdered her while his offspring waited in the car, does not ring true.<br>
<br>
He told investigators he would take them to locations he had concealed bodies, he had a day out of prison but no bodies were found, he said he strangled the first victim the police say she was shot. It is not uncommon for innocent ppl to confess to crimes .. there is no evidence Ridgeway murdered a single victim while he is known to have been at his place of employment when many of the killings took place - So if Ridgeway never killed them it means someone else did, the prosecutors and judges have taken the easy way out by accepting his guilty plea.<br>

He also can't "remember" where the majority of his victims were buried, yet claims to have returned again and again to have sex with them. In most cases serial killers may not remember names or faces, but they keep great tabs on the their dump sites. This in and of itself is enough to make me question his conviction of all the murders.

He said he had no recollection of any murders .. ok the logistics of "systemically" murdering eight nurses are difficult to comprehend.<br>
<br>
Surely as soon as the nine girls realized there was an interloper among them they would have screamed the house down, and what did they do while the beatings and rape were taking place, the nine of them should have been able to gain the upper hand or at least raise the alarm. I do not like the sound of any of it and considering the Ricard Speck case, the Gary Ridgway affair and the Albert Desalvo stuff, it is clear there are major problems in law enforcement.</div></blockquote></div>
