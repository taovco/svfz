<strong class="text-strong">The US 7th Cavalry's Lt Colonel Nee General George Armstrong Custer who lost his entire command of 270 men, was accused of having in company with a Crow Indian Scout raped a Sioux woman a short time before the battle began!</strong><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">On June 25, 1876, LTC George Armstrong Custer led the U.S. 7th Cavalry into an action against a vastly superior force of Native American tribes consisting of combined forces of the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes at the Little Big Horn in the Montana Territory. Custer’s Cavalry consisted of 12 companies with 45 officers and 718 enlisted men.</em><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Custer vastly underestimated the strength of the Native American tribes and his immediate thoughts were on how to stop them from fleeing. He split his command into three columns and he took five companies to attack the Indian village, completely unaware that his 212 men were facing thousands of battle-hardened Native American warriors.</em><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">The Native Americans were given the land as a reservation after signing a treaty with the United States. But gold was found in the Black Hills and the government, with no true legal standing was going to take it by force. The Indian tribes weren’t going to go quietly.<br>
<br>
It was a slaughter. In less than 30 minutes, his entire command of the five companies was wiped out. Among the dead were his two brothers, a nephew and dozens of horses. After Custer and his men were killed the Indian warriors attacked the other two split units where hard fighting between the two sides raged until the Cavalrymen got reinforcements and the Indians withdrew. <a href="https://www.voat.xyz/On%20This%20Day%20in%201891,%20the%20Only%20Survivor%20of%20Custer%E2%80%99s%20Last%20Stand%20Died" class="postlink">Link</a>.</em></div></blockquote>

Government policy kept the Indians hungry and better armed than the troopers sent to keep an eye on them, whose rifles were single-shot Springfields" - <em class="text-italics">Makes me suspicious, we know the you-know-whos are gun dealers sounds like the Cavalry were "set up!"

When US Cavalry reinforcements arrived on the battlefield several hours after the Indian attack had wiped out Custer’s troops, they found the 14 year old horse Comanche that had belonged to Capt. Myles Keough who perished in the battle, badly wounded but still living and standing over the Captain's body. <a href="https://www.sdpb.org/blogs/images-of-the-past/the-sole-survivor-on-the-army-side-of-custers-last-stand/" class="postlink">Link</a>.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Wonder if Frank Finkel who claimed Prussian heritage who says he escaped the massacre when his horse bolted thru the Indian lines might be the villain of the piece, could be that his Prussian Officer mannerisms and as a Jew his influence over Custer was considerable, suppose he had connections to the ones [Jews] who sold the Henry rifles to the tribesmen, and that he persuaded Custer to split his forces and to enter their trap .. that the Injuns knew him and allowed him thru!</strong><br>

<strong class="text-strong">Update:</strong> We should open our minds to the contention that Finkel who could have been an auxiliary in the first place since his name does not appear in official US Army records, had deserted Custer's command and "gone over" to the Indians.<br>
<br>

 <br>
Following on from that can we not conjecture Finkel could indeed have been a journalist since it is known there were journalists in the column, which is another Zionist trick in that Sandhurst graduate Winston Churchill had accompanied Kitchener's 1898 genocidal assault on <a href="https://mg.co.za/article/1998-09-11-britain-will-not-say-sorry-for" class="postlink">Khartoum</a> not as a military officer but as a journalist.<br>
<br>
That Finkel had been recommended to Custer by the Jews who then as now had the entire US military and political establishments in their thrall, who were responsible for his meteoric rise thru the ranks to become a two star general in the Civil War in the first place, as an expert in Prussian methods of war. In which capacity he was accepted into Custer's inner circle, from which position he gave advice that led to the defeat .. then as the Indians closed in he joined them.</div>
