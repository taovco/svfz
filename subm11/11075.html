Eli Cara 50 at the front, and Uriel Zoshe Kelman 30, who held his hand over his face the whole time, agents of the Israeli secret service Mossad, have each been sentenced in the Auckland High Court to six months prison on passport fraud charges.</div></blockquote>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8zZ4Xf8J/SPBA-1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Cara was the man in the movie made on the grounds of Queensland University at St Lucia in the story below when a young person is alleged to have been slain, a statue of a Baltic Archbishop has been erected at the spot .. Queensland Premier Anna Bligh says this is "ancient history," as well as being corrupt in relation to this matter she is the great champion of abortion genocide.<br><br>
August 18, 1997, ABC newsreader Rod Young tells viewers snuff films have allegedly been produced in Brisbane, citing alleged existence of video tape shot on the bank of the Brisbane river in which a young male person is murdered .. Young claims someone alleges police are aware of the existence of this tape and alleges high level police and government corruption.<br><br>
August 19, Young reiterates the allegation of the existence of the taped killing and of cover up Channel 10 News has picked up the story, Premier of the day Peter Beattie says on television there should be a Royal Commission.<br><br>
August 25, Young introduces the story again, the station shows corrupt black and white footage clearly shot with a hand held black and white camera, of a heavyset dark haired man sitting on a ratty couch in a tatty room watching television.<br><br>
Showing on the television is footage of a male person approximately twelve years old, accompanied by a heavyset man with dark closely cropped hair aged about mid to late twenties, who resembles the man watching the television set, a copper or a security man maybe.<br><br>
Young says then a hand clutching a knife emerges from off camera and the young person is slain, In the background one can see the mangrove banks adjacent to Queensland University at St. Lucia, and across the river the high ground near the ferry terminal adjacent to Dutton Park cemetery.</div></blockquote>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kGrNkxXs/SPBA-2.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><a href="https://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/sites/default/files/Docs/Public-Hearings/Inquiry-into-allegations-of-misconduct-paedophilia-Kimmins/Inquiry-into-allegations-of-misconduct-in-the-investigation-of-paedophilia-in-qld-Report-1998.pdf" class="postlink">Kimmins Report</a>.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Jim Slade told the special CJC Inquiry chaired by Judge Kimmins convened in response to the taped killing allegations, that while he was a policeman in 1985 he witnessed murder as described when he attended a viewing of the tape in company with other police, the official police response is Slade is lying.<br><br>
In July 1998 we contacted the Kimmins Inquiry Counsel disclaimed knowledge of the tape the ABC aired August 25, 1997, and says one should depose in writing the claim one had seen the TV news reports as described, submit it to the Kimmins inquiry c/o The CJC, and they would "have a look at it."<br><br>
Nothing was ever done, the Judge engaged in semantic discourse over the "Terms of Reference," the media swallowed it and the political and media hierarchy turned away.<br><br>
The Sturgess Inquiry under Police Minister Neville Harper in 1984, first raised the snuff issue, Harper went on TV and told the world that the reports were "harrowing," and reported that the movie was reproduced by simply filming the television set showing the original film!</div></blockquote>

To aid the illusion that America was fighting a legitimate war in Iraq, they had been torturers at Abu Ghraib prison .. while British SAS soldiers were caught with a carload of IEDs and detonation devices in the Basra area .. both sets of events were hushed up in the news. Jerry Mazza is a freelance writer living in New York City.</div></blockquote>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9QqXJSNv/Crest-Hotel.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><a href="http://travelsplace.com/australasia/australia/carltoncrestbrisbane/index.html" class="postlink">The Crest Hotel in Brisbane</a>.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">Personal note..</strong> 1972 a friend of mine met a Jewish chick at a party, Saturday afternoon days later at the underground public bar of the Crest Hotel in Brisbane some of her friends came in.. my mate told me that one of them makes blue movies and had inquired as to whether he wished to appear in one.<br><br>
He was solidly built, stretchin' to make middle height, somewhat florid urbanely disposed individual, who was on his way to the Gold Coast 100 k south of Brisbane to make movies.. must have been Barkan, there was a blowy lookin' chick with them. They were accompanied by a man that I recognized as an ambulance man I now know to be Eli Cara aka Anthony David Resnick.<br><br>
And know that he is in the movie snippert Young hosted on the ABC News in 1997 in company with the young person he said was slain. They never stayed long, Cara appeared to be on a steroids program at the time, the prior acquaintanceship with him was a couple of chance meetings in the workplace.<br><br>
Friend's girlfriend indicated that they were on their way to shoot footage even as they departed, her demeanor suggested dark deeds were afoot.. it is not uncommon for professional photographers to use similar riverside locations, so maybe that was the day they made the movie on the river bank at St Lucia.<br><br>
His name is --, she was -- now -, since it seems unlikely that she would set her intended spouse up for a snuff killing, I can only assume that I was the intended target, they had the young person with them, when he went to go into the pub with them Barkan told him to go back to the car!</div></blockquote>
