<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The legislation would aid victims of directed energy attacks as they seek medical care for symptoms that can include brain damage.<br>
<br>
The House on Tuesday unanimously passed a bill to aid Americans believed to be suffering from “Havana Syndrome,” as the Biden administration struggles to understand how and why U.S. spies and diplomats are developing mysterious, debilitating brain injuries.<br>
<br>
The illness, believed to be the result of an invisible directed-energy attack, has long stumped U.S. intelligence officials, and reports of what the government officially calls “anomalous health incidents” have skyrocketed in recent months. At the same time, the victims — which total around 200, officials say — have faced bureaucratic hurdles as they seek medical care for symptoms that can range from severe headaches to brain damage.<br>
<br>
After POLITICO first reported earlier this year the alarming increase in suspected incidents both on U.S. soil and abroad, Republican and Democratic lawmakers who serve on the House and Senate intelligence committees drew up legislation to boost medical resources for these individuals.<br>
<br>
The bill, dubbed the HAVANA Act, authorizes new funding for treatment and gives the CIA director and the secretary of state increased flexibility on how the money is spent. It also requires both to report regularly to Congress on the funding initiatives. Behind closed doors, lawmakers have expressed frustration with the intelligence community for what they perceive to be a failure to sufficiently address the matter in recent years.<br>
<br>
“There’s no higher priority than ensuring the safety of our people, and the individuals who’ve served our country now suffering from these troubling health incidents deserve answers and our support,” said House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who led the effort in the lower chamber.<br>
<br>
The Senate unanimously passed the bill in June; it now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.<br>
<br>
“President Biden supports the HAVANA Act and congressional efforts to provide additional support to individuals who have experienced anomalous health incidents,” a senior administration official said. “It is a top priority to ensure they receive the medical care they need, and we are working with Congress to expand benefits to affected individuals across the U.S. government.”<br>
<br>
Biden himself has committed to getting to the bottom of the mysterious illness.<br>
<br>
“My administration is coordinating a government-wide effort to respond to these incidents, because this challenge demands… that departments and agencies, including the entire intelligence community, work together with urgency,” Biden said during a recent visit with intelligence officials.<br>
<br>
Victims of the suspected attacks have reported symptoms including intense ringing and pressure in the ears, loss of cognitive abilities, and even permanent brain damage. The illness dates back to 2016, when U.S. diplomats posted in Havana began reporting symptoms.<br>
<br>
The threat has since grown significantly; this year alone, several U.S. personnel posted in Vienna — a hotspot for international spies — have developed related symptoms, according to two officials familiar with the investigation. Two National Security Council officials are also believed to have been hit with directed-energy attacks on U.S. soil — one in Arlington, Va., and another on the south lawn of the White House. Europe is quickly becoming a hotspot for the incidents, officials say. Others were detected in south Florida.<br>
<br>
The New Yorker first reported the spike in Vienna-based cases.<br>
<br>
U.S. officials believe that Russia’s military-intelligence unit, the GRU, is responsible for the suspected attacks, POLITICO first reported. While there has been no formal attribution, the GRU is believed to be technologically capable of pulling off such attacks, and it has known footprints in all of the countries and cities where the incidents have been reported. A working theory is that the Russian covert operatives used microwave radiation to collect data from their targets’ devices.<br>
<br>
<br>
Still, the U.S. has struggled, through various investigations, to learn more about the technology behind the suspected attacks. It raises the possibility that a foreign adversary has developed technology that the U.S. does not fully understand — a major national security vulnerability.<br>
<br>
The Biden administration has intensified efforts to get to the bottom of it; the investigation has expanded to include the entire intelligence community in addition to the National Institutes of Health, which is assisting in analyzing victims’ symptoms.<br>
<br>
Already, CIA Director William Burns has devoted significant resources to the issue, receiving near-daily updates and appointing a senior officer responsible for running point on the investigation. That individual, whose identity is classified, previously oversaw the successful manhunt for Osama bin Laden, the terrorist mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks.<br>
<br>
In a recent NPR interview, Burns said he has met with several victims of the suspected directed-energy attacks.<br>
<br>
“I am absolutely determined — and I’ve spent a great deal of time and energy on this in the four months I've been CIA director — to get to the bottom of the question of what and who caused this,” Burns said, describing the threat as “real” and “serious.”<br>
<br>
“It's a profound obligation, I think, of any leader to take care of your people, and that’s what I’m determined to do,” he added.<br>
<br>
Burns’ team has been directly impacted by the matter, too. According to CNN, a member of Burns’ staff came down with symptoms of a directed-energy attack during the director’s recent trip to India.<br>

			<div class="content">Vienna Is the New Havana Syndrome Hot Spot - By Adam Entous <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/vienna-is-the-new-havana-syndrome-hotspot" class="postlink">https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-des ... me-hotspot</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>July 16, 2021 [7/7]<br>
<br>
Roughly two dozen possible new cases have been reported by U.S. spies and diplomats in the Austrian capital, more than in any other city except Havana itself.<br>
<br>
Since Joe Biden took office, about two dozen U.S. intelligence officers, diplomats, and other government officials in Vienna have reported experiencing mysterious afflictions similar to the Havana Syndrome. U.S. officials say the number of possible new cases in the Austrian capital—long a nexus of U.S. and Russian espionage—is now greater than the number reported by officials in any city except for Havana itself, where the first cases were reported.<br>
<br>
The exact cause of the ailments in Vienna, which U.S. government agencies formally refer to as “anomalous health incidents” or “unexplained health incidents,” remains unknown, but in response to the surge the C.I.A., the State Department, and other agencies are redoubling their efforts to determine the cause, and to identify the culprit or culprits. A C.I.A. spokesperson said that the agency’s director, William Burns, was “personally engaged with personnel affected by anomalous health incidents and is highly committed to their care and to determining the cause of these incidents.” Privately, Burns has called the maladies “attacks” rather than incidents. A State Department spokesman said, “In coordination with our partners across the U.S. government, we are vigorously investigating reports of possible unexplained health incidents among the U.S. Embassy Vienna community.”..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Diane sat down with Thomas Hübl to discuss his new book, Healing Collective Trauma, and his perspective on healing collective trauma. Thomas joined us from Israel and shared his insightful and heartfelt experiences with treating collective trauma, particularly in Germany and Israel, but also worldwide. He shared his observations when healing in a group where the transmission of healing impacts every  citizen of the healing process. Using the group nervous system to process trauma, you can feel the collective resonance rising and hold the collective healing field...<br>

<br>
Virtual Reality is an important element in the matrix, because it allows for the benefits of face-to-face communication and physical interaction, to be combined with the benefits of not having to share the same physical space. In virtual reality we can collaborate across borders without traveling, and work together across disciplines, to unlock the latent potential of our collective creativity and imagination.<br>
<br>
Our strategy is to establish a Global Community Center online – connected to a network of real life City hubs.  The first City hub has already been established in Copenhagen in collaboration with Copenhagen City’s Department for Sustainable Development.<br>

PEACE DAY 2021 - INTERGENERATIONAL ASSEMBLY <a href="https://www.citytransformers.org/2021-2/" class="postlink">https://www.citytransformers.org/2021-2/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Each year the <span style="color:#FF0040">International Day of Peace</span> is observed around the world on 21 September. The UN General Assembly has declared this as a day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peaceful collaboration, both within and among all nations and peoples.<br>
<br>
On Peace Day 2020 young changemakers from almost 100 cities worldwide came together in a Global Youth Assembly to discuss imminent and impending global issues.<br>
They voiced their concerns, their hopes for the future, and their desire and commitment to work with global leaders to create a world that works for all within the limits of the planet.<br>
<br>
The epi­cen­ter of the event was YOUTH IS­LAND – a former sea fort­ress loc­ated a short sail­ing trip from the UN-City in Copen­ha­gen. After har­vest­ing the views and con­clu­sions that emerged dur­ing dis­cus­sions that took place on six dif­fer­ent con­tin­ents, The as­sembly iden­ti­fied a num­ber of im­min­ent and ur­gent is­sues that must be ad­dressed by the World Lead­ers.<br>
<br>
On Peace day, Septem­ber 21, a del­eg­a­tion of youth rep­res­ent­at­ives sailed from Youth Is­land to the UN City in Copen­ha­gen on a Vik­ing Ship, to hand over the con­clu­sions to UNDP Dir­ector Ca­m­illa Brück­ner, who prom­ised to for­ward the con­clu­sions to the Gen­eral As­sembly.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Haggis hurling has gained massive popularity over the past few decades. It began in 1977 when Irishman <span style="color:#FF0040">Robin Dunseath</span> placed an advert in a national newspaper inviting entrants to The World Haggis Hurling Competition.</div></blockquote>

The Ancient Sport of Haggis Hurling <a href="http://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/haggis_hurling" class="postlink">http://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/haggis_hurling</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>But on January 25, 2004, haggis hurlers throughout the world were stunned to learn that their sport wasn't ancient at all. It was just a modern invention. A hoax.<br>
<br>
The news was broken by Scotland's Sunday Herald which reported that the sport had been invented in 1977 by, of all things, <span style="color:#FF0040">an Irishman, Robin Dunseath, in order to "gauge the gullibility of the Scots."</span><br>
<br>
Dunseath had served for 20 years as President of the World Haggis Hurling Association, but he told the paper that he had finally decided to come clean and reveal the sport's faux origins because he was worried that the sport was becoming too commercial and ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Dunseath, who had been working as a publicist for <span style="color:#FF0040">Scottish entrepreneur Tom Farmer</span> back in 1977, offered this explanation of how the sport actually originated:<br>
<br>
"It was all just a joke. Myself and a few friends got together because we were annoyed at people exploiting Scotland for their personal advantage, selling all of this rubbish - tartan knickers and tartan pencils - to tourists.<br>
<br>
"I took out an advert in a national paper advertising the world haggis hurling championships at the Gathering of the Clans and we were amazed by the response. Hundreds of people turned up and they took the sport back to the United States, Canada and Australia and started hurling haggis under the impression they were reviving an ancient Scots sport."

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He returned to Edinburgh to found the Kwik Fit chain of garages in 1971. The firm grew quickly, mainly through acquisition, including opening in the Netherlands in 1975. Farmer was named Scottish Businessman of the Year in 1989..<br>
<br>
In 2006, he donated £100,000 to the Scottish National Party to help fund their campaign for the 2007 Scottish Parliament general election. Farmer commented at the time that it was not an indication of his political allegiance but that he wanted the SNP to be able to compete financially with their better-funded political opponents.[15] Farmer repeated his endorsement for the SNP in the 2011 election..<br>

Farmer lives in Edinburgh, with his wife Anne. They have one daughter, one son and four grandchildren. Farmer also owns the island of <span style="color:#FF0040">Inchkeith</span> in the Firth of Forth..<br>
<br>
Farmer was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 2009 New Year Honours for his work as chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.[18] Farmer was made a Knight Commander with Star of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, and he was also knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1997.</div></blockquote>

Inchkeith as quarantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchkeith#Inchkeith_as_quarantine" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchkeith ... quarantine</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 1497, the island was (along with Inchgarvie, a few miles away) used as an isolated refuge for victims of 'grandgore' (also spelled 'glandgore'), an old Scots name for 'syphilis', in Edinburgh.[16] The 'grandgor' was recognised in the 1497 Minutes of the Town Council of Edinborough (Phil. Trans. XLII. 421) "This contagious sickness callit the Grandgor.". The Grandgore Act was passed in September 1497, causing Inchkeith, as well as other islands in the Firth, such as Inchgarvie, to be made a place of "Compulsory Retirement" for people suffering from this disease.[17] They were told to board a ship at Leith and once there, "to remain till God provide for their health". It is probable that they all died.<br>
<br>
In 1589, history repeated itself and the island was used to quarantine the passengers of a plague-ridden ship. More plague sufferers came here from the mainland in 1609. In 1799, Russian sailors who died of an infectious disease were buried here..<br>
<br>
James IV's linguistic experiment<br>
During the reign of James IV of Scotland, Inchkeith was allegedly the site of a language deprivation experiment. Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie wrote in a chronicle that in 1493, James IV directed that a mute woman and two infants be transported to the island, in order to ascertain which language the infants would grow up to speak isolated from the rest of the world. This speech, in contemporary theory, would be the "original" language, or the "language of God". </div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Queen's Chapel of St John the Baptist in the Precinct of the Savoy, also known as the Queen's Chapel of the Savoy, is a church in the City of Westminster, London. Facing it are 111 Strand, the Savoy Hotel, the Institution of Engineering and Technology and – across the green to its side – the east side of Savoy Street. It is designated as a Grade II* listed building..<br>
<br>
The chapel sits on the site of the Savoy Palace, once owned by John of Gaunt, that was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Gaunt's Duchy of Lancaster, the owner of the site of the palace, eventually came into the hands of the monarch. ..<br>
<br>
The chapel is owned by the Duchy of Lancaster and as such is a Royal Peculiar – outside the jurisdiction of a diocese, but under that of the reigning monarch. The church is the chapel of the Royal Victorian Order, whose full gathering takes place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, to accommodate those numbers.</div></blockquote>

The present buildings date from 1875 and are notable for the painted stone statues by Thomas Eustace of a boy and girl, dating from about 1715,[8] now on the north face of the school; its playgrounds intersperse with the churchyard, and the school maintains close links with the Church of England.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>September 24, 2021<br>
<br>
The CIA has removed its Vienna station chief following criticism of his management, including what some considered an inadequate response to reports of "Havana syndrome" incidents at the U.S. Embassy there, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.<br>
<br>
The Post, which cited unnamed current and former U.S. officials, reported the action would send a message that leaders must take seriously the Havana syndrome, a mysterious set of ailments that include migraines, nausea, memory lapses and dizziness.<br>
<br>
A CIA spokesperson said the agency does not comment on specific incidents or officers.<br>
<br>
The Washington Post said dozens of U.S. personnel in the Austrian capital, including diplomats and intelligence officials, as well as some of the children of U.S. employees, have reported symptoms of the syndrome.<br>
<br>
CIA Director William Burns said in July that about 100 CIA officers and family members were among some 200 U.S. officials and kin sickened by Havana syndrome.<br>
<br>
The ailments were first reported by officials based in the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2016.<br>
<br>
Last year, a U.S. National Academy of Sciences panel found that the most plausible theory is that "directed, pulsed radio frequency energy" causes the syndrome.<br>
<br>
Burns has said there is a "very strong possibility" the syndrome is intentionally caused and that Russia could be responsible. Moscow denies involvement.<br>

Russia again?  Hmmm.... <br>
<br>
What is really messed up is that I can't find any American media reports which actually name the ousted CIA Vienna bureau chief.</div>
