Excerpts:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Has the petrol crisis triggered you to consider an electric car now? Motor sale sites say searches rocketed 60% during fuel panic buying weekend<br>
<br>
    Auto Trader says used EV searches rose by 61% over the weekend - new by 28%<br>
    Carwow said fuel supply crisis could be the most influential switching event ever<br>
    Reports of surging EV interest comes as some filling stations have been forced to close due to reserves being bought up by selfish stockpiling motorists <br>
<br>
Online motor sales sites have tracked huge spikes in electric car interest in recent days, with panic buying of petrol potentially triggering the 'most influential switching event ever'.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of thousands of commuters unable to fill up on Monday were forced to work from home, while some taxi drivers were unable to hit the road as forecourts started to run out of petrol and diesel.<br>
<br>
Scenes of enormous tailbacks outside filling stations and motorists filling jerry cans have dominated the national media since Friday, when motorists began to rush to the pumps amidst concerns about the lack of HGV drivers to deliver supplies of fuel.<br>
<br>
For some, it could be the tipping point for their intentions to ditch their internal-combustion-engine cars and get behind the wheel of EVs.<br>
<br>
Has the last few days of petrol panic buying changed your mind about EVs? As an electric Tesla is photographed driving past a queue of cars waiting to fill up at a BP station in Peterborough, online retailers suggest the recent crisis could trigger many to switch to battery models now<br>
<br>
The bedlam witnessed in recent days has sparked a massive upsurge in demand for electric cars, with the UK's biggest automotive marketplace, Auto Trader, claiming that electric car advert views have skyrocketed as more Britons toy with the idea of making the switch well ahead of the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel models in 2030.<br>
<br>
'We are all familiar with the idea of range anxiety, but the events of the past few days mean we are entering the age of fuel anxiety,' said Ian Plummer, commercial director, Auto Trader. <br>
<br>
'We have seen a massive surge in consumer engagement for electric cars on our marketplace over the weekend.<br>
<br>
'Not only did the number of advert views for new and used electric models increase a record 28 per cent and 61 per cent respectively versus the previous weekend, but we also saw a huge uplift in the number of people sending enquiries to retailers, with one sent every two minutes. <br>
<br>
'This suggests that people aren't simply flirting with the idea of electric but have been encouraged to actively pursue a purchase.'<br>
<br>
Auto Trader said advert views for second-hand electric models rose 61% over the weekend as more drivers appear tempted by the prospect of charging at home and avoiding petrol stations<br>
<br>
Motor sales platform carwow also claims to have experienced an 'unprecedented boom' in people looking to switch to electric vehicles, with online searches increasing by 28 per cent on Friday - when panic buying began - to 43 per cent on Saturday and as high as 56 per cent by Sunday.<br>
<br>
Sepi Arani, carwow's director of trade, said: 'The fuel supply crisis and the scenes of panic at the pumps could prove to be the most influential switching event ever, with more people than ever considering switching to electric.<br>
<br>
'The levels of demand for EVs through carwow this weekend have been completely unprecedented and are genuine proof that ​more people want to make the switch,' he adds.<br>
<br>
'After a weekend of queuing, frustration and hysteria, having the option to charge your vehicle from the comfort of your own home, or from a public charging point, seems like bliss for more and more people.<br>
<br>
'What's more, with second-hand car prices rocketing, there's really never been a better time to sell your car and make the switch to electric – you'll get a great price for your current vehicle, you'll be more than ready for the NetZero changes that are inevitably coming, and you'll never have to worry about a fuel shortage again....<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">'Concern about petrol availability won't end when the pumps start up again, and so this increased interest represents a unique opportunity to inform, to excite and to incentivise car owners to make the switch. <br>
<br>
'If the Government is serious about reaching its 2030 targets, then it is one it can ill afford to miss.'</span></strong></div></blockquote><strong class="text-strong"><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">And there we have it folks...It was all about selling the concept of Agenda 2030 to the gullible plebs. From the manufactured 'petrol crisis' to the following predictable overreactions and panic. Then present them with a solution. Why do people fall for this shit over and over again?</strong></strong></div>
