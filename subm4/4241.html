<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Born as Sabine Kurjo in Silesia, I survived the bombing of Dresden as a 4-months-old baby thanks to my then 22-year-old mum. I grew up in the North of Germany (near Bremerhaven), finished school in the South (Munich), studied mathematics and computing in the middle (Darmstadt) and started work as a systems analyst at CERN the European Centre for Nuclear Research in Geneva, where the web was born.<br>
<br>
In 1973 I was sent to Lawrence Radiation Lab in Berkeley, but a physicist friend of mine fell asleep while driving and we fell for 25 feet. Even though the doctor of the insurance company said I will not suffer in later life, I have not been without pain ever since. But I am realigning my skeleton most successfully with Bikram Yoga.<br>
<br>
In 1981 I came to London with the vision of a ‘peace network’ of people and computers protecting our planet. I created <span style="color:#FF0040">“Turning Points @ St. James’s”</span> and ran it until 1988. It still continues today as Alternatives.<br>
<br>
I organised many other events, conferences and seminars and co-founded ‘NetReach’ – Networking Computers and Reaching out to People by Computer. <br>
<br>
In 1988 I married Ian R McNeill who as a young man had been the Assistant Director of the Greater London Council. I learned from him how to write in English and together we wrote the book “Only Connect – The Art and Technology of Networking for Personal Change and Global Transformation”.<br>
<br>
Since 1996 I wrote and withdrew five patent applications, produced four pieces of prototype software and participated in many scientific seminars and conferences. I constantly need to compare why, although my thinking is ‘outside the box’, it makes sense: if and only if, it is expressed via software.<br>

Arnold Keyserling and the School of Wisdom <a href="https://schoolofwisdom.com/about/" class="postlink">https://schoolofwisdom.com/about/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The School of Wisdom was founded in 1920 in Darmstadt, Germany by Count Hermann Keyserling (1880–1946). The Count had just become one of the most popular authors of the day from is first book, Travel Diary of a Philosopher. At the same time as his best seller luck he had very bad luck at home. The Russian communists confiscated his family estate in Estonia and he had to flee for his life. His families position there went back centuries. One of his ancestors is the Count Keyserling who commissioned Bach to create the Brandenberg Concertos. Herman Keyserling fled Estonia in late 1918 and roamed for a short time as a homeless refugee. Still, he was a famous author from a titled family and was given shelter at the Bismarck family estate just outside of Berlin. A year later Keylserling married Otto Bismark’s granddaughter, Countess Maria Goedela Bismarck (1896–1981). <br>
<br>
Shortly after his honeymoon Hermann and Maria moved to Darmstadt, Germany, to start the School of Wisdom. Darmstadt was then attempting to become a small town haven for artists and intellectuals. Hermann invited many of his friends to participate in this new venture, including psychologist, Dr. Carl Jung; sinologist and translator of the I Ching, Richard Wilhelm; theologian, Paul Tillich; German novelist and Noble prize winner, Hermann Hesse; and, Noble prize winning Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore. It was a very auspicious beginning...<br>
<br>
Count Keyserling was one of the first Western philosophers to conceive and promote <span style="color:#FF0040">a universal planetary culture</span>, beyond nationalism, but preserving cultural diversity. <span style="color:#BF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">He promoted a new world order</span></span> based on recognition of the equal value of non-western cultures and philosophies...<br>
<br>
..he promoted a type of aristocratic rule inspired by Plato’s Republic. Count Keysering was the first to coin the term Führerprinzip, for leadership principle. He thought that certain “gifted individuals” were “born to rule” on the basis of Social Darwinism. ..<br>
<br>
The Nazis responded with what Keyserling called a campaign of vilification against him and the School of Wisdom. The Count kept on writing and speaking out. When Hitler came to power the Nazi government revoked Herman’s citizenship because he was an immigrant from Estonia. The Nazis also revoked the citizenship of his two sons, even though they were born in Darmstadt and even though they were the great grandsons of Bismarck. The Count kept writing and speaking out. ...<br>
<br>
Mantle Passes to Arnold Keyserling (1922-2005)<br>
<br>
..Although Arnold was greatly influenced by his father, he pursued his own spiritual path. At the time of his father’s death this primarily meant the ideas and exercises of <span style="color:#FF0040">Gurdjieff. Arnold and his wife to be were very close to George and always spoke of Gurdjieff with high praise and even wonder. </span>Although Arnold was pursuing his own path, he did so in a similar manner to his father. He travelled extensively around Europe both during and after WWII. He even travelled to the Far East and ended up living in Calcutta, India from 1959 to 1962.<br>
<br>
After his return to Austria in 1963, and appointment as a Professor at the Academy of Art in Vienna, Arnold became known in the late 1960s as the first “New Age” philosopher in Europe. Arnold Keyserling developed a systematic planetary philosophy which incorporated all of the world’s great traditions, East and West. He taught students to think for themselves to find personal meaning and fulfillment. His teachings always included and emphasized Greek philosophy, especially Pre-Socratics and Socrates himself. Arnold as a Professor taught the history of philosophy, both Western and Asia. His own work was a kind of combination of Socrates and Pythagoras and always included numbers and basic math charges with symbolism. Arnold’s ultimate work as a philosopher  a new type of reconnection to the Universe that included both science and the ultimate values of all religions. His work also included traditional studies of time patterns that followed archetypes and consciousness in a complicated symbol he called “The Wheel.” The symbol included the Nine Step Enneagram that he learned from Gurdjieff...<br>
<br>
They were not only one of the first to introduce the practice of Yoga in Europe in the 1960s, but also the first to introduce the Human Potential movement and Native American shamans in the 1970’s and 1980’s. In the 1980’s Arnold was elected President of the European Association of Humanistic Psychology. He seldom used the name School of Wisdom to teach in those days, but would talk about the School itself and some of its ideas...<br>
<br>
..By the 1990s he was teaching all over the world in Human Potential and New Age workshops. Like his father Arnold disliked and avoided academic events. Like his father Arnold had an innate talent for speech. ...<br>
<br>
Arnold was heavily influenced as a young man not only by George Gurdjieff, who was his first outside teacher, but then by Ramana Maharishi, and Josef Matthias Hauer (mystical 20th Century composer who started 12-tone music)...<br>
<br>
In the 1990s the focus of the School of Wisdom changed again. In the early 1990s there was a flurry of in-person lectures, seminars and public events by Arnold Keyserling in the U.S., Europe and Asia. One of Arnold’s main messages at that time was that the future would be dominated by technology, especially computers. Unlike most everyone else at the time, he called the Age of Aquarius the Age of Technology. He was especially impressed by the potential of the then new Internet to promote a new world culture.<br>
<br>
Some of Arnold’s students were advanced technologists, programmers and early online adopters. By the mid-1990s Arnold wanted to turn control of the School of Wisdom over to his American students, at least the ones who understood his ideas (by this time one was co-writing books in English with Arnold). He thought they had the kind of special computer expertise needed to keep the School of Wisdom relevant... The Americans agreed to Arnold’s request. They thought that the Internet could be a personal, living instrument of transmission. And that is could help others to improve their understanding of spirit on their role in the world. Arnold, then in his mid-seventies, happily became a figurehead, inspiration and dear friend of the School of Wisdom. At that transition time greater emphasis was already being placed on Music, Meditation, Healing, New Science, Chaos Theories, Law, Technology and Cyberspace. The Americans continued this direction.<br>
<br>
In the mid-90s the Internet was just starting to become a global presence. Arnold loved the idea of the Internet. They gradually switched all of the School’s activities to the Internet. The School has at all times since 1996 provided free online information 24/7 concerning the ideas of the Keyserlings and still evolving ideas of the School itself. That included information from wisdom teachings around the world, both ancient and modern, including science and psychology. The purpose of the information provided by the School of Wisdom was not to provide anyone with answers. The purpose was to provide people with tools by which they could find their own answers, their own understanding. Each person was free to find the teachings and traditions that spoke to them. The School wanted to help everyone to find their unique work for Humanity and the Earth. It was a goal of meaningful work and personal, spiritual realization...<br>
<br>
Providing information on self discovery tools apparently helped some students around the world. But only those with strong self-initiative and other training. Since the online community element did not materialize, the usefulness of the Online Era slowly faded. <span style="color:#FF0040">After Google was perfected the need for a reference tool like the School of Wisdom also decreased.</span> Anyone could find any information they might need via Internet. The School of Wisdom’s prior information service activities eventually became obsolete. Over time so too did much of the information they shared. Thus the need for the School to reinvent itself again in 2017. <br>
<br>
School of Wisdom Today – 2017 Forward<br>
<br>
The School of Wisdom awakens and reinvents itself again. A new iteration begins. We are still focused on wisdom, on practices, meditations and personal understanding, and not on ideologies. But the times have changed and entered a dangerous era. Political conditions are similar, at least in a fractal recursive manner, to that endured by Hermann Keyserling under the National Socialists. We realize that we must speak out now before free-thinkers like ourselves are outlawed and persecuted. We must add a political dimension to the School of Wisdom. We cannot be a living instrument of transmission without it. Political action is now part of our essential mission statement.<br>
<br>
We will be political, but, at the same time will retain our outsider status. We will not be a part of any political party. We do so for the same reasons the School of Wisdom has always been independent, it allows for  better leverage to change the world, both inside and out.<br>
<br>
The School of Wisdom will continue to oppose ideologies in all forms and by any parties, but our political focus will be on opposing Big Brother type governments.The Keyserling family paid a heavy price for Herman Keyserling’s opposition of Hitler, so did the School itself, so did the whole world. This sacrifice must never be forgotten. This terror must never be allowed again. The open angel will prevail over the swastica.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Forum for Stable Currencies is a political advocacy group in the United Kingdom seeking economic democracy through freedom from national debt. Founded in 1998, the group is a non-governmental organization without governmental funding.[1] In 2003, the New Statesman reported that the forum was "attracting leading figures from the world of small business and across the political spectrum."[2] 2006's Market, Schmarket: Building the Post-capitalist Economy refers to the efforts of the Forum to "democratize the process of money creation" as "sterling work."<br>
<br>
In 1998, Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley, motivated by his opposition to usury, and<span style="color:#FF0040"> Sabine K McNeill, a mathematician and system analyst, created the Forum for Stable Currencies at the House of Lords</span>.[4] It was the outcome of contacts with the Christian Council for Monetary Justice and organising the Campaign for Interest-Free Money through weekly meetings at the Global Internet Cafe near Piccadilly, London. McNeill had started the first Local Exchange Trading System in London in 1989 and organised Forum meetings mainly at the House of Lords, but also at the House of Commons under the auspices of Austin Mitchell MP. There, on behalf of the Forum, Austin Mitchell MP tabled Early Day Motions relating to public credit. The first submission to the Treasury Select Committee was entitled "Green Credit for Green Purposes"<br>
<br>
The Forum has hosted notable speakers, including Joseph Huber who on June, 2001 delivered a speech before the Forum at the House of Lords detailing the advantages of economic reform,[5] and<span style="color:#FF0000"> Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus</span> who in February 2008 spoke at <span style="color:#FF0040">St. James's Church, London Piccadilly</span>. Other speakers have included James Gibb Stuart, Bernard Lietaer, Margrit Kennedy, Michael Rowbotham, and Stephen Zarlenga...<br>
<br>
In 2009, the Forum's Early Day Motion addressed the Enforcement of the Bank of England Act 1694 which was written with the intention not to oppress Their Majesties' subjects.<br>

<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Muhammad Yunus spoke at St. James’s Church in London on February 16th 2008 </span>about themes related to his latest book "Creating a World without Poverty – Social Business and the Future of Capitalism". Dr. Yunus had arrived for speaking engagements in the UK after having been a guest speaker at the World Economic Forum in Davos.<br>
<br>
In addition to the speech by Dr. Yunus, which ends with a standing ovation, this video of the event also provides extracts of questions asked by a podium of distinguished activists. These included Aubrey Meyer, promoter of Contraction &amp; Convergence, a global, equal-rights-based framework for the arrest of greenhouse gas emissions...<br>
<br>
The Forum for Stable Currencies which hosted the event has been advocating the use of public or ‘green’ credit to address issues of climate change, to finance flood damage and other public purposes by organising meetings and sponsoring 'Early Day Motions' in the UK Parliament since 2002.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Event organiser Sabine McNeill </span>said: “microcredit is for women in Bangladesh what green credit is for Government in the UK: credit without collateral. That means trust and cooperation top-down and bottom-up. We have only one planet and time is running out. If Governments and NGOs don’t deliver, social businesses will, especially when banks and financial institutions begin to think along social objectives.”<br>

			<div class="content">So, yet more links between Hampstead and Pizzagate.<br>
<br>
St. James Church Picadilly &gt; Little St James Island .. coincidence?<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James%27s_Church,_Piccadilly" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James' ... Piccadilly</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>St James's Church, Piccadilly, also known as St James's Church, Westminster, and St James-in-the-Fields, is an Anglican church on Piccadilly in the centre of London, United Kingdom. The church was designed and built by<span style="color:#FF0040"> Sir Christopher Wren</span>.<br>
<br>
The church is built of red brick with Portland stone dressings. Its interior has galleries on three sides supported by square pillars and the nave has a barrel vault supported by Corinthian columns. The carved marble font and limewood reredos are both notable examples of the work of Grinling Gibbons. In 1902, an outside pulpit was erected on the north wall of the church. It was designed by Temple Moore and carved by Laurence Arthur Turner. It was damaged in 1940, but restored at the same time as the rest of the fabric. [1]<br>
<br>
..When, in 1980, <span style="color:#FF0040">Donald Reeves</span> was offered the post of rector, the bishop allegedly said "I don't mind what you do, just keep it open."[citation needed] During that decade and most of the 1990s numbers and activity grew, the clergy and congregation gaining a reputation for being a progressive, liberal and campaigning church. That has continued. The "congregation" rejects that description and prefers "community". It is centred on the Eucharist, the celebration of the principal Christian sacrament. It finds expression in a wide range of interest groups: spiritual explorers, labyrinth walking, Julian prayer meetings, the Vagabonds group (a lively discussion group which takes its name from a William Blake poem and in faithfulness to that text meets in a local alehouse), an LGBT group and many others. The community has actively supported, and supports, the ordination of women to all the orders of the church, the just treatment of asylum seekers and those living in poverty. It celebrates what it regards as the "radical welcome" found in the heart of the Gospels and attested to by the Incarnation...<br>
<br>
Hauser &amp; Wirth, a contemporary art gallery, is running a programme of outdoor sculpture exhibitions in Southwood Garden in the grounds of the church. The first exhibition was of work by the Swiss sculptor Hans Josephsohn, running from September 2009 to January 2010.[10]<br>
<br>
From 23 December 2013 to 5 January 2014 the "Bethlehem Unwrapped" demonstration against the Israeli West Bank barrier featured an art installation by Justin Butcher, Geof Thompson, and Dean Willars, which included a large replica section of the wall. The installation blocked the view of the church, other than a section of the top of the tower, which was stated by church authorities to be part of the point of the demonstration.

In April 1664 the inhabitants petitioned the House of Commons that theirs might become separate parish from that of St Martin in the Fields, and have its own church. Leave was granted to Edmund Waller, who lived in St James's Street, to bring in a Bill, but neither this nor another Bill for the same purpose which was considered in November 1664 proceeded further than the second reading stage. Other Bills introduced in 1668 and 1670 were equally unsuccessful, the chief opponents being the incumbent of St Martin's, and members of the vestry of the parish of St Martin in the Fields...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>St James's is a central district in the City of Westminster, London, forming part of the West End. In the 17th century the area developed as a residential location for the British aristocracy, and around the 19th century was the focus of the development of gentlemen's clubs. Once part of the parish of St Martin in the Fields, much of it formed the parish of St James from 1685 to 1922. Since the Second World War the area has transitioned from residential to commercial use...<br>
<br>
The area's name is derived from the dedication of a 12th-century leper hospital to Saint James the Less.[dubious – discuss] The hospital site is now occupied by St James's Palace.[2] The area became known as "Clubland" because of the historic presence of gentlemen's clubs...<br>
<br>
Notable streets include:<br>
<br>
St James’s Market, St James’s Place, St James's Square, St James’s Street and Little St James’s Street – the site of St James’s Palace was originally the site of St James’s leper hospital in the Middle Ages, named after James, son of Zebedee</div></blockquote></div>

ARTnews released in 2013 its annual list of the largest, most active art collectors in the world : Heather and Tony Podesta ...AND the MOCA TRUSTEE C <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2180576" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2180576</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Collector Chara Schreyer: An eye for art enlivens the L.A. community<br>
<br>
“When you’re an art collector, you need to cannibalize walls,” says Chara Schreyer. She sits in the living room of her Hollywood Hills home beneath L.A.-artist Mark Bradford’s 24-foot wide collage A Thousand Daddies (2008). In the corner, right besides a floor-to-ceiling window, looms Untitled (1969), by revered minimalist Donald Judd, a tower of ten stainless-steel boxes with red Plexiglas surfaces that make the wall glow pink. This sculpture used to be in Schreyer’s Tiburon home, in Marin County—the Los Angeles home, renovated in 2014 with designer Gary Hutton and architect Joe McRitchie, is her newest of five, since homes mean wall space and she puts none of the art she’s bought over the past 42 years in storage. She knew when she found this tiered house with its wide windows that the Judd belonged in this particular corner...<br>
<br>
Schreyer, who belongs to three California art museum boards and has been one of ARTNews’s Top 200 collectors for 16 years running, arrived in Los Angeles in 1952 as a five-year-old who spoke German and Yiddish but no English. Both of her parents, Sala and Max Webb, had survived the Holocaust. Her father would go on to found S-W-S Construction Co., among the largest real estate development firms in California. The company bought up land in Porter Ranch, among other places, building thousands of model homes there, and its success allowed Schreyer to make collecting a lifelong vocation. Her family history permeates her collection. Above her desk in the Los Angeles house hangs a dramatic black-and-white Jeff Wall photograph of her father’s synagogue, Beth Israel on Beverly Boulevard. She installed an elevator up to the office so her father, who turned 100 in March, can visit the photograph whenever he wants, though he still worries that she overpaid for it...<br>

Schreyer returned more permanently to Los Angeles at a moment when the contemporary art scene here, perpetually growing, reached critical mass. Over 50 galleries opened between 2013 and 2016, including places of international repute like Spruth Magers and <span style="color:#FF0040">Hauser &amp; Wirth</span>; new museums opened, too (The Broad, The Main, the ICA). The city’s longtime status as New York’s stepsibling started seeming obsolete. </div></blockquote></div>

The affidavit of Glenis Potts4, in support of the application, deposed that attempts to serve Little St. James at the address given in the order had failed because Little St. James was not located at that address. It was the address of a shopping plaza. OBM caused company searches to be carried out to locate Little St. James. The searches revealed that Little St. James LLC was not registered to do business in the USVI. However, LSJ LLC, the name set  out  on  the  signature  page  of  the  contract,  was  a  company  registered  in  the  State  of  Delaware, USA.

Peter Island is a 720 hectare (1,779 acre)[1] private island located in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). It is about 5 miles (8 km) south-west (195 degrees true) from Road Town, Tortola. .<br>

<br>
This photograph of Robert Maxwell's daughter Ghislaine, pimp to Jeffrey Epstein, has been circulating on Twitter for some time.<br>
<br>
Let me try to put it into perspective ...<br>
<br>
Just a little more than a month after that Save the Children photo was taken, Ghislaine, whose father owned Oxford United, was pictured with Chelsea FC chairman Ken Bates on Oct.19, 1985...<br>
<br>
**Bates made an early fortune in ready-mix concrete, a product that keeps reappearing in many of my threads. Bates associated with many idolised by the right-wing Monday Club.<br>
<br>
He attempted to purchase Tortola, an island less than 30 km from Epstein's Little St. James but failed.**<br>
<br>
Ken Bates was a close friend of David Mellor - ex-MP, chairman of the Government's Football Task Force and junior HO minister who 'forgot' he sat in on a meeting with Brittan and Geoffrey Dickens about PIE.<br>
<br>
Ken Bates was the owner of300-acre Grange Farm, a business which for a while sponsored Bate's other business, Chelsea FC. It even featured on the sort of kit alleged to have been worn by Bate's mate David Mellor during his memorable steamy four-goal night.<br>
<br>
By 1989, Bates' mate Colin Meredith Peters had been convicted under Operation Hedgerow for his part as ringleader in a horrific child abuse ring after a telecoms engineer discovered obscene abuse images.

			<div class="content">I just want to state here that I tend to think that Sabine McNeill was idealistic in her London ventures.. idealistic and naïve.  She ended up going to jail.  I believe that the real criminals didn't.  However I continue to keep an open mind in this complicated tale of spooks and counterintelligence agents...<br>
<br>
&lt;..<em class="text-italics">McNeill had started the first Local Exchange Trading System in London in 1989 and organised Forum meetings mainly at the House of Lords, but also at the House of Commons under the auspices of <span style="color:#FF0040">Austin Mitchell MP.</span> There, on behalf of the Forum, Austin Mitchell MP tabled Early Day Motions relating to public credit. The first submission to the Treasury Select Committee was entitled "Green Credit for Green Purposes"</em>...&gt;<br>
<br>
Austin Mitchell MP &gt; Jimmy Savile<br>
<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/ciabaudo/status/1085558702420226048" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/ciabaudo/status/1085558702420226048</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Meanwhile up north, any self-respecting radio station had to boast of links to Jimmy Savile, and Sir Richard Denby's Radio Pennine was no exception (oh, and just in case I haven't said it before, Dick Denby was the uncle of Barbara Hewson).<br>
<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/ciabaudo/status/1085619861231992836" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/ciabaudo/status/1085619861231992836</a><br>
<br>
Alongside Hewson uncle Richard Denby and <span style="color:#FF0040">Austin Mitchell MP,</span> another founder member at Radio Pennine was Terry Bate. Terry later became a governor of Christ's Hospital School, a 'school like no other' which spawned as many paedophiles as Radio Pennine.</div></blockquote>

Here's a full thread on McNeill and the Forum for Stable Currencies <a href="https://twitter.com/ciabaudo/status/1084937787772678145" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/ciabaudo/status/1084937787772678145</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>An interesting find: Sabine McNeill, recently convicted to 9 years in prison, was a founder member of the Forum for Stable Currencies and worked closely together with McKenzie Friends patron and business associate of Hewson uncle Richard Denby at Radio Pennine, Austin Mitchell.<br>
<br>
McNeill's co-founder was Lord Sudeley, a far-right monarchist and active member of the Monday Club. In 'Right Now!' he called Nelson Mandela a terrorist and maintained Hitler 'did well to get everyone back to work'. <br>
Nice friends, eh?<br>
<br>
Apart from his years at Denby's paedoincubator Pennine Radio, Austin Mitchell also presented Calendar on Yorkshire Television from 1969-77. Here he is talking about his friend Savile who appeared frequently on Calendar. <br>
A man without a clue! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121020153003/https://www.itv.com/news/calendar/update/2012-10-19/austin-mitchell-mp-on-his-friend-jimmy-savile/" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20121020153 ... my-savile/</a><br>
<br>
In 2008, whilst ArchPaedophile Jimmy Savile was still alive and kicking, his friend and 'anti-Jersey MP' Austin Mitchell tabled a Commons motion calling on the UK government to hold an inquiry into Jersey child abuse allegations...<br>
<br>
Allegations centred around horrific reports of abuse at the Haut de La Garenne children's home on Jersey.<br>
A related motion was tabled a year later by John Hemming, supported by Austin Michell and Peter Bottomley.<br>
<br>
Was Austin Mitchell, co-patron of McKenzie Friends with John Hemming, aware at the time that his friend Jimmy Savile was a visitor to Haut de La Garenne as this photo clearly shows, and if so, did he challenge Savile re. these claims?<br>
<br>
John Hemming, along with fellow Liberal Democrat Bob Russell and former Conservative minister Peter Bottomley, said Stuart Syvret had been jailed for 'criticising the Jersey establishment for its failures to enforce the rule of law'.<br>
<br>
Sir Bob Russell shared a flat with Mike Hancock MP.<br>
<br>
It is truly astonishing that Bob Russel should have lived with Mike Hancock in such a teeny-weeny flat and not notice that there was a third person - a female, a Russian, a spy - allegedly living there too, in plain sight! <a href="https://eleanorscottarchaeology.com/els-blog/2018/5/3/the-liberal-democrat-mps-an-alleged-russian-spy-and-a-very-small-london-flat" class="postlink">https://eleanorscottarchaeology.com/els ... ondon-flat</a><br>
<br>
In 2009, the press reported that Stuart Syvret had sought refuge with John Hemming, who was supporting Mr Syvret’s application for protection from the Jersey judiciary. <br>
In 2011, Hemming selflessly tabled another EDM re. Syvret.<br>
<br>
Knowing of Austin Mitchell's close friendship with Savile, his Radio Pennine links and his interest in Jersey abuse, I was pretty gobsmacked to read his incredibly insensitive comments on the 2015 General Election in his constituency of Grimsby.<br>
<br>
Lord Irvine, Tony Blair’s Head of Chambers and Lord Chancellor, remembered Mitchell for his statement: <br>
'... his name is only familiar to me due to attracting headlines ... for declaring Labour will still win Grimsby even if the party selected a ‘raving alcoholic sex pedophile’.<br>
<br>
On the occasion of his retirement in 1999, it was claimed of Ben Birnberg that he would be spending more time campaigning with 'maverick' MP Austin Mitchell for a National Legal Service. He had already made submissions to Lord Irvine.<br>
But who was Ben Birnberg?<br>
<br>
Ben Birnberg was a civil liberties lawyer acting on behalf of Ian Brady after an intro by Harriet Harman’s uncle Lord 'Porn' Longford. <br>
Boateng looked up to Birnberg as his legal hero for defending a man's right to bring back obscene magazines! <br>
I hear Leon Brittan applauding!<br>
<br>
Most importantly in this context, Ben Birnberg represented the Albany Trust, closely affiliated with the Paedophile Information Exchange.<br>
He was also a trustee of the Loudoun Trust.<br>
<br>
Linda McDougall, wife of Austin Mitchell, accused John Prescott of groping her in 1978. ...  <br>
'Don’t worry Linda, it’s the traditional Neanderthal greeting on introduction to a lady'.<br>
<br>
Is it any surprise that Austin kept quiet about Hull paedophile gangs?<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Austin Mitchell was chair of the Fabian Society</span>, with many links to <span style="color:#FF0040">PIE and the world of paedophilia.</span> One member was David Owen who rubber-stamped giving Savile the keys to Broadmoor. And then there was the Harwoman and Hewitt with their Hewsonesque views.<br>
<br>
Interesting at this juncture to see what the blogger Anna Raccoon, erstwhile friend of Barbara Hewson until she saw through her, has to say about McKenzie, McNeil et al ...<br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_Hanbury-Tracy,_7th_Baron_Sudeley" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_Ha ... on_Sudeley</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Merlin Charles Sainthill Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley FSA (born 17 June 1939) is a British peer, author, and veteran monarchist.[1] In 1941, at the age of two, he succeeded his first cousin once removed, Richard Hanbury-Tracy, 6th Baron Sudeley, to the Barony of Sudeley and until the House of Lords Act 1999 sat as a hereditary peer.<br>
<br>
A member of the Conservative Party all his adult life, he was sometime President and also Chairman of the Conservative Monday Club for seventeen years. He is Vice-Chancellor of the International Monarchist League, and President of the Traditional Britain Group..<br>
<br>
At Easter 1985, in conjunction with the century-old <span style="color:#FF0040">Manorial Society of Great Britain</span> (of which he sits on the Governing Council), Sudeley held a conference at his old home, the proceedings published in a volume entitled The Sudeleys - Lords of Toddington, taking the history of his family back to Thomas Becket's murder and ultimately to Charlemagne. On 21 November 2006 he arranged a further conference at the Society of Antiquaries of London on "Visual Aspects of Toddington in the 19th century"..<br>
<br>
Sudeley, as a historian, has written many published essays, including a history of the English gentleman for a German pharmaceutical magazine Die Waage,[citation needed] and has completed a history of the House of Lords to give ascendancy to its Tory as opposed to Whig history interpretation. The book is entitled Peers Through the Mist of Time,[15] the launch taking place at <span style="color:#FF0040">Brooks's Club in London St.James</span>, where Sudeley is an old member, on 28 September 2018. He is also author of a satire on Greek mythology (published in John Pudney's famous Pick of Today's Short Stories) and a quantity of politically-incorrect short stories mostly published in the London Miscellany magazine.[16] In recent years Sudeley style-edited a definitive monograph on Azerbaijan's architecture, translated from the Russian.</div></blockquote>

Manorial Society of Great Britain<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Governing Council of the Manorial Society of Great Britain in 2018 includes the following members of the British peerage and knightage amongst whom one usually hosts an annual reception at the House of Lords.[1]<br>
<br>
The Right Honourable the 10th Earl of Shannon<br>
The Right Honourable the Lord Sudeley, MA (Oxon), FSA<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The Right Honourable Sir Desmond Lorenz de Silva, QC, PC, KStJ</span><br>

Desmond de Silva (barrister) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_de_Silva_%28barrister%29" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_d ... barrister)</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sir George Desmond Lorenz de Silva, QC, KStJ (13 December 1939 – 2 June 2018) was a British criminal law barrister and international lawyer who served as the United Nations Chief War Crimes Prosecutor in Sierra Leone...<br>
<br>
De Silva was called to the bar from the Middle Temple in 1964, and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1984.[1] A member of the Criminal Bar Association and the International Association of Prosecutors, he became one of the highest-profile criminal Queen's Counsel in England. In 2002, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed him as Deputy Prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone, at the level of an Assistant Secretary-General, and in 2005 promoted him to the post of Chief Prosecutor at the higher level of Under Secretary-General. Silva brought about the arrest of Charles Taylor, former President of Liberia, who was convicted of war crimes at the Hague in 2011.<br>
<br>
In 2003, de Silva was sent as envoy by the United Nations Development Programme to Belgrade to persuade Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and his government to surrender indicted war criminals...De Silva's legal expertise included war crimes, crimes against humanity, espionage, treason, drugs, terrorism, human rights, white-collar fraud and sports law. His clients included John Terry, Lee Bowyer, Buzz Aldrin,[5] Harry Redknapp, Ron Atkinson, Hans Segers, Lawrence Dallaglio, Graham Rix and Jamie Osborne. De Silva was a member of the Governing Council of the Manorial Society.[6] In October 2011, with the approval of Prime Minister David Cameron, de Silva was appointed to head a Review into collusion by the security services and other agencies of the state into the 1989 murder of the high-profile Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane. The report was published on 12 December 2012, and acknowledged "a willful and abject failure by successive Governments";[7][8] however, Finucane's family called the de Silva report a "sham."[9] In 2019 the Supreme Court ruled that the official investigation into the Finucane murder was ineffective and failed to meet the required human rights standards. <br>
<br>
He married Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia on 5 December 1987. She was the daughter of Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia and Princess Margarita of Baden, a granddaughter of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and the great-great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. They divorced on 6 May 2010.[13] He had one sister, Helga de Silva, whose son Detmar Blow was married to the late <span style="color:#FF0040">Isabella Blow.</span>..<br>
<br>
Sir Desmond was knighted in the 2007 New Year Honours, and was also a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of Saint John[1] and a Knight Commander of the Royal Order of Francis I.[citation needed] He was sworn in as a Member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in October 2011.[14] On 22 August 2016, Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia awarded him with the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle<br>

..Hounded by creditors, Bickley left Cincinnati in the late 1850s and traveled through the East and South, promoting an expedition to Mexico. The group's original goal was to provide a force to colonize the northern part of Mexico and the West Indies. This would extend pro-slavery interests. In August 1861 The New York Times described the order as a successor to the Order of the Lone Star, which had been organized for the purpose of conquering Cuba and Nicaragua, succeeding in the latter cause in 1856 under William Walker before being driven out by a coalition of neighboring states. At that time the order's prime objective was said to be to raise an army of 16,000 men to conquer and "Southernize" Mexico, which meant making slavery, not legal in Mexico, again legal, while supporting the Knights of the Columbian Star for public office..

That book that Sabine wrote in 1989 with Ian McNeill  "Only Connect" cannot really be found.. except on Amazon where only her name is listed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Only-connect-technology-networking-transformation/dp/1871403006" class="postlink">https://www.amazon.com/Only-connect-tec ... 1871403006</a><br>

<br>
More than 25 years ago, my dear friend Sabine Kurjo McNeill published a book entitled Only Connect.  It made a great impression on me.  She subsequently contributed to my Nurturing Potential magazine.  At that time neither of us could have anticipated the tremendous impact of the world-wide-net on this development of “The art and technology of networking for personal and global transformation” as the subtitle to her book had it...<br>
<br>
But I imagine she must feel as upset and distraught as I do, that at the same time this tool for positive transformation is being used to groom youngsters for illegal sexual activities and crimes against humanity such as are being committed by IS.<br>

GNER’s reliance on Sea Containers revealed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5867150c-dba8-11da-98a8-0000779e2340" class="postlink">https://www.ft.com/content/5867150c-dba ... 00779e2340</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2006:<br>
	GNER, the train operator, is far more dependent than previously thought on support from its parent Sea Containers Group, filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission reveal.<br>
<br>
The revelation casts doubt on GNER’s ability to operate if Sea Containers becomes insolvent.<br>
<br>
Sea Containers – which has its headquarters in London but is listed in New York – warned this week that it expected its auditors to question whether it was a going concern.<br>
<br>
The company had recently insisted that its problems had little impact on GNER’s contract to run trains on the London to Leeds and Edinburgh route.<br>
<br>
But, in its annual report to the SEC last year, Sea Containers revealed that it provided a $55m (£30m) stand-by credit facility to GNER before May 1 last year, when it started its latest, 10-year operating franchise.<br>
