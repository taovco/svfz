Armed conflictAn Avalanche of Violence: Revealing Predictable Patterns in Armed Conflicts <a href="https://falkenworld.com/2021/01/13/armed-conflict-richardson-law-homeland-security-newswire/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook" class="postlink">https://falkenworld.com/2021/01/13/arme ... m=facebook</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Published 13 January 2021<br>
New research finds that human conflict exhibits remarkable regularity despite substantial geographic and cultural differences.<br>
<br>
New work by SFI’s Collective Computation Group (C4) finds that human conflict exhibits remarkable regularity despite substantial geographic and cultural differences.<br>
<br>
In November 1941, two years after the start of World War II, the English mathematician and physicist Lewis Fry Richardson made a startling observation about patterns of “wars and other fatal conflicts.” By analyzing death data from previous clashes, he found a connection between how severe conflicts are and how frequently they occur. This observation, known as <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="color:#FF0040">Richardson’s Law, is what’s called a “scaling law”</span></span>. It suggests smaller conflicts are scaled-down versions of bigger ones. This is surprising because one might think that big conflicts and small conflicts are the results of different kinds of processes and social problems.<br>
<br>
Richardson’s work inspired decades of investigation into scaling laws that describe when and where conflicts arise. Although these scaling laws seem robust and widely applicable, researchers have, to date, produced no compelling, systematic explanation for why they occur. In a paper published recently in Physical Review E, members of the Santa Fe Institute’s Collective Computation Group (C4) and their co-author Christopher Meyers from Cornell University present a new model using data from armed conflict in Africa that explains how conflicts spread over a geographic region. More technically, the model describes the scale-free ways that clusters of violent interactions grow and spread over time and space.<br>
<br>
Battles, revolutions, and other fights in history might seem violent in their own ways, says SFI’s Eddie Lee, a postdoctoral researcher who led the new work, but with the right lens one can identify unifying principles. “Your intuition says each of these conflicts should be a consequence of specific social and cultural dynamics,” says Lee, “but then you do the analyses and you find that in fact these seemingly different conflicts are characterized by the same patterns.”<br>
<br>
..To build their model, the group analyzed data from two decades of armed conflicts in Africa, collected in the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. The dataset, an archive of reported fatal conflicts, includes more than 100,000 events that occurred up to thousands of kilometers apart. Because each event was labeled by when it occurred, where it occurred, and how many people died, the SFI researchers were able to find mathematical rules that connected conflicts across time and geography.<br>
<br>
“We observed amazing regularity,” Lee says. They find that the physical scales of how conflict spread, through time and space, seem intimately related to the number of conflict reports and fatalities, revealing how the geographic and social dimensions of violence are intertwined.<br>
<br>
The scaling relations Lee and colleagues found in the African armed conflict date resonate with other scaling laws including how innovation and crime scale with population size in a city. One way to push this research forward, Lee says, is to see how closely these scaling laws align: “How are patterns that we see in armed conflicts linked to other patterns that we’ve found elsewhere?”</div></blockquote>

Hmm.. scalability is also being studied in the new health digital platforms ...<br>

Arenas was nicknamed "Agent Zero", due to his former jersey number and his late-game shot-making ability. He also was nicknamed "Hibachi", a nod to the small Japanese barbequing device, which literally translates to "bowl of fire."[1] Both names quickly became fan favorites during his time in the Washington, D.C. area. He has also been nicknamed "Gilby."<br>
<br>
..Arenas was suspended for most of the 2009–10 NBA season because of handgun violations stemming from an episode on December 24, 2009, and for subsequent actions that appeared to make light of this episode...<br>
<br>
Arenas has had his own shoe, the Adidas Gil Zero, as well as his own line of Adidas TS Lightswitch shoes. ..

			<div class="content">But let's get back to Falken and Homeland Security &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Ord" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Ord</a><br>
<br>
Robert L. Ord (born November 23, 1968) is an American businessman and the founder of Falken Industries...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ord was born on November 23, 1968. He grew up in the small waterfront private community of Sherwood Forest, Maryland. In 1983 Ord's parents were forced to claim bankruptcy due to a poor business dealing by his father. He focused on self-development through Martial Arts.<br>
<br>
He graduated from Annapolis Sr. High School in 1987 and attended Anne Arundel County Community College and received an associate degree in 1990. Ord attended the University of South Carolina in 1990 to 1993 and obtained an MBA from Templeton University in 1999. Ord studied martial arts from the age of 4 and by 15 had obtained a black belt in Jujitsu and Karate.<br>
<br>
He continued to study all martial arts and was eventually honored into the International Martial Art Hall of Fame in 2000.[1] It was Ord's Martial Art dedication that molded his career into Law Enforcement and Security. Currently, He is considered one of the world's top defensive tactics instructors and<span style="color:#FF0040"> he has developed training programs for the US Army and The US State Department.</span>...<br>
<br>
In 1995 Ord was promoted as Deputy Director of the United States Police Defensive Tactics Association and developed training courses for Law Enforcement organizations around the world.[3] During this time frame, Ord also graduated from the South West Florida Criminal Justice Academy in 2000 and was a Deputy Sheriff for a Florida Sheriffs Department.[4] Ord moved to Culpeper, Virginia and became a Deputy Sheriff with the Culpeper County Sheriffs Department.<br>
<br>
In 2003 Ord founded the Virginia Security company Falken Industries with under $600.00 . He was divorced, living his parents basement and was committed to restarting his life. By 2017 Ord had made over 10 million dollars with his company. Ord provided private law enforcement officers under the Virginia Statute affording Private Security Law Enforcement Power and the tile “Police”.[5] His authority and experience of private police, Police training and Sheriffs office training have been called to examine the VA code on the special powers of the Special Conservator of the Peace, or SCOP.[6] Robert Ord sued the District of Columbia in 2008 and the case gathered national attention. Ord was a Law Enforcement Officer threatened by prosecution of The District of Columbia's gun laws. Ord pursued DC under appeal. United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit. Robert L. ORD, Appellant v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, Appellee. No. 08-7094.Decided: December 4, 2009 Attorney The amicus curiae lawyers, Alan Gura of Gura &amp; Possessky and Art Spitzer of the ACLU National Capital Area, say the D.C. Circuit has adopted too narrow a standard to prove standing, effectively limiting access to the courts.<br>
<br>
On September 4, 2011, The Washington Post highlighted Ords company, Falken Industries and the unique connection and employment for returning US Veterans. Ord later lost this contract due to an employee who subversively stole the contract and was sued by Ord.[11]<br>
<br>
In December 2015, Ord was called as a subject matter expert of Police and Defensive tactics for the Washington Post.[12] The article and its contents later won a Pulitzer prize.[13]<br>
<br>
In July 2016, Falken Industries became a leader in employee treatment and was awarded the number 1 small business organization in 2016 by the Washington Post.[14][15] In January 2017, Falken Industries was awarded a 5-year contract for Security Services for the General Service Administration (GSA) for 2.7 million dollars under contract 'GS07F027GA.' Ords story was highlighted on I Heart Radio in May 2017

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Then comes the doozy at minute 00:01:20 in which Dr. Plotkin acknowledges that he expressed a preference for experimenting “on children and adults who are human in form but not in social potential.”..<br>
<br>
By the time the combination MMR (measles, mumps and German measles) vaccine was introduced in 1971 and Plotkin and his associates did their victory laps, measles mortality rates were exceeding rare. The disease had morphed into a less-virulent form. The second chart does show measles being largely eradicated in the late 1960s after the vaccine was licensed. However, in 1990, with measles quite rare, the Harma industry recommended a second dose...<br>
<br>

ICMEC &gt; Amgen is one of the corrupt members of BioFlorida I had talked about....Amgen gave a crap ton of money to the Podesta group which seems pretty suspicious in and of itself.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Donald I. Templer (1938 – 2016)[1] was an American psychologist best known for ideas on race and intelligence, and his association with the white nationalist group American Renaissance. He was a professor of psychology at <span style="color:#FF0040">Alliant International University in Fresno, California.</span><br>
<br>
Templer developed the Death Anxiety Scale, the best-known scale used to measure death anxiety, in 1970..<br>
<br>
On 17 June 2020, publisher Elsevier announced it was retracting an article that Templer and J. Philippe Rushton had published in 2012 in the Elsevier journal Personality and Individual Differences.[10] The article claimed that there was scientific evidence that skin color was related to aggression and sexuality in humans...<br>
<br>
In 2002, he published the book Is Size Important?, which focuses on variations in human penis size and preferences for penises of certain sizes. He appeared on the Howard Stern Show to discuss this subject in 2007, where Stern referred to him as "Dr. Penis".<br>

<br>
After Wood died, Dwight Standord helped purchase the property for the struggling Balboa University, a deal which was finalized on September 15, 1950. That same year, Balboa University became affiliated with the Southern California Methodist Conference, changed its name to California Western University and relocated to Lomaland. In 1960, the failing Cal Western law school moved from its downtown location to Rohr Hall at Point Loma to join the rest of the school. The law school received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1962. In 1968, California Western University changed its name to United States International University (USIU). The law school, however, retained the name Cal Western. In 1973, the law school relocated from its Point Loma location to the current downtown campus and Pasadena College moved to Point Loma to replace it. USIU moved to Scripps Ranch and in 2001 it merged with <span style="color:#FF0040">California School of Professional Psychology to form Alliant International University.</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mrs. Herabai A Tata<br>
16 Tavistock Square<br>
London, WC1H 9BQ<br>
United Kingdom<br>
<br>
Herabai Tata was born in 1879 in Bombay. At sixteen she married into the Tata family and gave birth to her daughter, Mithan, a year later. In 1909, Herabai became a Theosophist and would often attend Theosophical conventions in Adyar and Benaras, through which she met Annie Besant. In 1911, on a holiday in Kashmir, Herabai met Princess Sophia Duleep Singh. Through discussion with Sophia and literature that Sophia later sent, Herabai became interested in and an active worker for the cause of women's suffrage.<br>
<br>
In 1915, Herabai became Honorary Secretary of the Women's Indian Association (WIA) in Bombay. She was involved in promoting women's right to the Montagu investigation in 1916 and then to the Southborough Franchise Committee. On 2 August 1919, Herabai went to England with Mithan and Sir Sankaran Nair in order to present a memorandum on women's franchise to the Joint Select Committee. In England, Mithan received a place on a post-graduate course at LSE and so Herabai stayed on in England for the next four years while her daughter completed her studies. They stayed at 16 Tavistock Square in London from November 1919 to March 1920.<br>

Theosophical Order of Service (T.O.S.), Mumbai Region  <a href="http://www.tos-mumbai.org/aboutus.htm" class="postlink">http://www.tos-mumbai.org/aboutus.htm</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Theosophical Order of Service (T.O.S.), Mumbai Region is doing good work for the underprivileged and for the education of poor children and welfare of their families, since the year 1969. Our Trust was registered in the year 1977 with regn. no. INS/11951, under Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950-E-4385 (Bom). We are registered under section 12-A of Income Tax Act, 1961. At present, we are helping 525 poor and deserving children for their education and there are many poor children on the waiting list.<br>
<br>
Planning Commission of Government of India, New Delhi has listed Theosophical Order of Service (T.O.S.), Mumbai Region as one of the good/valid Non-Governmental Organisations in India. We are also recommended by <span style="color:#FF0040">Save the Children Fund</span> (U.K.), India Office, New Delhi.<br>
<br>
It is pertinent to mention here that Dr. Annie Besant the world renowned Philanthropist, pioneer of Home Rule Movement in India, President of National Congress and International President of the Theosophical Society, founded T.O.S. in the year 1908 to give practical expression to the lofty Teachings of the Theosophical Society TRUTH, LOVE AND BROTHERHOOD, with the main object of alleviating human misery and suffering from this world.<br>
The motto of Theosophical Order of Service is "A Union of all who love in the service of all that suffers".<br>
<br>
Another noteworthy achievement of T.O.S. Mumbai Region is the holding of Annual Colloquia - Educational Training Camps-especially for training the youths for five days usually at one of the hill stations of Maharashtra State. In these Colloquiums, the rich and the poor, the young and the old, the highly qualified and the mediocre completely forget their differences and learn to lead a perfect community life in real spirit of Brotherhood. It is a great boon to the so-called backward class delegates to learn good manners, gain confidence to unfold their latent talents, aspire to be good citizens and become useful human beings.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Epstein, who, in addition to his obsession for pretty girls and young women, had a fascination with abstract concepts and liked to associate with some of the brightest minds in the world, including theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould and molecular engineer George Church.<br>
<br>
He was also friendly with Nobel Prize-winning <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="color:#FF0040">physicist Murray Gell-Mann</span></span>, a professor at the University of New Mexico in the 1990s and early 2000s, and a co-founder of the Santa Fe Institute.<br>
<br>
In his 1994 book “The Quark and the Jaguar, Adventures in the Simple and the Complex,” which explored the connections between the laws of physics and the natural world, Gell-Mann thanked Epstein for his donations to SFI in support of his work.<br>
<br>
A recent New York Times report says that Gell-Mann, who died in Santa Fe in May, was among Epstein’s guests at dinners and scientific conferences.<br>
<br>
The Times article cited two scientists and a financial adviser as saying that starting in the early 2000s, Epstein told multiple scientists and businessmen about his “ambitions to use the New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would give birth to his babies.”<br>
<br>
An SFI brochure hails the institute as “the first research organization dedicated to the science of complexity” and the preeminent one, having inspired dozens of other centers focused on studying complex systems.<br>
<br>
..“Currently, leadership is still discussing how best to make a donation of the $25,000,” she said, adding that there are legal complications when one nonprofit 501(c)(3) group like SFI contributes money to another nonprofit. “It’s not as easy as writing a check.”<br>
<br>
Asked who in leadership would make the decision, Marshall said it would be the <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">SFI president since 2015, David Krakauer,</span></span> vice president Jennifer Dunne and the SFI board of directors. She said there was no timeline as to when the donation would be made.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Wisconsin Idea Theatre was essentially a cultural program, developed at the University of Wisconsin c. 1943. It was headed by <span style="color:#FF0040">Robert E. Gard within the College of Agriculture</span>, with a mission for developing theatre arts throughout the state. Gard worked with anyone that had an idea, to develop radio dramas, or stage performances. He worked with 4-H, seeking to develop children's theatre within the state, as well as encouraging and assisting faith groups to develop dramas based on their faith.<br>
<br>
The Wisconsin Idea Theatre began when Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and Charles Van Hise attended the University of Wisconsin. They were close friends, both influenced by the progressive ideals of economics professor John Bascom. La Follette went on to become governor, while Van Hise became President of the University. They had a mutual vision of a government "infused with the talent of trained professionals, guided by the expertise of our wisest scholars and answerable to an active and well-educated citizenry."..<br>
<br>
In order to realise this ideal, they turned the University towards educating not only its students, but encouraging and teaching residents across the state. Correspondence courses were offered, along with traveling faculty. The Governor held regular meetings with the professors of the University to keep in touch, and to encourage their progress.[1]<br>
<br>
Van Hise's successor, President Glen Frank, had a passion for expanding the arts, and hired Dean Chris Christensen to head the College of Agriculture, hoping to encourage farmers, and their families to be more creative.[1]<br>
<br>
Christensen then hired Aldo Leopold, a well-known conservationist, John Stuart Curry, an artist, and Robert E. Gard. It was Gard that founded the Wisconsin Idea Theatre.</div></blockquote>

legend that the <span style="color:#FF0040">Knights of the Golden Circle</span> sowed the dragon's teeth of<br>
treason in the upper Midwest during the Civil War years. It was a Cincinnati<br>
resident, George W. L. Bickley, who charted the Golden Circle on paper during<br>
the late 1850's and later pretended it was an actuality. .. Claiming to hold a medical<br>
certificate from the University of London —this was a bare-faced lie3<br>
 —he<br>
secured an appointment as lecturer at the<span style="color:#FF0040"> Eclectic Medical Institute</span> and his<br>
history of Tazewell County's settlement and Indian Wars was published.4<br>
 He married a widow, tapped her resources for his diverse schemes, and thereby<br>
achieved a semblance of respectability</div></blockquote></div>
