<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Planes full of underage migrants are secretly flown to the New York suburbs as part of an effort by President Biden’s administration to quietly resettle them in the region, The Post has learned. The charter flights originate from Texas, where the ongoing border crisis has overwhelmed local immigration officials, and have been underway since at least August, according to people familiar with the matter. Last week, The Post saw two planes land at Westchester County Airport, where most of the passengers who got off appeared to be children and teenagers, with a small portion appearing to be men in their twenties.<br>
<br>
Westchester County cops stood on their feet as passengers – whose flights arrived at 10:49 p.m. Wednesday and 9:52 p.m. Friday – got off and piled onto buses. Some of them were later seen meeting with relatives or sponsors in New Jersey, or being dropped off at a residential center on Long Island. Post analysis of online flight tracking data suggests that around 2,000 migrants caught after sneaking into the United States from Mexico have arrived at the airport outside White Plains on 21 flights since. August 8.<br>
<br>
Records show some of the planes landed between midnight and 6:30 a.m. – when a voluntary curfew is in effect – with two Houston arrivals at 2:13 and 4:29 a.m. on August 20.<br>
Immigrants from the southern border get off a charter bus at the Mercy First Facility in Syosset, NY, October 16, 2021.<br>

The clandestine nature of the operation raises questions about how the White House is handling the increase in the number of unaccompanied minors...<br>
<br>
A source close to the operation at Westchester Airport said migrants usually arrive with backpacks and are transported by bus to places such as the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, upstate Newburgh. and Bridgeport and Danbury in Connecticut. On Friday evening, a bus left Westchester Airport and hurtled down the Hutchinson River Parkway – closed to commercial vehicles – at speeds above 75 mph before crossing the Throgs Neck Bridge. At around 12:30 a.m. on Saturday, he stopped in Syosset, Long Island, on the campus of<span style="color:#FF0040"> MercyFirst</span>, a nonprofit organization sponsored by the <span style="color:#FF0040">Catholic Sisters of Mercy</span> that provides housing and services to “children and adolescents with problems. company, ”according to its website.<br>
<br>
Immigrants from the southern border get off a <span style="color:#FF0040">World Atlantic Airlines</span> plane last week. MercyFirst has a contract to provide the federal government with residential services for “immigrant youth,” according to the site. MercyFirst CEO Renee Skolaski did not return a request for comment. Later on Saturday, a similar scene began to unfold in Jacksonville, Florida, where numerous flights from Texas landed before continuing on to Westchester – and where The Post saw a Boeing 737-700 land shortly after 10 p.m. at Jacksonville International Airport. . Flights from Texas bring unaccompanied migrant children to New York and Florida...<br>
<br>
As local cops stood nearby, a group of 10 to 15 people wearing matching white baseball caps and carrying duffel bags got off the plane and boarded a charter bus near a cargo terminal in sleep. After a two-hour drive, the group arrived around 1 a.m. Sunday at the Twin Oaks Academy, a juvenile detention center in the Apalachicola National Forest near Tallahassee, where staff members were waiting to open. a door topped with barbed wire...</div></blockquote></div>

It had been founded by Cardinal Wiseman and Dr Manning (later Cardinal) who placed it under the charge of the SISTERS OF MERCY, four of whom had recently returned from the Crimea where they had worked with Florence Nightingale. The Committee of Management included, among others, Cardinal Wiseman and the Duke of Norfolk).<br>

In 1861 the Hospital became closely associated with the Sovereign Military Hospitalier Order of St John of Jerusalem (commonly known as the Order or the KNIGHTS OF MALTA).<br>

This would be the point to end this particular thread as the next post will take us to the strange parallel world of the London music scene of the Eighties during Thatcher's reign and a Goth group called the Sisters of Mercy, spooks, Oxbridge and then to New York, the Democrats and Joel Davis.<br>

Adrenochrome Lyrics:<br>
<br>
We'll turn away in a passive decision/ We'll take the steps through the unmarked door/ A look back for another collision/ But the boys of the spires/ Are boys no more/ Not black and red boys/ Frightened by the night/ By the catholic monochrome/ The catholic girls now/ Stark in their dark and white/ Dread in monochrome/ The sisters of mercy/ High tide/ Wide eyed/ Sped on adrenochrome....<br>
<br>
For the sisters of mercy/ Filled with/ Panic in their eyes/ Rise/ Dead on adrenochrome..... <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sistersofmercy/adrenochrome.html" class="postlink">https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sisters ... hrome.html</a><br>
