US Rep. Donald Edgar Lukens: deliniquent girls, <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
edited for length<br>
The first sex charge against Donald Edgar Lukens emerged when he was  a college kid. He was investigated for <br>
child molestation in 1954, but the parents declined to file charges. That same year, Lukens graduated from Ohio State Univ with a degree in sociology and joined the United States Air Force. He was 23 years old, having been<br>
 born in Harveysburg, Ohio 1931. He became a captain and served six-and-a-half years with the service, <br>
specializing in criminal investigation and counterintelligence, and was later a member of the Air Force Reserve. Thirty-five years later, when Lukens was well into a political career, an aide revealed the criminal investigation <br>
from his past. It was only in relation to another allegation, however, and by that time Lukens was well on his way <br>
to getting thrown out of office and into a jail cell.<br>
<br>
After his time in the Air Force, Lukens (who nicknamed himself "Buz" out of distaste for his given name) became a minority counsel for the House Rules Committee. In 1963, he became the chairman of the Young Republicans. <br>
Lukens was an ultraconservative, and this post marked one of a series of victories that swayed the party farther <br>
to the right at that year's convention. New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, even accused Lukens and his compatriots of using the "tactics of totalitarianism" at the convention. At one point, Lukens was accused of <br>
promoting biased journalism for advocating the injection of 100 Young Republicans into media jobs. He led the <br>
org for two years, which included active stumping for  presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lukens remained in Ohio and began serving in the state senate in 1971. This service was nearly cut short a few <br>
years later. He was barred from consideration in the Republican nomination for governor in 1974 after failing to<br>
 file a 1972 campaign finance report. Lukens said he had done so and that the document must have gotten lost<br>
 in the mail. The next year, however, he was nearly banned from running for re-election under a campaign<br>
 financing law penalizing people who did not file such reports in time. The law was amended in time for him<br>
 to win re-election in 1976. In 1984.  Lukens finally left the state senate after 15 years when he was elected <br>
to the House again in 1986, as well as re-election in 1988. During this second stint in Washington, he opposed <br>
the continuation of sanctions on apartheid-era South Africa and supported continuing aid for Nicaraguan contra rebels.<br>
<br>
Lukens' fall from politics began in February of 1989, when he was indicted on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a child. The charge was only punishable by a maximum of 180 days in <br>
jail and a $1,000 fine, but it was essentially another child molestation accusation.<br>
<br>
The mother of a 16-year-old girl had gone to Columbus television station WSYX regarding the matter and agreed <br>
to have the station secretly videotape a meeting between her and the representative. The two met at a McDonald's fast food restaurant, where the woman questioned Lukens about past sexual encounters with her daughter. One occurred in 1985, when the girl was 13; the other in November of 1988, when she was 16. The mother found out about the incidents after overhearing a conversation between the girl and her friend.<br>
<br>
When confronted with the allegations at the restaurant, Lukens said he didn't know at the time that the girl <br>
was underage. He then said he would see if he could find a government job for the woman. It was a rather <br>
baldfaced effort to keep things quiet, but the FBI determined that there wasn't enough evidence for a bribery <br>
charge. Lukens denied the charges when they first came up, suggesting that he was set up and approached for <br>
money on a general allegation.<br>
<br>
The trial began in May of 1989. The girl testified that she told Lukens she was 19, but that he had laughed it off <br>
and responded, "No, you're not." she described the second time they met to have sex. As the girl told it, she and <br>
her 19-year-old friend went to Lukens' apartment, where the congressman greeted them wearing nothing but his boxer shorts. Lukens asked them to get changed into black robes (commenting that the white robes he had <br>
were for "white people, other kind of people;" both girls were black). They slept together, and Lukens paid <br>
her $40 and gave her birthday gifts of a pink lace fan and a silver pillbox. He also gave her friend $30, a bottle <br>
of perfume, and a diamond pendant and compensated the duo for cab fare.<br>
<br>
The defense attacked the girl's mother as chronically unemployed and desperate for publicity and money, but to <br>
no avail. The jury found Lukens guilty after one-and-a-half hours of deliberation. Chalmers Wylie, senior Republican representative from Ohio, called for his resignation immediately. The verdict came down at about the same time <br>
as another girl accused Lukens of paying to have sex with her five or six times in 1985, when she was 15. "I refuse <br>
to allow the lies and deceit of one delinquent individual to ruin me," Lukens said in a statement responding to the verdict. "I am now fighting for my life." He went on to say that the girl had "fantasies about 'getting even with the establishment.'"<br>
<br>
In June, Lukens was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine, along with sex offender counseling and testing f<br>
or sexually transmitted diseases. The sentence was stayed while Lukens appealed, seeking to have the girl's school and juvenile records admitted for consideration by the court. The girl in the case wasn't exactly an angel. A month after the trial, she was in a fight with a man and the preliminary investigation determined that she was a courier <br>
for cocaine, money, and guns. In August, her mother had her arrested after a fight between the two resulted in threats and the girl breaking in a door with a crowbar.<br>
<br>
The judge and prosecutor had clearly had enough on this score, however. Prosecutor Rita Mangini said the girl's<br>
 "prior unruliness" did not factor into the case. Judge Ronald Solove declared, "The court is particularly struck by<br>
 the unwillingness of the defendant to recognize that he was not the victim" and the ridiculousness of the idea that he was "somehow seduced by a child." Prosecutors also threatened to pursue felony charges related to Lukens' 1<br>
985 conduct if his appeal of the misdemeanor was successful.<br>
<br>
The legal fight came at about the same time that Lukens had to go through the normal run for the GOP nomination. The Ethics Committee said it would look into whether Lukens violated any House rules, along with Democratic congressmen Gus Savage of Illinois (accused of molesting a Peace Corps volunteer during a trip to Zaire) and Jim Bates of California (accused of sexually harassing female staffers). Vice President Dan Quayle, in a trademark <br>
gaffe, caused snickers at a Young Republicans meeting when he accidentally used Buz Lukens' name instead of Buzz Aldrin when referring to the 20th anniversary of the Moon landing; the St. Louis Dispatch quipped "Quayle Puts Sex Offender on Apollo 11."<br>
<br>
With the convention approaching, Lukens finally gave a curt mea culpa: "I apologize. I made a dumb mistake. I'm sorry." He came in third place in the May primary, with 17 percent of the vote. The nomination, and subsequent<br>
 series of elections, instead went to state representative John Boehner.<br>
<br>
One month later, Lukens' appeal was rejected by a state court. He finally resigned on October 24, 1990 "for <br>
the good of Congress and the integrity of the institution." Even then, it took one last incident to force him out. <br>
A few days before, he was accused of fondling a young female House elevator operator. The resignation saved <br>
him from an inquiry by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. The committee had opted not to pursue an investigation after Lukens' primary loss, but in light of his remaining few months of office and the recent allegations they were ready to reopen the matter.<br>
<br>
In November, the Ohio Supreme Court upheld the verdict. Lukens finally began serving his sentence in January of 1991, but only completed nine days of the month-long sentence; the judge agreed to an early release so he could start attending sex offender counseling. Lukens was not quite out of hot water yet. The girl's mother filed a lawsuit against Lukens, seeking $250,000 in damages, but a judge threw it out in December of 1993 after Lukens could <br>
not be located.<br>
<br>
Then the bribery charges started to poke up again. The House Ethics Committee determined in 1978 that Lukens <br>
had received two $500 gifts from South Korean businessman Tongsun Park (later indicted for bribery) during his <br>
first four years in office. In July of 1994, Pentagon contractor Edward Krishack was acquitted of 16 criminal charges, including one suggesting that he gave Lukens $5,500 to get access to a congressional committee during his last year <br>
in office. Krishack was cleared at trial when it was determined that he gave Lukens the money but that it did not constitute a crime.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not much was heard of Lukens after that. He moved to Texas, taught English as a second language courses, and volunteered with the Red Cross. <br>
