<br>
SwissCovid, Fifa, resignation of Michael Lauber, the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Carbyne 911 &amp; Cie.<br>
<br>
The Attorney General of the Confederation Michael Lauber has finally resigned! He will leave his post on August 31. He formally submitted his resignation last Tuesday evening, a spokesperson for the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPC) announced today on Wednesday. The Swiss Federal Administrative Court (TAF) recognizes in its judgment "that the Attorney General Lauber was guilty of several violations of the duty of office and that the disciplinary investigation (against which he appealed) leads to a formally valid decision."<br>
<br>
At the end of this investigation linked in particular to the three meetings of the Attorney General with the President of FIFA Gianni Infantino (including one that Michael Lauber maintains he does not remember), the Supervisory Authority of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Confederation (AS- MPC) had found serious and repeated violations of the duty of office.<br>
<br>
Concerning only Fifa corruption and fraud cases, there are still about twenty criminal proceedings still open,<br>
<br>
Some additional very disturbing elements to highlight!<br>
<br>
Israeli intelligence has a documented history of sexual blackmail, including pedophile blackmail and placing "backdoors" in technology products for surveillance purposes, one of the well-known cases being Israel's reorientation of the system. PROMIS software, reviewed in part three of the MintPress series on Jeffrey Epstein. Additionally, given that the US intelligence services, especially the NSA, had placed "back doors" in the products of major Silicon Valley companies (a service provided by Israeli intelligence-related technology companies, nothing less)<br>

<br>
The founders of Moderna Therapeutics include Noubar Afeyan of Flagship Pioneering; Kenneth R. Chien of Harvard University and the Karolinska Institute; Robert S. Langer of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rossi [2].<br>
<br>
The start-up operated in stealth mode until December 2012, with a vague website content and employees all subject to very strict confidentiality agreements [2].<br>
<br>
Stéphane Bancel was recruited as CEO in 2011 (he was then CEO of BioMérieux [7]. Moderna benefited from venture capital and was financed to the tune of 40 million dollars by the VentureLabs unit of Flagship Ventures and other private investors between its creation and December 2012.<br>
<br>
In 2013, Moderna Therapeutics and AstraZeneca signed an exclusive 5-year cooperation agreement in March to discover, develop and market therapeutic products based on mRNA to treat serious cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases as well as selected targets in oncology [ 12], [13]. The deal includes an upfront payment of $ 240 million to Moderna, which is one of the highest payments ever made under a pharmaceutical industry licensing deal for a drug never tested in clinical trials.<br>

<br>
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the “guest of honor”, ​​and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $ 2 million into Carlyle's $ 1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $ 2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time. [23] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11 attacks,<br>

PA Consulting Group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA_Consulting_Group" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA_Consulting_Group</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>PA Consulting Group (formerly Personnel Administration) is a consultancy that specialises in strategy, technology and innovation. Founded to support the UK’s war efforts in 1943 by Ernest E. Butten, Tom H. Kirkham and Dr David Seymour, who had codified a human-centred approach to boosting productivity, PA grew to become the world’s largest management consultancy by headcount in 1970...<br>
<br>
Today, PA employs more than 3,200 people globally. It is has also acquired seven specialist consultancies and innovation firms since December 2017 - Nyras, a UK-based international aviation consultancy;[3] Sparkler, a London-based digital insight and strategy consultancy;[4] Boston, Massachusetts-based Essential Design, an innovation strategy and product design business;[5] London-based We Are Friday, a digital service design and engineering agency;[6] 4iNNo, an innovation company based in <span style="color:#FF0040">Cincinnati, Ohio</span>;,[7] Astro Studios, a brand strategy and product design agency based in San Francisco California,[8] and Cooper Perkins, a technology development and engineering company with offices in Boston and San Francisco...<br>

PA has also produced the first two Global Threat Assessments for WePROTECT...<br>
<br>
The company is privately held, with 65% of shares owned by Jacobs Engineering Group and the remaining 35% owned by current and former employees..<br>
<br>
On 31 December 2013, Jon Moynihan retired as executive chairman,[35] and was replaced by Marcus Agius, the former chairman of Barclays Bank.[36] In March 2014 the company launched a new logo (the third in its history), a new visual identity and redesigned website.[37] Also in March 2014, Health Select Committee member Sarah Wollaston MP questioned PA Consulting's uploading of a pseudonymised extract of Hospital Episode Statistics to Google BigQuery.[38][39] The Health and Social Care Information Centre confirmed that PA had used the data in accordance with the information sharing agreement in place...<br>
<br>
In 2015, The Carlyle Group bought a majority stake in the company, giving it a value of USD 1 billion.[41][42] Since the Carlyle investment, PA has grown significantly.<br>
<br>
In October 2017, PA started acting on its plans for rapid expansion by relocating its global corporate headquarters. The firm moved from its 25-year home of 123 Buckingham Palace Road, London, to newly built offices at 10 Bressenden Place, taking over two floors of the office block in the heart of Westminster...<br>
<br>
In April 2018, PA's Chairman, Marcus Agius, announced he would step down and assume the role of Deputy Chairman, with John Alexander replacing him. Alexander made the move from environmental and sustainability consultancy ERM, where he took the company through two rounds of private equity funding and grew the enterprise value from US$525 million to US$1.75 billion.[44] The next month, PA bought London-based Sparkler, a leading digital insight and strategy consultancy that works with the like of <span style="color:#FF0040">Microsoft, Diageo and Uber.</span>..<br>
<br>
In December 2018, PA bought another London-based company, the digital service design and engineering agency We Are Friday. They brought with them high-profile digital clients like <span style="color:#FF0040">HSBC, Nuffield Health and the British Red Cross.</span>[6] In the same month, PA also announced it was appointing a new head of its Americas business, Ken Toombs, to drive rapid expansion in the United States. He brought 30-years experience in management consulting and moved to PA from his role as the Global Head of <span style="color:#FF0040">Infosys Consulting</span>...<br>
<br>
Then, in June 2019, PA looked again to the US and acquired 4iNNo, an innovation company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[7] One year later, PA acquired San Francisco-based Astro Studios, a brand strategy and product design agency that works with the likes of Nike, Bose and Facebook.[8]<br>
<br>
Most recently, in November 2020, PA acquired San Francisco- and Boston- based Cooper Perkins, a technology development and engineering company.<br>
<br>
The group announced Ken Toombs as CEO in October 2020, following on from Alan Middleton who stepped down after 13 years as CEO of the consultancy...<br>
<br>
PA's venture programme (PA Group Ventures) was established in 2000 to exploit the ideas and intellectual capital generated from its consulting work.[54]<br>
<br>
Ventures include a third-generation mobile phone business called UbiNetics that was sold for a total of $133 million in 2005;[55][56] and <span style="color:#FF0040">Meridica - a drug delivery system company – that was sold to Pfizer for $125 million in 2004</span>.[57] PA demerged its venture arm, Ipex Capital, in June 2008 although it continues to work closely with the company.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Proof that Romney and “Bain Capital” are agents of the State of<br>
Israel<br>
Mitt Romney An Agent Of The State Of Israel<br>
<br>
By Christopher Bollyn<br>
<br>
6-13-12<br>
<br>
Romney's Israeli Handler<br>
<br>
Orit Gadiesh, former “War Room” assistant to Ezer Weizman and Moshe<br>
Dayan, is the daughter of Israeli Brigadier General Falk Gadiesh (born<br>
Falk Gruenfeld, Berlin, 1921) and his Ukrainian-born wife. Gadiesh is<br>
chairman of the management consulting firm Bain &amp; Company, the parent<br>
company of Bain Capital, and was the company’s managing director under<br>
CEO Mitt Romney in 1992. “She’s like a Jewish mother figure to many of<br>
the people at Bain,” ex-Bainie Dan Quinn told Fortune magazine in<br>
1996...<br>
<br>
Orit Gadiesh, born in Israel in 1951, has worked closely with Mitt<br>
Romney since at least 1991, and probably much longer since she joined<br>
Bain &amp; Company in 1977, when she was 26. Romney appointed Gadiesh to<br>
his transition team when he became governor of Massachusetts in<br>
November 2002. Gadiesh is the daughter of Falk Gadiesh, an Israeli<br>
brigadier general and former member of the general staff who<br>
reorganized the Israeli army in the early 1950s after a stint at the<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<br>
<br>
Falk’s daughter Orit was chosen to serve in Israeli military<br>
intelligence. Her first position in the Israeli military was as<br>
assistant to Ezer Weizman, the deputy chief of staff who later became<br>
president of Israel. During the early 1970s, she worked in the war<br>
room, a bunker where Gen. Moshe Dayan was in charge. As a war room<br>
assistant to Weizman, Orit provided military leaders with documents<br>
and correspondence...<br>
<br>
Prior to joining Bain &amp; Company, Gadiesh served in the office of the<br>
Deputy Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army. Currently, she is on the<br>
board of directors of the Peres Center for Peace, an organization<br>
headed by a former chief of staff of the Israeli military, Lt. General<br>
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak. The high-level Mossadnik Avner Azulay, managing<br>
director of the Marc Rich Foundation, is also on the executive board<br>
of the Peres Center.<br>
<br>
ROMNEY’S INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AND CAMPAIGN ADVISER ­ Mitt Romney named<br>
Michael Chertoff, the Israeli agent who supervised the destruction of<br>
the crucial evidence of 9/11, co-chair of his counterterrorism and<br>
intelligence advisory committee in October 2011. The 9/11 cover-up<br>
continues.<br>
<br>
Mitt Romney attended the Mossad’s “Herzliya Conference on Israeli<br>
Security” in 2007. Romney and the current Israeli prime minister<br>
Benjamin Netanyahu worked together as consultants at the Boston<br>
Consulting Group early in their careers.<br>
<br>
Romney’s close relationship with Orit Gadiesh and Israeli military<br>
intelligence is the real reason he is the chosen candidate of the<br>
Zionist establishment. Romney is being supported by high-level<br>
Zionists, Israeli military intelligence, and their controlled media<br>
network. This relationship between the Israeli military and Mitt<br>
Romney, a presidential candidate, should be of great concern to all<br>
Americans because this is how the Israeli military plans to drag the<br>
United States into a war with Iran.<br>

PACE will contribute to achieving SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production (SCP) by developing solutions for e-waste, plastic pollution and other SCP challenges...<br>
<br>
PACE is co-chaired by the CEO of Philips and the heads of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and UN Environment. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the International Resource Panel, Circle Economy and Accenture Strategy are knowledge partners in this initiative, and WEF hosts and facilitates the platform. Areas of focus include plastics, electronics, and food and the bio-economy. PACE seeks to transform business models and markets across China, Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa.<br>
<br>
Alongside the launch of PACE at WEF, UN Environment announced its cooperation agreement with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The agreement will support joint action by the two organizations to strengthen the scientific basis for policy decisions, including at city level, to decouple economic development from environmental degradation...<br>
<br>
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is a UK-registered not-for-profit organization established in 2010 with the support of several companies including Renault, the National Grid utilities company, and British Telecommunications in cooperation with Cisco. The Foundation’s mission is to promote acceleration toward a circular economy. The Foundation works with business, government and academia to design a ‘restorative and regenerative’ economy.</div></blockquote>

Prince Charles commits to further term as World Jewish Relief patron <a href="https://www.thejc.com/community/community-news/prince-charles-commits-to-further-term-as-world-jewish-relief-patron-1.496812" class="postlink">https://www.thejc.com/community/communi ... n-1.496812</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The prince has taken an active interest in WJR's work since becoming patron in 2015<br>
<br>
The Prince of Wales has extended his patronage of World Jewish Relief for a further term from April 2020.<br>
<br>
Since becoming a WJR patron in 2015, the prince has taken an active interest in its work. He has been especially supportive of its home repairs programme, facilitating life-changing improvements to the dilapidated homes of elderly Jewish people across Eastern Europe.<br>
<br>
Two years ago, he encouraged the charity to launch a campaign to fix 3,500 homes, since when 1,034 have been repaired.<br>
<br>
The charity's relationship with the prince goes back to 2002 when he visited Krakow and met older members of the Jewish community. Six years later, he returned to the city with the Duchess of Cornwall to open the Jewish Community Centre, which was funded by World Jewish Relief supporters.<br>
<br>
It has gone from strength to strength, hosting 160,000 visitors last year and also supports Krakow’s Holocaust survivors and the first Jewish kindergarten opened in the city since before the war.<br>
<br>
The prince was previously patron of the Wohl Livelihood Development Programme in Ukraine.<br>
<br>
At a reception he hosted to celebrate the Jewish community at Buckingham Palace last year, he said he had agreed "without a moment’s hesitation to become patron of World Jewish Relief".<br>
<br>
WJR chair Dan Rosenfield expressed delight that the prince had decided to extend his patronage. "We deeply appreciate his concerns about the ongoing needs of vulnerable Jewish communities throughout Eastern Europe. His vision, inspiration and encouragement has helped World Jewish Relief have a dramatic impact on the lives of Jews in Krakow, Poland and amongst all generations in Ukraine. His ongoing support will enable us to achieve even more.”
