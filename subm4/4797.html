<img src="https://christiansfortruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Rabbi-Raymond-Apple-is-a-well-known-Freemason.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>(Jerusalem Post) Rabbi Raymond Apple — a prominent and high ranking Freemason in Australia — wrote an essay in which he boasted about how smart and admired he is — and how he was able to take advantage of his dual identity as both a Jew and “Australian” to help transform Australia from a prosperous White Christian nation into an economically crippled, multiracial police state:<br>
<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">There is a gap between the role of the rabbi in Israel and the Diaspora. On the whole, the Israeli rabbi is more of a Talmudist and teacher and less of a mentor and minister. The Diaspora rabbi tends to be a professional, concentrating more on people skills, ministering to a congregation and representing Judaism to the host society.<br>
<br>
I was an incarnation of the second concept. Forty-five years in Diaspora pulpits molded me into an ecclesiastic and ambassador. Commencing my career in the United Synagogue in London, I spent 32 years in Sydney as chief minister of the Great Synagogue. Early on, I had a meeting with the synagogue’s Board concerning the role of the rabbi. I said I seemed to have two full-time jobs – congregational minister and community ambassador. I felt I was competent to do either and asked the board what they preferred. Rather pragmatically, they said: “Both!”<br>
<br>
So “both” it remained. I know I wasn’t the perfect rabbi: nobody was or could be. But somehow the combination of roles evolved over the years by previous rabbis (not always in consultation with the lay leaders) seemed to work, and that’s the way things were and remain. Occasionally I asked myself a philosophical question: when I got involved in matters of national debate was it as a Jew or an Australian? Once again the pragmatic answer was “both!”<br>
<br>
The question actually arose constantly. Interviewed on TV in the 1990s (billed as “one of twenty leading Australians”) about the future of the British monarchy in Australia, did I speak as a Jew or an Australian? When I spoke at the national Sea of Hands event at Bondi Beach to advocate reconciliation with (and an apology to) the Aboriginals, was I there as a Jew or an Australian? When I helped the Uniting Church to get its first female military chaplain, was my involvement as a Jew or an Australian? At times I stood up for the Muslim, Chinese and Roman Catholic communities; I addressed conferences of politicians, judges, journalists, nurses, naval chaplains, teachers and child care workers. What was I – a Jew? an Australian? I addressed large audiences on national occasions like Anzac Day and Australia Day – as a Jew? as an Australian? I can’t be sure, but I think the answer was “both!”<br>
<br>
I felt deeply about the quality of Australian society (and still do), about the cleanliness of Australian streets, the decency of Australian democracy, the right of every Australian to a place in the sun, and a range of other issues of our time. I wanted Australia to be a good place for every Australian. I heard from various sources that I was regarded as a sound thinker and a good speaker.<br>
<br>
A Freemason even said I was the wisest man he had ever met – the greatest compliment I ever received.<br>
<br>
A newspaper columnist pondered the possibility of my being governor-general of Australia. He thought it would be complicated though, and he probably had no idea of technical aspects like kashrut, mezuzot and Shabbat.<br>
<br>
Every now and then there were nasty people who called me names, like the yobbos who trailed my wife Marian and me one evening along Park Street in Sydney with a sneering “Jew!” How clever of the yobbos to identify me. I couldn’t escape my Jewishness and didn’t want to. It was because I was a Jew and a rabbi that I came to public notice. I am sure that it was because my thinking was molded and informed by my Jewishness that I had things to say on Australian issues.<br>
<br>
The national chief justice phoned and asked for a biblical verse for the new High Court building. Cabinet ministers (some Jewish, some not) wanted quotations from Jewish ethical writings for their speeches. The Defense Department made special kashrut arrangements for me, and so did Government House. I gave addresses at church synods and on public platforms, and wrote media “op-eds.” I was a full-time Jew and a full-time Australian – at one and the same time. Both? Yes, but it seemed to work.<br>
<br>
What can I say about the Israeli rabbi? He is certainly in Israel – but is he of Israel? Some are. Many are not. Does the Israeli rabbi’s Torah enhance the character and quality of Israeli life? Some rabbis are suspicious of the IDF and regard non-religious Israelis as an enemy. There is little Jewish religious (or spiritual) input in their approach to national and humanitarian issues.<br>
<br>
When we say that this [Israel] is the only Jewish State in the world, the claim is true, but does this show Israel as anything other than a place inhabited by Jews? We know about eternal issues but what about the internal dimension of Israeli life? Where is the Jewish thinking that could influence our political, economic, cultural, intellectual and scientific ethos, even in our sporting life? We talk about the size of the prime minister’s kippah but do we ask how far the Torah tradition could affect the look of Israel? I know many Israelis are scared that the state will become too “frum,” but the Israeli Declaration of Independence expects the state to follow the principles of the prophets and the sagacity of the sages – or is this just motherhood?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
In other words, rabbis in Israel don’t need to take on the role of cultural revolutionary because Israel has already been bolshevized and Judaized — while White Christian nations like Australia have not — at least not entirely — yet.<br>
<br>
And in order to take on this role as revolutionary subversive in Australia, the Judeo-masonic rabbi needs to take advantage of his dual identity, donning whichever hat that the situation demands.<br>
<br>
The ability of Jews to pass as White has been essential to their ability to subvert White nations — once they achieve high social power and wealth, they no longer have to dissemble and can wear their Jewishness without fear — even from the “yabbos.”<br>
<br>
And by their own admission — contrary to what they have long claimed — they were not forced to change their names upon arriving in White Christian lands — they did so on their own volition to better “blend in” and become socially, upward mobile.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Apple helped promote the “rights” of Aboriginals in Australia — not because he really cared about them — but because by doing so, he made Australia more hospitable and accepting of Jews.<br>
<br>
He “dialogued” with Christian churches not so that Jews could better understand how to live in a Christian nation and respect its traditions and values, but rather in order to Judaize those Christians so that they would tolerate Christ-hating malcontents living among them — in complete violation of the commands of 2 Corinthians 6:14.<br>
<br>
All so-called “inter-faith dialogue” is a one-way street for Jews — Christians are forced to tolerate the intolerable, to grovel and compromise our basic commandments from Christ, and accept being called “bigots” and “supremacists” when we don’t cave to Jewish demands that we accommodate their anti-Christ worldview.<br>
<br>
And notice that Rabbi Apple specifically tells us that the greatest compliment he ever received was from a fellow freemason — who extolled how “wise” he is — in case we couldn’t read between the lines.<br>
<br>
In the last 60 years — under the watchful “all seeing Eye” of Rabbi Apple — Australia has gone from a prosperous, safe, homogeneous Christian nation to a multi-racial cesspool dominated by Jewish billionaires — where White Christians are now a minority living under a police state — closely monitored by Jewish watchdogs.<br>
<br>
Any real Australians who object to this “progress” wrought by the rabbi and his fellow Jews and masons can be thrown in jail on trumped up “hate” crimes for expressing any objection to their own disenfranchisement, replacement and destruction.<br>
<br>
That is the blueprint of Judeo-masonry in every White nation.<br>
<br>
And for those who think Judaism is subservient to Freemasonry, the following quotes from mostly Jewish sources prove otherwise; the exact opposite is true — Freemasonry serves Jewish power:<br>
<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">    “Freemasonry is a Jewish establishment, whose history, grades, official appointments, passwords, and explanations are Jewish from beginning to end.”<br>
    –Rabbi Isaac Wise, foremost Reform rabbi in 19th century America<br>
<br>
    “The most important duty of freemasonry must be to glorify the Jews, which has preserved the unchanged divine standard of wisdom.”<br>
    —French masonic magazine Le Symbolisme (July 1928)<br>
<br>
    “Our rite is Jewish from beginning to end, the public should conclude from this that we have actual connections with Jewry.”<br>
    —Dr. Rudolph Klein, (Latomia, No. 7-8, 1928)<br>
<br>
    “Freemasonry is based on Judaism. Eliminate the teachings of Judaism from the Masonic ritual and what is left?“<br>
    —Jewish Tribune newspaper, 1927<br>
<br>
    “Freemasonry is born out of Israel.”<br>
    —The Jewish Guardian, 12 April 1922<br>
<br>
    “Masonry, that immense association, the rare initiated of which, that is to say, the real chiefs of which, whom we must be careful not to confound with the nominal chiefs, live in a strict and intricate alliance with the militant members of Judaism, princes and imitators of the high Cabal. For that elite of the order–those real chiefs whom so few of the initiated know, or whom they only know for the most part under a nom de guerre, are employed in the profitable and secret dependence of the cabalistic Israelites. And this phenomenon is accomplished thanks to the habits of rigorous discretion to which they subject themselves by oaths and terrible menaces; thanks also to the majority of Jewish members which the mysterious constitution of Masonry seats in its sovereign counsel.”<br>
    –Gougenot des Mosseaux in Le Juif, le Judaisme et la Judaisation des Peuples Chretiens, Paris, 1869.<br>
<br>
    “Gentile masonry blindly serves as a screen for us and our objects, but the plan of action of our force, even its very abiding-place, remains for the whole people an unknown mystery.”<br>
    —The Protocols of Zion, 4:2</em></div></blockquote>
