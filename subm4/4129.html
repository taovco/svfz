<br>
Excerpts:<br>
<br>
The director of the Institute of Pathology at the University of Heidelberg, Peter Schirmacher, has conducted more than 40 autopsies on people who died within two weeks of receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and expressed concern about the results.<br>
<br>
Schirmacher said that 30-40% of the people he examined died from the vaccine and that, in his opinion, the frequency of fatal consequences of vaccines is “underestimated”.<br>
<br>
Following his findings, Schirmacher called for more autopsies of vaccinated people to further determine whether vaccines are linked to deaths. He warned that the high number of unreported cases of vaccine-related deaths is partly due to the fact that “pathologists don’t notice anything in most patients who die after vaccination”.<br>
<br>
Despite the criticism, Schirmacher has received support from within his own ranks, and the Federal Association of German Pathologists has said that more autopsies of vaccinated people who have died within a certain time after vaccination should be carried out.<br>
<br>
The head of the association’s “Autopsy Working Group” wanted to raise awareness among general practitioners and health authorities. Basically, doctors of patients who died within days or weeks after vaccination should ask for an autopsy in case of doubt or the health authorities should take action.<br>
<br>
The Federal Association of Pathologists had already requested this in March in a letter to Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU), but it went unanswered.<br>
<br>
Of course, it should be noted that Schirmacher’s warning could cause several pharmaceutical companies to lose billions of dollars in business in the long run, which explains why his conclusions have been criticised and tarnished by those who want to impose the pro-vaccine agenda.<br>
<br>
However, Schirmacher’s reputation and seriousness cannot be ignored.<br>
<br>
Schirmacher himself is already leading a state-sponsored autopsy project on the Covid-19 deceased. He then expanded the focus himself and began to conduct autopsies on more than 40 deceased vaccinees. Although his results represent a small sample, it is a disturbing representation of a larger picture: 30-40% died from the vaccination itself. The pathologist cited “rare and serious side effects of vaccination, such as cerebral venous thrombosis or autoimmune diseases”.<br>
<br>
It will not be surprising to see Schirmacher’s reputation completely trashed in the media in the coming weeks, in line with the corrupt in the scientific and medical community.</div>

			<div class="content">Not trying to nitpick but the headline from that paper is so misleading from the content I just wanted to point out and emphasis that the doctor was talking about 12-16 deaths out of the 40 autopsies he performed, a high percentage so that he recommended more autopsies be done. <br>
<br>
He did NOT say<blockquote class="uncited"><div>“Vaccine causes death in 30-40% of newly vaccinated”</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That is a far cry from the click bait headline: "“Vaccine causes death in 30-40% of newly vaccinated”. (within 2 weeks no less) The headline is on it's face so utterly ridiculous, yet it's been repeated ad nauseum. This actually takes away from the point that the doctor made which is that more needs to be done to get a better sense of determining how many deaths have been happening from the vaccines.<br>
<br>
Relevant:<br>
<br>
Number of vaccinated people in Germany as of Sept. 19, 2021:<br>
 5,586,314<br>
<br>
30% = 1,675,894<br>
<br>
#total covid deaths Germany reported on Worldmeters as of now:<br>
94,585<br>
<br>
Number of projected average daily deaths for 2021:<br>
2,279 <br>
 <br>
2,279 x 281 days as of today = 640,399 estimated deaths as of today (not actual)<br>
<br>
The point is, does anyone believe that no one would sound an alarm if the total of deaths was 1,675,894 (all within 2 weeks of each individual getting vaxxed) when the expected deaths for the entire year from ALL causes would amount to an estimated 831,835? <br>
<br>
 Does anyone believe that the doctor was claiming that nonsense as opposed to simply commenting as to the 12 autopsies that he thought were vaccine deaths and the 4 he suspected were likely to be as well? <br>
<br>
********<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
Also it turns out that 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SCHIRMACHER IS PRO-VACCINE:<br>
Dr. Schirmacher has received the Covid-19 vaccine.<br>
Ausburger Allgemeine notes that Schirmacher “does not want to spread panic.”<br>
The article emphasizes the doctor “is in no way opposed to vaccinations.”<br>
Dr. Schirmacher believes the “[v]accination is an essential part of the fight against the virus.”<br>
‘FEDERAL ASSOCIATION OF GERMAN PATHOLOGISTS’ AGREES WITH SCHIRMACHER:<br>
The Federal Association of German Pathologists is also pushing for more autopsies of vaccinated people, reports Ausburger Allgemeine.<br>
“This is the only way to exclude or prove connections between deaths and vaccinations, says Johannes Friemann, head of the autopsy working group in the association.”
</div></blockquote> <a href="https://archive.is/wip/jJiGk" class="postlink">https://archive.is/wip/jJiGk</a><br>
<br>
So the real number we'd like to know is how many vaccinated people died hours/days or a couple weeks or so after getting the jab?</div>

We will never know because if nothing happens within a few hours, then whatever happens is definitely NOT from the magic potion they want to inject into every single person on Earth.  See the post about Lemon...heart attack has nothing at all to do with getting the jab.</div>
