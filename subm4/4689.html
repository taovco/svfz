Vatican Hides a Transhumanist Event Behind a Private Company during a Meeting on AI Organized by the <br>
Pontifical Council for Culture<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Article by Leo Zagami<br>
<br>
Last week, the Pontifical Council for Culture and the German Embassy to the Holy See hosted what was defined by Vatican News as a “one-day symposium ” looking at “The Challenge of Artificial Intelligence for Human Society and the Idea of the Human Person”.<br>
<br>
The definition “one-day symposium” used in the title by the Vatican News staff writer was deliberately misleading, and repeated in the first sentence of the Vatican News presentation:<br>
<br>
“The symposium on Artificial Intelligence – or AI – organized by the Pontifical Council for Culture, in cooperation with the German Embassy to the Holy See, will open in Rome on Thursday.” <br>
<br>
There is a reason why I accuse the Vatican of being “deliberately misleading,” as the event was not a “one-day symposium” and it was continued in a more reserved manner in the so-called  “ELITE Global Leaders Conference” ( here ) a 3-day conference that was held in Rome in October at The Westin Excelsior, and in the Vatican City  at the  Collegio Teutonico (German College) traditionally linked to the German Embassy, often referred to by its Latin name Collegium Germanicum, one of the Pontifical Colleges of Rome established in 1399 and maintained at the Vatican for the education of future ecclesiastics of the Catholic Church of German nationality. This event, however, was officially organized by private company Jaboy Productions, not the Vatican, and the reason will be explained shortly.<br>
<br>
The official theme for the gathering organized by the Pontifical Council for Culture and the German Embassy, was “The Challenge of Artificial Intelligence for Human Society and the Idea of the Human Person.” The aim of the meeting was said to be to promote better awareness of the profound cultural impact AI is likely to have on human society. The symposium featured six experts from the fields of neuroscience, philosophy, Catholic theology, human rights law, ethics, and electrical engineering. There were experts from the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Goethe University, Boston College, and Google, who discussed questions regarding AI and whether it can reproduce consciousness, AI, and philosophical challenges, and even AI and religion, and what it would mean concerning Catholic doctrine.<br>
<br>
The afternoon panel focused on so-called ethical and legal consequences arising from AI and was addressed by experts from the EU Agency for Human Rights, the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Technology Centre, and the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development. Bishop Paul Tighe, the Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Culture, spoke to Vatican Radio’s Thaddeus Jones about the symposium, but the controversial part came later under the fictional banner of a private event that even Reuters was tricked into believing was <br>
<br>
“Organized by private company Jaboy Productions, not the Vatican.”<br>
<br>
The reason for hiding the official Vatican involvement with the rest of the event was obvious. The event entitled “Elite Global Leaders Conference,” focused on transhumanism as a “technology that empowers humanity,” the keynote presentation allegedly being, “The Code – Programming Our Future For Good.” <br>
<br>
At the conference’s event on the 23rd of October, the two keynote speakers were David Fergusson and Carlos Moreira, authors of “The transHuman Code: How To Program Your Future.”<br>
<br>
Transhumanism refers to the movement to develop human enhancement technologies that integrate into the human body, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.</div>
