			<div class="content">So Twitter was abuzz with news of UK activists confronting Neil Ferguson, the coronavirus modeller, during his recent lecture at King's College London. The full video here: <a href="https://odysee.com/@ResistanceGB:f/heiko-ferguson:1" class="postlink">https://odysee.com/@ResistanceGB:f/heiko-ferguson:1</a><br>
<br>
So, I was interested to know who are the London academics who are still supporting the discredited Ferguson. I've done a few posts on his connections, like: <em class="text-italics">J<span style="color:#00FF40">effrey Epstein's scientists - on the suspension of Martin Nowak at Harvard and the resignation of Dr Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London, coronavirus simulation modeller</span></em> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3805987" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3805987</a><br>
<br>
<br>
The moderator of the event is Professor Evelyn Waugh <a href="http://roarnews.co.uk/2021/who-is-evelyn-welch-kcl-interim-president/" class="postlink">http://roarnews.co.uk/2021/who-is-evely ... president/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Roar writer Helena Kudiabor gives a brief biography of King’s controversial Interim President, Professor Evelyn Welch... Aside from her role as Interim President, she is also the Senior Vice President for the department of Arts &amp; Sciences, and a Professor of Renaissance Studies. Once she graduated from Harvard in 1981 with a BA in Renaissance history and literature, she received her PhD from the Warburg Institute in London. Following this, she taught at various universities in the UK including the University of Sussex and Queen Mary University of London...<br>
<br>
Aside from her academic work, she is the mother of Florence Welch, the lead vocalist of the indie rock band Florence and the Machine.<br>
<br>
Welch first came under widespread criticism following the report published surrounding the 2019 Bush House security incident. At the time, Queen Elizabeth had come to visit King’s, however many student activists were unable to access campus during the visit, leading to allegations of discrimination. Welch was acting Principal at the time and formally apologised. However, she was criticised by many students for only doing so four months after the incident took place, and for prioritising royal over student welfare. ..</div></blockquote>

Here's a weirdly titled article on Florence, written by her father Nick Welch *cough* :<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">She's the achingly fashionable singer from Florence And The Machine. To me she's just the Daffy Diva... but I am her dad </span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1202092/Shes-achingly-fashionable-singer-Florence-And-The-Machine-To-shes-just-Daffy-Diva--I-dad.html" class="postlink">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/a ... I-dad.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Florence was born into an Anglo-American middle-class family. Her mother, Evelyn, is an American art historian and I worked in advertising. We lived in South London, we took holidays in Cornwall. ..<br>
<br>
Because of her mother's work, Florence did have an early exposure to Renaissance painting, which may have had an influence on the somewhat visceral world view expressed in her lyrics. As a child, she was particularly fascinated by Mantegna's Circumcision Of Christ, and by various paintings of the martyrdom of St Agatha, who had her breasts cut off. ..<br>
<br>
One evening a few years ago when I was passing Florence's bedroom I heard her shouting out: 'That's amazing, I'm having a bloody epiphany.'<br>
<br>
I poked my head around the door and saw her sitting on the bed with a huge pair of headphones on. She had, it appeared, just listened for the first time to <span style="color:#FF0040">Jefferson Airplane's White Rabbit</span>. <br>
<br>
..On the basis of her phenomenal performance she was co-opted to sing a rather obscure and difficult Gilbert And Sullivan song at my father's memorial service at St Bride's in Fleet Street in 1997.<br>
<br>
My father, Colin, was a journalist and satirist who had been deputy editor of the Daily Telegraph and a parliamentary sketchwriter for the Daily Mail, so the great and good of Fleet Street were there... After this she became something of a fixture at funerals. When I recently gave her a hard time about the dark quality of her lyrics - the first song she wrote was called My Boy Builds Coffins - she said: 'You made me sing at funerals. What do you expect?' <br>

</div></blockquote>

Yeah, just a random comment about the song White Rabbit..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>James Colin Ross Welch[1] (23 April 1924 – 28 January 1997) was an English political journalist. According to Richard West in his obituary of Welch, he was a "strong and eloquent advocate of individual liberty against the power of government..<br>

Welch was educated at <span style="color:#FF0040">Stowe</span> and Peterhouse, Cambridge, and joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1944, taking part in the Normandy landings in June and fighting until injured in March 1945.

<a href="http://www.yogaesoteric.net/content.aspx?lang=EN&amp;item=6732" class="postlink">http://www.yogaesoteric.net/content.asp ... &amp;item=6732</a> <a href="http://archive.is/zAYnx" class="postlink">http://archive.is/zAYnx</a> "Originally led by the British Secret Intelligence officer, Major John Rawlings, the Tavistock Institute was designed even from the beginning as a coordinating center for the planetary social control using "psychological shock troops" - a term invented by Reese...<br>
<br>
Speaking of economics, lunatics, Tavistock, Fabian Society, Great Britain’s pedophiles and world domination…here is what I wanted to explore the other night, when I ran into such an avalanche of info: The Mont Pelerin Society.<br>
<br>
Citing its lofty reason for existing: “This society would bring together for mutual enlightenment and encouragement the leading figures of classical liberalism. One of the founding members was Karl Popper, George Soros’ inspiration for his megalomaniac mission to enslave the world. <a href="https://watch.pair.com/synarchy-4.html" class="postlink">https://watch.pair.com/synarchy-4.html</a> <a href="http://archive.is/x0omJ" class="postlink">http://archive.is/x0omJ</a> The Mont Pelerin Society and its history helps make sense of the what appears now to be a world on the brink of suicide.<br>
<br>
For example: “Other <span style="color:#FF0040">founders of the Mont Pelerin Society were prominent members of the various Eugenics societies</span>, popular in that era, whose agenda was the race purification and population reduction by means of sterilization, controlled selective breeding and genocide. <span style="color:#FF0040">Sir Antony Fisher, a member of the Fabian Society,</span> founded the Manhattan Institute in 1977 with Friedrich von Hayek. In 1994, Manhattan Institute scholar Charles Murray, co-authored The Bell Curve, a landmark publication advancing the theory of intellectual inferiority of black races. Another founding member of the Mont Pelerin Society was “Ralph Harris, a leader of the <span style="color:#FF0040">British Eugenics Society</span> which had earlier helped draft Hitler’s race laws.”<br>
<br>
“The Mont Pelerin Society, from the outset, was to be a clandestine agency committed to implementing the ‘Hayekian’ Conservative Revolution. “<span style="color:#FF0040">One of the key figures in this effort was Antony Fisher.</span> Born in London in 1915, educated at Eton and Cambridge, Fisher was elected to the Mont Pelerin Society in 1954. The following year, he founded the Institute of Economic Affairs in London, as the first of dozens of front groups for Mont Pelerin that he would help launch. Other IEA founders included von Hayek, who at this point was at the University of Chicago; Ralph Harris, a leader of the British Eugenics Society which had earlier helped draft Hitler’s race laws; Keith Joseph and Allan Walters.”<br>

</div></blockquote>

Colin Welch is also mentioned in this document on Antony Fisher <a href="https://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/upldbook443pdf.pdf" class="postlink">https://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/fi ... 443pdf.pdf</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Copyright: Institute of Economic Affairs. <br>
<br>
When Antony Fisher died in San Francisco on July 9, 1988, aged 73, four weeks<br>
after being knighted in the Queen’s birthday honours list, the world was largely<br>
unaware of him or his influence. ..<br>
<br>
Among MPs generally, probably only a handful were aware of Fisher’s<br>
remarkable influence. Yet in founding the Institute of Economic Affairs, the<br>
London-based free-market think tank, he had played a crucial role in helping to<br>
reverse economic trends that many had judged to be irreversible, thereby<br>
changing the direction of British post-war politics. In creating and nurturing many<br>
similar bodies in other countries he also helped spread the ideas underlying the<br>
Thatcher revolution of the 1980s worldwide. <br>
<br>
But his influence did not end there. The retreat of governments from the<br>
market place under the impact of those ideas in turn made possible the wider<br>
process of globalisation, with its vast potential for transforming economic<br>
conditions and expanding human liberty. And as the political agenda of the<br>
world’s rich nations has increasingly focused on social rather than economic<br>
issues, it has been the think tanks that Fisher founded, or assisted, which have laid<br>
the intellectual foundations of new responses to the problems of crime, juvenile<br>
delinquency, welfare dependency, and poor educational standards. <br>
<br>
The following tribute from Conservative MP Oliver Letwin may actually<br>
have underestimated his influence: “Without Fisher, no IEA; without the IEA and<br>
its clones, no Thatcher and quite possibly no Reagan; without Reagan, no Star<br>
Wars; without Star Wars, no economic collapse of the Soviet Union. Quite a<br>
chain of consequences for a chicken farmer!” ...<br>
<br>
Among senior journalists who acknowledged the IEA’s role in influencing<br>
their views were William Rees-Mogg, Alastair Burnet, Antony Jay, Paul Johnson,<br>
Andrew Alexander, John O’Sullivan, T.E.(Peter) Utley and <span style="color:#FF0040">Colin Welch</span>. These,<br>
however, were merely the best known in a much longer list of journalists who<br>
were crucial in the transformation of the political debate...

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Welch is the niece of satirist Craig Brown[7] via Brown's wife and Welch's aunt, Frances Welch,[12] and granddaughter of Colin Welch (James Colin Ross Welch), former deputy editor of The Daily Telegraph and former Daily Mail parliamentary sketchwriter, originally of Cambridgeshire.[12] Welch's maternal uncle is actor and director John Stockwell..<br>
<br>
During her youth, Welch was encouraged by her Scottish paternal grandmother, Cybil Welch (née Russell),[12][14] to pursue her performing and singing talents..<br>
<br>
Welch was educated at <span style="color:#FF0040">Thomas's London Day School</span> then went on to Alleyn's School, South East London, where she did well academically.<br>

..Nick Welch, her father, contributed a "rock and roll element to the family mix"; in his twenties, he lived in a West End squat and attended the Squatters' Ball organised by Heathcote Williams where The 101ers played regularly.[70] A self-confessed "frustrated performer", if Nick, as he put it, "nudged Flo in any way, it's only been to listen to the Ramones rather than Green Day."[70] Evelyn, Welch's mother, had an equally strong, yet completely different influence on her daughter. A visit to one of her mother's renaissance lectures left teenage Florence deeply impressed. She explained, "I aspire to something like that, but with music. I hope that my music has some of the big themes—sex, death, love, violence—that will still be part of the human story in 200 years' time."</div></blockquote>

Very good @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4289" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">EricKaliberhall</a>. Thanks for the link.  I could smell it on her and there's much more about that family.<br>
Also that school she went to has an interesting past and William and Kate Middleton send their children to it.</div>
