<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Wed Oct 20, 2021 - 2:14 pm EDT<br>
<br>
AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (LifeSiteNews) – A healthy 16-year-old French girl has died of thrombosis within a week of receiving her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  <br>
<br>
Sofia Benharira was a young high school student from Gardanne, a small town located between the cities of Marseille and Aix-en-Provence, in southern France. She received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on September 14 and died as a result of a blood clot on September 21. She had suffered a heart attack at her high school the day before. <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">She had no known pre-existing health conditions. </span> <br>
<br>
Sofia’s aunt, who was also her godmother, gave an interview to  No More Silence, a website dedicated to  sharing stories of people who have suffered debilitating adverse events after taking one of the experimental shots for COVID-19.  <br>
<br>
“She was full of life. She wanted to become a child carer [and] was in her last year of high school,” her aunt told No More Silence. <br>
<br>
The woman, who gave Sofia’s age as 17 although French media has consistently stated it as 16, recalled that on the morning of Monday, September 20, her niece felt ill at school and eventually collapsed.  <br>
<br>
<a href="https://rumble.com/vn3lfv-sofia-benharira-pfizer-died-21st-september-aged-16-years.html" class="postlink">https://rumble.com/vn3lfv-sofia-benhari ... years.html</a><br>
<br>
“The high school called the emergency services, and she was taken to the E.R at Aix-en-Provence’s hospital, as she had suffered from a heart attack,” Sofia’s aunt added.  <br>
<br>
The next morning, at 6 am on Tuesday, September 21, the girl died in the Aix-en-Provence hospital.  <br>
<br>
“We asked for an autopsy because a young, healthy girl doesn’t just die like that,” said her aunt. “Our Sofia wasn’t sick.”   <br>
<br>
The autopsy revealed that Sofia died of a “huge unexplained pulmonary embolism.”  <br>
<br>
Pulmonary embolism occurs as a complication of thrombosis when a blood clot that develops in the body travels to a lung artery where it suddenly blocks blood flow.   <br>
<br>
“We can’t say anything else for sure, [f0r] we don’t know,” her aunt said.<br>
<br>
But many in France suspect that the Pfizer vaccine Sofia received only days before her death was the cause of her death, as heart attacks and blood clots, are listed among some of the vaccine’s most frequent adverse effects. <br>
<br>
“We don’t know each other, but I was saddened by the tragic loss of your daughter. I am outraged by the lies that led to the death of such a young and beautiful woman,” wrote a woman named Lily on Sofia’s obituary page.  <br>
<br>
Pfizer’s COVID shot has been  linked  to blood clotting by Israeli scientists in a June research paper. And as early as December 2020, evidence was emerging that mRNA-developed jabs were associated with dangerous blood clots. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had even been  alerted  to this fact. <br>
<br>
According to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), cardiac conditions also account for a sizable portion of reports. To date, the database shows 8,136 reports of heart  attacks. The system also shows  3,735 cases of  thrombocytopenia, a condition causing low  platelets in the blood and leading to blood clots.  <br>
<br>
“Parents need to be vigilant toward their young children,” warned Sofia’s aunt. <br>
<br>
“It has happened to me, it’s real, so please, parents, look after your children. Think carefully.” <br>
<br>
To date, the No More Silence website  features  236 unique stories of injury from people in 25 countries. A spokesperson for the organization told  LifeSiteNews that everyone featured on the site goes through an extensive verification process before the No More Silence publishes the testimonies. <br>
<br>
No More Silence  also revealed that  the stories featured on the site are  only a fraction of the videos they receive from those who have experienced serious adverse events after taking one of the experimental COVID jabs. Last week, the website published a video testimony of Shelly Sytsma, a 60-year-old woman from Washington state who suffered from pericarditis, blood clots, and deep vein thrombosis after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.    <br>
