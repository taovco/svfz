<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">A Jew who was serving a 30-year sentence for beating an infant almost to death — and then murdering a police officer while attempting to escape from prison with six other inmates — will be granted a new trial in an attempt to overturn his death sentence because — his army of 100 pro bono Jewish attorneys claim — the presiding judge in his trial “hated” Jews for no reason whatsoever:</span><br>
<br>
    Randy Halprin, 44, was originally set to be executed on Oct. 10, 2019 but won a stay from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals after he alleged that the judge who presided over his 2003 murder trial was biased against Jews and referred to him using anti-Semitic slurs, including “f—in’ Jew” and “k-ke.” The stay sent Halprin’s case back to Dallas County, where Judge Lela Lawrence Mays heard Halprin’s arguments in June and this week issued a decision granting Halprin a new trial.<br>
<br>
    “Judge Vickers Cunningham possessed anti-semitic prejudice against Halprin which violated Halprin’s constitutional right to a trial in a fair tribunal equal protection, and free exercise of religion,” Mays wrote in her decision.<br>
<br>
    Halprin was serving a 30-year sentence for harming a child when he and six other inmates attempted to escape from prison. A police officer was killed during the attempt, and each member of the group, which came to be known as the “Texas 7,” was sentenced to death. Halprin claimed in his trial that he never fired his gun.<br>
<br>
    The judge who presided over the original case, Vickers “Vic” Cunningham, has been accused of using several antisemitic and racist slurs and, according to the Dallas Morning News, set up a trust fund for his children on the condition that they marry white Christians of the opposite sex. Court documents quoted a childhood friend of Cunningham’s who said the judge “took special pride” in sentencing the Texas 7 to death “because they included Latinos and Jews.”<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFFBF">Several Jewish groups got involved in Halprin’s case in recent years as he sought a new trial. The American Jewish Committee, Central Conference of American Rabbis, Men of Reform Judaism and Union for Reform Judaism were among those filing a joint amicus brief in support of Halprin’s 2019 appeal, and more than 100 Jewish lawyers in Texas signed on. The brief made the case that the appeal was not about Halprin’s guilt, but about Cunningham’s antisemitism.</span><br>
<br>
    “[T]hose issues are irrelevant, because questions of guilt and punishment follow a fair trial; they do not precede it,” it said. “And if Judge Cunningham is the bigot described in the application, a fair trial has not yet happened.”<br>
<br>
This is a textbook example of how Jews have perverted the American justice system — a cop killer and psychotic child abuser could escape the death penalty because the judge allegedly called him a name that he found “offensive.”<br>
<br>
Is it fair to ask whether or not Halprin’s “Jewishness” has anything to do with his abuse of a child?<br>
<br>
This case is yet another example of how when Jews attempt to combat “antisemitism,” they always seem to manage to create even more antisemitism.<br>
<br>
Prior to his participation in the murder of a police officer during his escape, Halprin was in prison serving a 30-year sentence for the psychopathic abuse of a 16-month-old infant, breaking his arms and legs, fracturing his skull and beating his face until one eye filled with blood — he must have thought the baby called him a “kike” — or burbled something that sounded like “kike.”<br>
<br>
We have to wonder how many times during his incarceration other prisoners have called Halprin a “kike” — or “Jew boy” — or any other racial term of endearment.<br>
<br>
But does referring to Halprin as a “f***ing Jew” in any way impinge on his ability to freely practice his religion? — After all, the foundation of Judaism — and secular Jewish identity — is that all Jews — from cradle to the grave — believe that they are hated by all non-Jews For No Reason Whatsoever™.<br>
<br>
Antisemitism™ is a “law of nature” — without which Jews would have no identity — an identity that is so nebulous and fragile that Jews actually fear they would lose their sense of “peoplehood” without the constant threat of antisemitism™.<br>
<br>
The Jewish “holy” book — the Talmud — is clear on this point — when a Jew kills a “goy,” no crime has been committed:<br>
<br>
    Sanhedrin 57a . When a Jew murders a gentile (“Cuthean”), there will be no death penalty.<br>
<br>
And the Talmud exonerates Halprin against the charges that he abused a child prior to the commission of the murder:<br>
<br>
    Yebamoth 98a. All gentile children are animals.<br>
<br>
From the perspective of Jewish law, Halprin’s only “crime” is that he brought unfavorable attention on his fellow Jews:<br>
<br>
    Moed Kattan 17a: If a Jew is tempted to do evil he should go to a city where he is not known and do the evil there.<br>
<br>
Three of the original Texas 7 were White men — would their death sentences have been commuted if Judge Cunningham had made disparaging remarks about them being “Godless white trash”? Need we ask?<br>
<br>
Besides Halprin, only Patrick Henry Murphy — one of the three White men — remains alive, having received a last minute stay of execution because he was denied the “right” to have a Buddhist priest praying with him as he is given a lethal injection — leading him into the “afterlife.”<br>
<br>
Would Murphy insist on his “right” to have his priest by his side if he were to be executed in a gas chamber?<br>
<br>
Only a learned rabbi could sort out that legal conundrum.<br>
