			<div class="content">Andrew Picard/Boeckman and the VIP paedophile connection<br>
thecolemanexperience.wordpress - <a href="https://archive.is/1OfnZ" class="postlink">https://archive.is/1OfnZ</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Despite being found guilty of producing and downloading 2,000 paedophile images he was allowed to walk free by sicko judge, Peter Ross, because he’d been ‘working through his issues’ with doctors.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In yet another vile travesty of justice Andrew Boeckman was allowed to use his mother’s maiden name of Picard during his trial and the subsequent reporting.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>You see, Andrew Boeckman is the son of wealthy American lawyer, Philip J Boeckman and his wife Erin (nee Picard), who split their time between the USA and Westminster.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The media would have us believe that Andrew Boeckman was working alone when he asked young boys to rape each other and filmed a two-year old girl being raped by a dog.
</div></blockquote>

It appears that he may have changed his name. Not sure, though.<br>
I did a DDG search, and first article was from 7/4/2021 - <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Andrew+Boeckman&amp;t=ffab&amp;df=y&amp;ia=web" class="postlink">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Andrew+Boeckm ... f=y&amp;ia=web</a> - <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/09hl1l.png" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/09hl1l.png</a> - <a href="https://archive.is/opucq" class="postlink">https://archive.is/opucq</a><br>
I couldn't retrieve or archive the article - <a href="https://www.best-msg.com/article/2021/07/04/207988.html" class="postlink">https://www.best-msg.com/article/2021/07/04/207988.html</a><br>
<br>
The quote from the article that appears in the DDG description reads:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Andrew pickup DE berkman (Andrew Picard Boeckman) is Cravath, Swaine&amp;Moore law firm partner, the son of a law firm enjoys a high reputation/elite, whose clients include jpmorgan chase (JP Morgan), Goldman Sachs (Goldman Sachs), etc.In order to make the berkman this name not to be noticed by the public (Andrew berkman, used in the court ...</div></blockquote>

So now is it Andrew Picard-Boeckman-Berkman?<br>
He's still nothing but an unpunished, non-cooperative, POS child pornagrapher.</div>

Rising Ground CEO Discusses Big Child Welfare Merger in New York City Foster Care <a href="https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2/interview-ceo-one-new-york-citys-largest-foster-care-agencies/32318" class="postlink">https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2 ... cies/32318</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2018<br>
<br>
Two of the larger foster care agencies in New York City announced a merger this summer, in another example of the New York City child welfare industry’s increasing consolidation in response to the plummeting number of city youth in foster care.<br>
<br>
The nonprofit Edwin Gould Services for Children and Families will become a subsidiary of Rising Ground, which recently changed its name from <span style="color:#FF0040">Leake and Watts</span>. Together, they will comprise a $130 million, 1,800-employee organization serving tens of thousands of New Yorkers, including nearly 2,000 kids whom either have been removed from their homes by the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) and placed in foster care due to neglect or abuse allegations, or are at risk of being removed.<br>
<br>
It’s high-stakes work that occasionally brings intense scrutiny. National media inundated Rising Ground after noticing that the organization was caring for some of the migrant youth who were separated from their parents under the Trump administration’s short-lived “zero tolerance” border policy. But, according to Alan Mucatel, Rising Ground CEO, the attention did little to slow down a merger process that began in earnest around a year ago.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the city foster care system is moving toward a major pivot point: Many of the hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with nonprofit service providers will be up for rebidding starting in the middle of 2019...</div></blockquote>

Leake and Watts Services <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leake_and_Watts_Services" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leake_and_Watts_Services</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Leake and Watts Services, Inc. is a not-for-profit social services agency in New York City that provides services for children and families in the areas of foster care, adoption, special education, Head Start and other related subjects.[1] It has facilities in Yonkers in Westchester County, New York, and in the Bronx and upper Manhattan in New York City. The agency began as the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum in Manhattan..<br>
<br>
History<br>
John George Leake (1752–1827) was a New York lawyer who had no children or siblings.[3] He died on June 2, 1827 at his home on Park Row in Manhattan. His estate, which included personal property valued at about $300,000 and real estate worth an additional $86,000,[5] he left to Robert Watts, the son of his best friend John Watts, with the stipulation that Robert Watts change his name to "Robert Leake."[6] Watts made the change, but died a few months later, leaving no will. The Leake fortune would then have passed to his father, John Watts, but considering the circumstances Watts was uncomfortable with receiving the money...<br>
<br>
Originally located at Trinity Church,[2] a new building for the orphanage at West 112th Street in <span style="color:#FF0040">Morningside Heights</span>, Manhattan, was completed in 1843, designed by Ithiel Town and constructed by Samuel Thomson in the Greek revival style.[3][4] The site of the orphanage was purchased in 1891 by Bishop Henry Codman Potter for the <span style="color:#FF0040">Cathedral of St. John the Divine</span>,[7] and the building was to be torn down. However, the building was preserved as part of the cathedral close, renovated in 2006, and is the oldest building still standing in Morningside Heights.[6]<br>
<br>
The Leake &amp; Watts Board of Trustees purchased a 30-acre in Yonkers, New York, in 1888.[8] In 1990, the orphanage opened in Yonkers.[9]<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">In 2012, a 16-year-old student named Corey Foster died at Leake and Watts while being restrained by the institution's staff </span>after refusing to leave the basketball court. The institute's practices, which include solitary confinement and punitive restraints, have been criticized.[10] However, the Westchester County District Attorney led a three-month investigation into the incidence and concluded that no criminal charges were warranted.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Doing some digging on Dr. Henry Jarecki after I saw his name on the Epstein flight logs, and he sounds like a freaking Bond villain. He is a is a German-born American academic, psychiatrist, entrepreneur, producer, philanthropist and one of the world's richest men...<br>
<br>
More recently, he has helped the City of Heidelberg, Germany to develop a campus in Bahnstadt for young research-based companies, and has established PsychoGenics, a psycho- and neuro-pharmaceutical contract research and drug discovery company in Paramus, New Jersey...<br>
<br>
In 2004, he co-founded the Gloria and Henry Jarecki School in Ratanakiri, Cambodia.<br>
<br>
He presently serves as a Governor of H. Lavity Stoutt Community College in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, as a trustee of the Island Resources Foundation, and founded the British Virgin Islands' first youth center, the Youth Empowerment Project, in <span style="color:#FF0040">Tortola</span>.,,<br>
<br>
So I tried a search combination of Jarecki and Epstein. I came across a PDF from the Institute of International Education celebrating the 10th anniversary of their Scholar Rescue Fund.<br>
<br>
Henry Jarecki is the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Institute of International Education. The IIE's Scholar Rescue Fund was established in 2002 by none other than Henry Jarecki.<br>
