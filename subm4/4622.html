<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">CLEVELAND — We know that “vaccines” are the leading cause of coincidences. But the injections are also related to a lot of karma in 2021.</span><br>
<br>
We wrote a story in July about Ohio judges mandating mRNA and viral vector DNA injections as a condition of probation at sentencing for criminal defendants. Franklin County (Columbus) judge David Matia sentenced at least three people to injections at the time of publishing. Said county issued a vaccine mandate that went into effect last week. All 1,400 Franklin County employees were required to show proof of Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson injection last week, or be fired.<br>
<br>
But the instant story is in Cuyahoga County (Cleveland). Two judges – Peter Corrigan and David Matia – were featured in our July story for sentencing people to mRNA and viral vector DNA injections. Cuyahoga County also has a vaccine mandate that required all employees to receive the injections by October 15. And whether it’s karma or coincidence, the story picks up from there.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://thecovidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Judge-Nancy-McDonnell-714x1024.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><em class="text-italics">Nancy McDonnell – Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge died September 28</em></span><br>
<br>
McDonnell has been on the Common Pleas Court in come capacity since 1997. Cleveland.com called her a “trailblazer” because she was the first female presiding and administrative judge on the court from 2006 to 2009. She died on Tuesday, September 28, at age 62.<br>
<br>
Local media appear to be pinning the death on McDonnell’s 2009 double lung transplant. This premise does have some merit. National Health Services (NHS) in the U.K. estimates that about half of lung transplant recipients live up to five years after the procedure. “Many” live at least 10 years, with a few reports of recipients living for 20-plus years, according to NHS.<br>
<br>
McDonnell was in year 12 post-transplant. Yet she likely chose to receive experimental mRNA or viral vector DNA injections to keep her job. It’s unclear if a doctor actually recommended the injections knowing her health history. McDonnell was a state employee for well over 30 years and likely had some sort of pension. Further, she also could have retired and received Social Security benefits. But again, her death and the vaxx mandate could just be a coincidence.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><em class="text-italics">Joseph Russo – Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge died October 2</em></span><br>
<br>
Joseph Russo had been a Cuyahoga County judge since 2001. Note, Ohio judges are nominated by political parties, but said party does not appear on the ballot when people vote for them. He made a run at the state Supreme Court in 2008, but lost the election. Russo died on Saturday, October 2 at age 59.<br>
<br>
Two mainstream media outlets reported that Russo “died unexpectedly.” As we’ve seen throughout 2021, “died unexpectedly” and “short illness” are two common mainstream media terms when vaxxed people die. Russo is survived by his wife of 28 years and two children.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/SySvekygEhb7eyQ0uE3NprQhA9Y=/700x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/OBNCZEQ6KRDHXC4XIN2GO7TH5Q.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><em class="text-italics">Larry Jones – 8th District Court of Appeals died October 7</em></span><br>
<br>
Larry Jones worked as a Cleveland-area judge in some capacity for 34 years. He was a Cuyahoga County prosecutor for three years (1978 to 1981) before being elected to Cleveland City Council. Jones was a judge in the Cleveland Municipal Court from 1988 to 2009 before his elevation to the appellate court.<br>
<br>
Once again, two mainstream media outlets reported that Jones “died unexpectedly” in Tampa, Florida on Thursday, October 7. He was 68 years old. Jones is survived by his wife, two children and one grandchild.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Power grab?</span><br>
<br>
It’d be remiss and even negligent from a journalistic perspective not to point out the fact that all three of the deceased judges were Democrats. The Ohio Supreme Court appoints interim judges to handle the deceased judges’ dockets. But Ohio Republican Governor Mike DeWine will eventually appoint permanent replacements for all of them. All said replacements will no doubt be Republicans. However, DeWine is also the pioneer of vaxx lotteries. He was the first to offer vaxxed people a chance to win $1 million if they get their shots. Several states followed suit thereafter.<br>
<br>
Never wish death upon people. That leads to negative karma. But what also leads to bad karma is a state court sentencing people to de-facto death and maiming by forcing mRNA and viral vector DNA injections. Coincidences are one thing. But this story, again, is a glaring example of both coincidence and karma. Perhaps Ohio judges will re-think their sentencing guidelines after witnessing these deaths.<br>
<br>
We tried contacting Mr. Cameron Stringer, who was sentenced to the vaxx by a Franklin County, Ohio judge. He has not responded as of publishing. But we’ll update if we hear from him. Stay vigilant and protect your friends and loved ones.</div></blockquote></div>
