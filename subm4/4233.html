			<div class="content">Sect Members Were Fulfilling Right To Support ‘Good President,’ Leader Says<br>
Sun., Dec. 22, 1996 <a href="https://archive.vn/G3CmY#selection-1103.0-1107.19" class="postlink">https://archive.vn/G3CmY#selection-1103.0-1107.19</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Minh Nguyen says it would be impossible to find a group of people less politically minded than his fellow disciples of Supreme Master Suma Ching Hai.<br>
The follower who dares to introduce politics to a meditation gathering at Ching Hai’s center here is swiftly shown the door, Nguyen said.<br>
Yet members, who sometimes meditate for nine hours a day in this manicured patch of ranch country two hours southeast of Los Angeles, have been thrust from obscurity into the national limelight.<br>
The fund created to pay President Clinton’s legal bills from the Whitewater case and other matters disclosed last week that it had returned $640,000 to donors, many of whom belonged to the sect.<br>
<br>
Nguyen’s personal check for $1,000 has not been returned. He said he made the donation to the fund earlier this year after members learned through electronic mail, TV and newspaper reports, and “maybe talk between us,” that they could help defray Clinton’s mounting legal bills.<br>
“He is a good person, a spiritual person,” Nguyen said of Clinton.<br>
Standing on the outskirts of Ching Hai’s compound in the rugged Riverside County hills, Nguyen said the entire affair was “only a mistake.”<br>
“This is a spiritual place,” the Vietnamese native said. “It doesn’t matter what happened outside. We just enjoy the spiritual life here.”<br>
<br>
But investigators working for the fund reportedly suspected many contributions were bogus because the donors appeared unable to afford $1,000 gifts. Some signatures on the donation checks had identical handwriting, and some of the donations were in sequentially numbered money orders from people in different cities, the fund’s lawyer has said.<br>
In March, fund-raiser and Clinton friend <span style="color:#FF0040">Charles Yah Lin Trie</span> delivered $460,000 to the Presidential Legal Expense Trust. He later provided more money, but the fund returned all of it - a total of $640,000.<br>
<br>
Fund administrators feared that Trie was using Ching Hai members as a front to conceal the true source of the donations, or to violate contribution limits set by the fund. But Trie’s link to the group is unclear and no larger scheme has been uncovered.<br>
On Thursday, the Justice Department issued subpoenas both to the White House counsel’s office and the trust seeking records related to the return of the donations.<br>
<br>
Nguyen, 34, a U.S. citizen who owns a vegetarian food manufacturing firm, said he was not reimbursed by anyone and that no one was pressured to donate. His own wife, a fellow disciple and a Republican, did not contribute.<br>
And while some sect members borrowed the money from friends, he did not.<br>
“People, from my point of view, they appreciate the government to give them freedom to come to the U.S.A. and start a new life,” he said of the many Asian immigrant members.<br>
“Because we are Americans, we need to fulfill our rights to support a good president,” he said. “After four years he did good work. He helped a lot of people in and outside the U.S.A.”<br>
<br>
...<span style="text-decoration:underline"> THE PLAYERS</span> Intriguing new characters seem to emerge daily in the controversy over foreign-linked campaign donations to President Clinton and the Democrats. A current sampling: Charles Yah Lin Trie: A longtime Arkansas friend of Clinton, who used to dine at Trie’s Little Rock restaurant, the international consultant and member of a presidential trade commission delivered $640,000 in questionable donations to the Clintons’ Whitewater legal defense fund last spring. They were later returned. Wang Jun: A Chinese government weapons dealer who attended a White House reception held by Clinton last February. Trie arranged the invitation. The president has said it was inappropriate for Wang, whose company later was implicated in arms smuggling into the United States, to attend. Mochtar and James Riady: The patriarch and his son, respectively, of Indonesia’s Lippo Group conglomerate. Family members and Lippo associates have contributed heavily to Clinton and the Democrats over the years. James Riady made numerous visits to the White House, including six in which he met with the president. John Huang: Chief of Lippo’s U.S. operations before his appointment to a senior Commerce Department position and later transfer to the Democratic National Committee as a fund-raiser. He raised an estimated $3.4 million this election year, much of which was returned because of questions about its origins. Justice Department: Has expanded its investigation of fund-raising irregularities by the Democratic Party to include the president and first lady’s legal defense fund. Buddhist sects: Leading sources of the questionable Democratic donations. Vice President Al Gore attended a controversial fund-raiser with Asian-Americans in April at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif. Suma Ching Hai, leader of an international sect based in Taiwan, sometimes auctions her personal relics - including a pair of sweat socks that reportedly sold for $800. <span style="color:#FF0040">Mark Middleton: An international businessman and former White House aide who solicited funds in Asia for a foundation refurbishing Clinton’s childhood home in Hope, Ark., to make it into a tourist attraction</span>. - Associated Press</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Charlie Trie's contributions to the Presidential Legal <br>
Expense Trust (the ``Trust'') further illustrate the manner in <br>
which Trie raised foreign money, as well as his close ties to <br>
the White House and the President. Unlike contributions to the <br>
Clinton/Gore campaign or the DNC, contributions to the Trust <br>
inured directly to the personal financial benefit of President <br>
Clinton and the First Lady. The money was used to pay their <br>
personal legal bills. Because such contributions are even more <br>
susceptible to abuse than ordinary campaign contributions, the <br>
Committee looked closely at Trie's activities with respect to <br>
the Trust and the White House's knowledge of and response to <br>
those activities.<br>
<br>
In March 1996, Trie personally delivered almost one half <br>
million dollars in checks and money orders to the Trust. Trust <br>
representatives and White House officials recognized almost <br>
immediately that the donations were highly questionable and <br>
appeared, at least in part, to have been coerced from members <br>
of a <span style="color:#FF0040">controversial Buddhist sect.</span> However, rather than simply <br>
returning the suspect donations and publicly reporting such <br>
returns--which had been the Trust's historical practice--the <br>
Trust, in consultation with senior White House officials, hid <br>
the returned donations by changing the format of the Trust's <br>
bi-annual public disclosure form. This avoided public <br>
disclosure of any information concerning the Trie donations <br>
prior to the 1996 presidential election.<br>
<br>
Moreover, when the Trust finally sent the donations back to <br>
the Trie-related contributors, it did so with a twist. It <br>
invited these contributors to recontribute their money, <br>
notwithstanding the fact that they knew a substantial amount of <br>
the money had been coerced from these very donors in the first <br>
place. Not surprisingly, once Charlie Trie's close association <br>
with James Riady, John Huang and the entire DNC fundraising <br>
matter became public through press reports in October 1996, the <br>
Trust and White House senior officials quickly determined that <br>
the ``recontributions'' should also be returned--this time with <br>
no strings attached. However, neither the White House nor the <br>
Trust publicly disclosed the Trie/Trust connection or the <br>
strange origin of the donations until after the election and <br>
even then only because they were forced to do so by a <br>
threatened press story....<br>
<br>
. The Rose of the Ching Hai Buddhist Sect<br>
<br>
    During its investigation, IGI conducted extensive computer <br>
information searches, interviewed numerous donors <br>
telephonically, and contacted several experts on cults and <br>
religious sects. Based on these efforts, IGI determined that <br>
Trie likely laundered some or all of the funds through members <br>
of the Ching Hai Buddhist sect to the Trust and that many sect <br>
members were, in fact, coerced into making the donations.<br>
    The Ching Hai Buddhist organization is headed by the <br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Supreme Master Suma Ching Hai</span>. According to IGI's findings and <br>
other published information, the Supreme Master studied <br>
Buddhism in <span style="color:#FF0040">Taiwan, where she maintains her headquarters</span>. Aside <br>
from leading the sect, she also designs her own line of clothes <br>
and conducts fashion shows.\51\ She encourages her followers to <br>
make donations to and purchase items from Ching Hai. <br>
Notwithstanding her teachings to her followers to focus on the <br>
spiritual and not the material, IGI found that Suma Ching Hai <br>
generally travels and lives in an opulent style. Indeed, IGI <br>
reported that <span style="color:#FF0040">she is considered a fraud by many other Buddhist <br>
groups.</span>\52\ IGI also reported on certain unconventional <br>
practices within the sect, such as the sale of the Supreme <br>
Master's bathwater to her followers (which she apparently <br>
claims has curative properties).\53\<br>
<br>
As a result of its interviews with experts who had studied <br>
the Ching Hai sect extensively, IGI learned that its <br>
membersoften donate sums to the organization greater than they can <br>
afford.54 IGI concluded that it was highly likely that the <br>
funds donated by members of Ching Hai to the Trust were not given <br>
voluntarily.<br>
<br>
IGI also discovered that the donors to the Trust were <br>
solicited by the Supreme Master at large meetings in Los <br>
Angeles, Houston and New York. Many of the members IGI <br>
interviewed said they did not have check books or sufficient <br>
funds with them at the meetings, so in some cases fellow <br>
members wrote checks on their behalf, and in other cases money <br>
orders were provided and people simply filled them out with <br>
their addresses and social security numbers.<br>
<br>
For obvious reasons, the Committee looked closely at <br>
whether the Ching Hai members reimbursed the sect for the money <br>
orders they had filled out or whether the sect simply funneled <br>
its funds through its members to Trie and ultimately the Trust. <br>
The organizer of the Ching Hai meeting in New York, Zhi Hua <br>
Dong, addressed this issue when he testified before the <br>
Committee on July 31, 1997.<br>
<br>
C. Testimony of Zhi Hua Dong<br>
<br>
    <span style="color:#FF0040">Zhi Hua Dong is a computer systems administrator in the <br>
physics department at Columbia University. He served as the New <br>
York contact member for Ching Hai</span> and was one of the organizers <br>
of a March 16, 1996 meeting of the group in New York. Dong <br>
testified before the Committee and explained how the donations <br>
were gathered at that meeting. A couple of days prior to March <br>
16, Dong was contacted by one of the Supreme Master's <br>
assistants and told to purchase $20,000 in money orders and was <br>
assured that he would be reimbursed for the purchase. He was <br>
not told why the money was needed. Later the same day he <br>
received another call from the same individual and was told to <br>
purchase as many money orders as he could. After contacting a <br>
few other members from the New York area, Dong was able to <br>
purchase $70,000 in money orders.<br>
<br>
Dong testified that he and his wife met the Supreme Master <br>
Suma Ching Hai at Kennedy International Airport along with <br>
other sect members.58 Dong's wife, Tracy Hui, drove <br>
Charlie Trie and the Supreme Master into Manhattan. Dong <br>
followed in another vehicle. Upon arriving at the Ritz Carlton <br>
Hotel in midtown, Dong went up to the Supreme Master's room <br>
where he delivered the money orders he had been asked to <br>
purchase. At that time the Supreme Master explained to him that <br>
they were helping President Clinton raise funds for his <br>
personal legal expenses. Trie, who was to be initiated into the <br>
sect at the meeting, was also in the room and wrote down the <br>
full name of the Trust so that people would be able to spell it <br>
correctly on their money orders and checks. Before leaving, <br>
Dong observed the Master removing $20,000-25,000 from the stack <br>
of money orders for sect-related expenses.<br>
<br>
During the meeting that night, which was held at the Inn at <br>
57th Street, the Supreme Master addressed about 150 new <br>
initiates, all U.S. citizens, and told them that President <br>
Clinton was a good person and needed their help. After <br>
requesting them to contribute to the Trust, the Master turned <br>
to leave the room and to go downstairs to a private meeting. <br>
When some of the new initiates tried to follow her, she turned <br>
and in an angry tone told them to stay put and attend to <br>
business.60 When one of the followers tried to ask a <br>
``spiritual question,'' she angrily told him that it was not <br>
the time for spiritual questions.61 According to <br>
Dong, her tone made some of the members uncomfortable,<br>
<br>
The voice was very strong, very strong, you know, <br>
        from my perspective, I feel some energy coming out, and <br>
        her tone, you know, could make people uncomfortable . . <br>
        . there is one person stand up, after Master talked, <br>
        stand up, asked a spiritual question regarding the <br>
        practice. Master was very angry . . . It's a very <br>
        strong voice. That could irritate people.<br>
<br>
Immediately following the event, Dong went back to the <br>
Master's room at the Ritz-Carlton and helped count the funds <br>
that had been raised. Between sixty and one hundred of the <br>
blank money orders had been filled out by individuals who did <br>
not pay for them.63 The Master added a number of <br>
checks and money orders from another meeting, and, according to <br>
Dong, the total amount finally given to Trie could have been <br>
more than $400,000. ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    Dong had never met Trie prior to the New York meeting, and <br>
he testified that from the way Trie talked, he was under the <br>
impression that he worked directly for President <br>
Clinton.65 This was the only time Dong was aware of <br>
the Supreme Master ever asking for support for a political <br>
figure.66 Four days after this New York meeting--on <br>
March 20--Trie called Cardozo to set up their initial <br>
meeting.<br>
<br>
Dong testified that in May, 1996, Trie called him and asked <br>
him if they could meet at the airport while Trie was changing <br>
planes in New York. At this meeting Trie was very upset because <br>
the Trust was investigating the source of the contributions. He <br>
told Dong that the Trust was being ``very cautious'' because it <br>
was ``an election year.''<br>
<br>
Several weeks after the event, Dong contacted the Ching Hai <br>
headquarters in Taiwan requesting that he and his fellow <br>
membersbe reimbursed for the $70,000 in money orders that they <br>
had purchased with their own money. Dong testified that up to this <br>
point he had received little or no reimbursement from the individual <br>
members. Dong and the other members who had advanced funds for the <br>
money orders were eventually reimbursed by the sect in three wire <br>
transfers, one for $20,000 from Taiwan, one for $30,000 from Cambodia <br>
where the sect had a chapter, and the balance in a wire transfer from <br>
Los Angeles chapter.<br>
<br>
VI. May 9, 1996 White House Meeting<br>
<br>
    After receiving the initial investigative report from IGI, <br>
including information about the Ching Hai Buddhist group, <br>
Cardozo scheduled another meeting at the White House for May 9, <br>
1996 to again discuss the Trie donations.70 <span style="color:#FF0040">The <br>
meeting was attended by Cardozo, Schwartz and Libow on behalf <br>
of the Trust, and Harold Ickes, Jack Quinn, White House <br>
Counsel, Bruce Lindsey, Deputy White House Counsel, Cheryl <br>
Mills, Deputy White House Counsel, Evelyn Lieberman, Deputy <br>
Chief of Staff, and Maggie Williams, Chief of staff to the <br>
First Lady, on behalf of the White House</span>. Cardozo did not know <br>
why it was necessary to meet with so many senior members of the <br>
White House staff, especially in light of his insistence that <br>
the Trust operated independent of the White House.71 <br>
The White House apparently made the decision as to which staff <br>
members would attend.<br>
<br>
On April 24, 1996, Trie visited the Trust for the second time. <br>
He met with Cardozo and Schwartz and brought a shopping bag with him. <br>
Cardozo testified that when he saw Trie approach he thought to himself <br>
``Oh my God, he's got a million dollars.'' In fact, Trie had an <br>
additional $179,000 for the Trust. Because the Trust was investigating <br>
the first batch of donations, Cardozo refused to accept the donations. <br>
Because IGI had been specifically instructed by Cardozo not to <br>
interview Trie, they had instead prepared a list of questions to be <br>
asked of Trie at the April 24 meeting in order to gain a better <br>
understanding of the source of the donations. However, neither Cardozo <br>
nor Schwartz asked any of IGI's questions at the meeting. <br>
<br>
During the May 9 meeting, Cardozo explained the key facts <br>
surrounding Trie's donations to the Trust, and called upon <br>
Libow, the Trust's attorney, to provide the group with a <br>
summary of IGI's findings regarding Ching Hai and its leader, <br>
Suma Ching Hai. Libow described IGI's findings in great detail <br>
including their conclusion that at least some of the donations <br>
may have been coerced.<br>
<br>
IGI's conclusion was ultimately proven <br>
correct when in July Cardozo received a letter from Ching Hai member <br>
David Lawrence. Cardozo circulated the letter to all of the people who <br>
had attended the May 9 meeting, as well as Mrs. Clinton. The Lawrence <br>
letter confirmed that in fact many of the donors did not contribute <br>
their own funds:<br>
<br>
Unfortunately as you suspected, the funds were raised by <br>
      the efforts of a concerned party who was unaware of some of <br>
      the terms mentioned in your letter. In particular, none of <br>
      those in the private association involved in the fund <br>
      raising knew that the individual U.S. citizen donors were <br>
      required to use only their own funds. In my case, $500 <br>
      given by money order was advanced by the association or its <br>
      leader and not reimbursed by me. We were led to believe <br>
      that reimbursement was optional. I am sure that none of the <br>
      members or leadership of the association knew otherwise. In <br>
      addition, I was not made aware of the other terms mentioned <br>
      periodic public reports of fund contributors.''<br>
      <br>
<br>
 Mr. Ickes was not alone in his failure to follow up on <br>
Trie's actions with regard to the Trust. White House personnel, <br>
including the President, not only failed to notify the DNC of <br>
Trie's questionable fundraising practices with the Trust, but <br>
continued to have contact with him. Only four days after the <br>
May 9 White House meeting, the President sat next to Trie at <br>
the head table of a $5,000 per person dinner in <br>
Washington.82 In August, 1996, two months after the <br>
Trust decided to return the Trie-related donations, the <br>
President accepted $110,000 from Trie at an event celebrating <br>
the President's 50th birthday.83 In addition, as <br>
noted above, the President proceeded to appoint Trie to a <br>
federal trade commission and had the NSC prepare a personal <br>
response to foreign policy questions raised by Trie, both after <br>
Cardozo informed the White House and the First Lady about the <br>
questionable Trust donations.<br>
<br>
n May 17, 1996, Trie visited the Trust for the third and <br>
final time. Cardozo asked Schwartz to meet with Trie alone <br>
because Cardozo no longer wished to have any dealings with <br>
him.84 During the meeting, Trie acknowledged that he <br>
was indeed a member of the Ching Hai sect and that he had <br>
encouraged the Supreme Master to help him raise money for the <br>
Trust.85 Trie also had additional donations which he <br>
said totaled $150,000--bringing the total to $789,000--that he <br>
wished to deliver, but Schwartz refused to accept them because <br>
by the Trust had yet to make a determination regarding the <br>
first delivery of funds.....<br>
<br>
XIII. CONCLUSION<br>
<br>
    As a result of its investigation into Trie's activities <br>
with the Trust, the Committee gained further insight into <br>
Trie's close relationship with the White House, and how, as a <br>
major fundraiser, Trie raised and laundered contributions for <br>
the benefit of the President and First Lady. The evidence <br>
uncovered by the Trust's own investigators reveals that the <br>
donations were laundered through members of a controversial <br>
Buddhist sect, many of whom were coerced into making the <br>
donations. The evidence also reveals that senior members of the <br>
White House staff were informed of this disturbing fact, yet <br>
still acquiesced in a plan to have the donations returned to <br>
the contributors, and then resubmitted to the Trust. This plan <br>
soon became untenable because of Trie's sudden notoriety over <br>
his relationship with John Huang and the growing DNC <br>
fundraising controversy. Rather than publicly disclosing Trie's <br>
involvement with the Trust, however, the White House sought to <br>
keep the matter secret until after the presidential election. <br>
Moreover, despite all of the warning signs they were given, <br>
these same White House aides, particularly Harold Ickes and <br>
Bruce Lindsey, made no effort whatsoever to alert the DNC that <br>
a major DNC fundraiser was involved in money laundering with <br>
the Trust.<br>
<br>
 The investigation also demonstrated that Trie was granted <br>
several special favors by the White House at or about the same <br>
time that he was raising and delivering the questionable funds <br>
to the Trust. One question which remains unanswered is whether <br>
these favors--the appointment of Trie to the trade commission, <br>
Wang Jun's invitation to meet personally with the President, or <br>
the personal reply letter from the President prepared by the <br>
NSC explaining U.S. foreign policy--were linked in any way to <br>
the Trust donations. These same types of questions were raised <br>
<br>
by the Trustees in their initial meetings concerning Trie. <br>
Inexplicably, neither the Trust nor the White House ever made <br>
any attempt to investigate these matters. Because Trie had fled <br>
to China during the course of the Committee's investigation and <br>
did not return until early February 1998, and Mark Middleton <br>
has asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-<br>
incrimination, the Committee could not conclusively answer <br>
these questions.</div></blockquote></div>

<br>
Coffee's not coffee...coffee is sex. Bill Clinton met with a KINGPIN of international slave prostitution trade 10 times and accepted over $7 million from him! <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1666347" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1666347</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What originally got me looking into coffee as a codeword was the video of Norm Macdonald's roast at the 1997 Radio-Television Correspondents Association Dinner. If you haven't watched it yet, I would suggest watching it in full...it's awesome!

<br>
..What originally got me looking into coffee as a codeword was the video of Norm Macdonald's roast at the 1997 Radio-Television Correspondents Association Dinner. If you haven't watched it yet, I would suggest watching it in full...it's awesome! Here is the reference to a cup of coffee: <a href="https://youtu.be/d5kpXhq5nHM?t=8m3s" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/d5kpXhq5nHM?t=8m3s</a><br>
<br>
Now it took me a while to figure out what Norm was referring to with his $90,000 cup of coffee joke. I finally figured it out when I found this transcript from an SNL Weekend Update where he again references the cup of coffee, this time with some context.<br>
<br>
(Third paragraph down): <a href="http://archive.is/dZClE" class="postlink">http://archive.is/dZClE</a> Here it is in case you don't want to open and find it:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">[Photo of John Huang] Meanwhile, the Indogate scandal continues to widen. Internal Democratic National Committee records now show that fundraiser John Huang was responsible for bringing two Chinese businessmen to the White House for a $180,000 "coffee" with the President. That works out to $90,000 for a cup of coffee, although, in the President's defense, the coffee was Starbucks. ... [mild reaction from crowd so Norm explains] Starbucks is a little pricey.<br>
</em><br>
<br>
So the $90,000 coffee joke that Norm Macdonald roasted Bill Clinton with was about the 90's scandal dubbed Indogate or Chinagate or Libbogate. Basically a Chinese born DNC fundraiser was bringing Chinese elites into the white house to have "coffee" with Bill Clinton for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Here is the full story: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_campaign_finance_controversy" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Unit ... ontroversy</a><br>
<br>
John Huang - DNC fundraiser who organized coffee for Yah Lin Trie and the Bill Clinton. Visited white house at least 78 times.<br>
<br>
Yah Lin "Charlie" Trie - Little Rock entrepreneur who owned Chinese restaurant that the Clinton's frequented (what's up with billionaires owning pizza/chinese shops?). He is a big fundraiser who took arms dealers into the white house to meet with the president. His business partner was Ng Lap Seng (Mr. Wu) and $7 million was donated from Ng to the democratic party through "Charlie" Trie.<br>
<br>
Ng Lap Seng (Mr. Wu) - Property developer and businessman from Macau. Visited white houes 10 times between '94-'96 including one overnight stay with President Clinton. Owns Fortuna hotel in Macau which is a known brothel.  A couple quotes from articles on these guys:<br>
<br>
"Ng does not have a criminal record but is reported to be involved in a number of illicit activities. He is portrayed in some of the media as a “Macau Crime Lord” and, according the report, “a kingpin of the international slave prostitution trade”. It is reported that the Fortuna acts as a ‘hangout’ for the Shui Fong Triad – a group that is notorious for loan-sharking, protections rackets and prostitution in Macau." <a href="http://archive.is/txXlD#selection-819.1-808.11" class="postlink">http://archive.is/txXlD#selection-819.1-808.11</a><br>
<br>
He owns the "Fortuna Hotel in Macao, known as much for its prostitutes working the lobby as for its floor show of whip-wielding, leather-clad dancers upstairs."<br>
<br>
Did you catch that??? ** Bill Clinton had a kingpin of international slave trade visit the white house at least 10 times and accepted millions of dollars from him!** Here's the story from the Wall Street Journal that mentions the 10 visits: <a href="http://archive.is/qKsQ0" class="postlink">http://archive.is/qKsQ0</a><br>
<br>
Bill Clinton was known for his ability to raise money, and he wouldn't have been able to do it without the help of coffee. He came up with the bright idea to hold Coffee Klatch's where guests would pay tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to come have coffee with the president and often to spend the night. Here is a great article from the Washington Post with more details: <a href="http://archive.is/VvJ7O" class="postlink">http://archive.is/VvJ7O</a> <br>
<br>
..Just to make this even more pizzagate related, let's tie in the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation focuses a lot of their efforts on coffee.<br>
Here is what they are doing with Coffee in Haiti: <a href="http://archive.is/jj4uY" class="postlink">http://archive.is/jj4uY</a> Here is what they are doing with Coffee in Rwanda: <a href="http://archive.is/olGCE" class="postlink">http://archive.is/olGCE</a> They set up a coffee factory in Gikondo, Rwanda. Gikondo is a rural city where the government sends all of the street vagrants from the capital city in order to keep the capital city clean. These street vagrants include many children, pregnant women, and sex workers. <a href="http://archive.is/7zN2g" class="postlink">http://archive.is/7zN2g</a><br>
<br>
One last thing to think about...star-bucks (Jk but what a weird coincidence).<br>
<br>
PS. here's a great video of Norm Macdonald on the View saying that Bill Clinton murdered someone...just to add to his credability:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Chung provided numerous leads, including one that pertained to Mark Middleton. <br>
According to Chung he was to receive $300,000 from General Ji Shengde, Military Intelligence <br>
Director of the People’s Liberation Army. At their Hong Kong meeting. General Ji told Mr. <br>
Chung: “We really like your President. We hope he will be re-elected. I will give you $300,000 <br>
U.S. dollars. You can give it to your President and Democrat Party.” Chung expected the fiinds <br>
to come from Liu Chao Ying, a woman with whom he was going into business. Liu was the <br>
daughter of General Liu Hua Qing, who some have described as the most powerful military <br>
leader in China and also a technology expert. Chung later expressed some concern to Liu, who, <br>
in what Chung describes as tin effort to assuage his concerns, told him that Mark Middleton <br>
participated in a similar scheme. According to Liu, Middleton “got half a million” firom a <br>
Singapore group from someone named Hwang, Huang or Wong and the purpose of the money <br>
was ‘to do good things for China,’ or to benefit China. ..<br>
<br>
Middleton came to Washington in 1992 after raising money for the Clinton campaign. <br>
<br>
He was a young attorney who had left the law firm of Mitchell, Williams, Selig, Gates &amp; <br>
Woodyard, to become one of the first campaign workers for then-Govemor Clinton. Middleton <br>
raised between $4-5 million as Arkansas Director and later as Southern Finance Director. <br>
<br>
During the transition period after the 1992 election, Middleton worked for <span style="color:#FF0040">Mack McLarty</span>, who <br>
had just been named Chief of Staff. McLarty later hired Middleton as an executive or special <br>
assistant in the Chief of Staff’s Office, where he was a liaison to the Arkansas and business <br>
communities. ...<br>
<br>
The first documented contacts between Middleton, Huang and Riady occurred <br>
in June 1993. According to White House reeords, Huang, who was then living in Los Angeles <br>
and in charge of U.S. operations for the Lippo Group, visited Middleton at the White House on <br>
June 7, 1993. Shortly thereafter, James Riady met with Mark Middleton at the White House on <br>
June 28, 1993. By late March 1994 Huang and Middleton began a consistent pattern of monthly <br>
phone calls...<br>
<br>
1. The First Trip to Asia <br>
<br>
Middleton was scheduled to leave the White House on February 17, 1995. Middleton <br>
told Green that before he started at IRI, he wanted to take a vacation, move, buy a new car and <br>
settle some family business. He asked Green for a $25,000 advance on his yearly salary of <br>
$125,000, which he was given. As he assumed his new position at IRI, Middleton finalized his <br>
trip to Asia. He planned to go with Charlie Trie and his brother <span style="color:#FF0040">Larry Middleton</span>. Trie’s office <br>
manager, Maria Mapili, produced an itinerary for the trip. (Attachment 1 1) According to the <br>
itinerary, they planned to travel to the following cities and countries beginning on March 21, <br>
1995: Beijing, China; Hongzhou, China; Shanghai, China; Hong Kong; Macau; Kuangzhou, <br>
China; Nanhai, China; Taipei; Jakarta, Indonesia, and; Brunei. Larry Middleton testified in a <br>
deposition before the Committee that he did not accompany his brother on the entire trip, and did <br>
not know the countries Mark Middleton had visited before they met. (Attachment 12) <br>
<br>
Documents and testimony indicate that Trie and Middleton visited associates of Trie’s <br>
during the March/April trip to Asia. Trie was a Director of Consolidated Trust Company <br>
(“CTC”) in Hong Kong, owned by Ng Lap Seng’s business associate William Peh. Peh has <br>
asserted that he and Ng added Trie to Consolidated Trust’s leadership because, among other <br>
things, Trie’s U.S. ties were helpfiU to the company. On a CTC corporate fact sheet, Trie was <br>
listed as an “Advisor to President Clinton.” Trie was assisting Ng and Peh in finding investors <br>
for a real estate development project referred to as Nam Van Lakes, located in Macau. <br>
<br>
..One of the projects that Trie <br>
introduced him to was the Nam Van Lakes project. This project was co-owned by Ng Lap Seng, <br>
and Stanley and Edmund Ho. At the time, CTC was searching for funding on the project.<br>
<br>
..While in Asia, the Riady family hosted Middleton in Hong Kong and Jakarta. A faxed <br>
message from Middleton’s assistant notes, “Larry spoke with Johnny Huang who said that you <br>
need to get your itinerary to the Riady Group (sic). They want to take care of you while yop are <br>
in Hong Kong -* have a car meet you at the airport, etc. . (Attachment 1 8) Middleton wrote to <br>
Lippo Group executive Joe Hanna, “I am writing to find out the hotel arrangements you have <br>
made for me in Jakarta and if you have set up a meeting for me with Mr. Bakerie (sic).” <br>
(Attachment 19) Larry Middleton testified that James Riady hosted a diimer for the Middleton’s <br>
while they were in Jakarta as well... </div></blockquote>

Finally the circle is complete.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>My Opinion about our slow boat to China: After researching the banking families of <span style="color:#FF0040">Riady family and Lippo Group</span>, I believe they chose Carter to help weaken our country in regards to China. Clinton was a China puppet (as was Shrillary more recently), BC helped to strengthen China's foothold under most favored nation status. Bushes are complete dirty warmongering dogs, 9/11 was a pretense to attack Iraq imho, and under Bush China became member of WTO on 12/11/2001. Kind of fitting if you don't think it's a coincidence. Obama and Clinton (and traitor Gore) helped brought about (with outside help), <span style="color:#FF0040">the Climate Change scam in which China gets to skate</span>, and world is under the constant threat of extortion.

In 1994, the US governors of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin each awarded Supreme Master Ching Hai with certificates bearing the state seal for her aid to flood-affected Americans. During a ceremony, the governors proclaimed February 22 Supreme Master Ching Hai Day, as congratulatory messages arrived from US Presidents <span style="color:#FF0040">Jimmy Carter,</span> George Bush and Bill Clinton.<br>
<br>
Over the years, Supreme Master Ching Hai has contributed more than US$30 million in timely assistance to many causes, not including donations that were made anonymously. From Darfur to Haiti to Sri Lanka and Japan, those affected by natural disasters, refugees, war veterans, the elderly, the homeless, and those with serious illnesses have been some of the recipients of her loving concern.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, benefit concerts were held in Washington, DC and Los Angeles in Supreme Master Ching Hai’s honor. During these events, Supreme Master Ching Hai presented hundreds of thousands of dollars to US Veterans Affairs, <span style="color:#FF0040">Starlight Children’s Foundation</span> and other American organizations. At the 2011 world premiere of the musical, The Real Love, in Pasadena, Supreme Master Ching Hai also gave donations to six US charitable groups, including <span style="color:#FF0040">Childhelp, Greenpeace and United Way of Greater Los Angeles</span>.<br>
<br>
At the 2012 world premiere of Loving the Silent Tears, three charitable organizations, Broadway Cares / Equity Fights AIDS, Animal Defenders International, and Worldwide Veterinary Service, accepted Supreme Master Ching Hai’s contributions totaling US$300,000. The gifts, which were presented by government officials, were made on behalf of all the musical artists and to honor the organizations for their noble work.<br>

“Supreme Master Ching Hai is obviously a Supreme Master in terms of really being focused and dedicated to studying what is the essence of life and how it should be shared. Wherever she goes it’s ‘love one another and love humanity, love the creatures….’”</em></div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1997<br>
 <br>
Washington - Three Buddhist nuns told a Senate committee yesterday that the US Vice-President, Mr Al Gore, was accompanied by two Democratic Party money-raisers when he visited their temple for an apparently illegal campaign lunch last year.<br>
<br>
Testifying to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Man Ho, Man Ya and Yi Chu of the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California, described Mr Gore's visit which generated $100,000 for the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The hearing represented a clear political danger for Mr Gore's presidential hopes, especially coming a day after the Justice Department opened a 30-day review into his fund-raising activities from the White House. Man Ho said DNC fund-raiser, Mr John Huang, served as master of ceremonies and his associate, Ms Maria Hsia, was Mr Gore's interpreter for his visit on April 29th, 1996. Both were deeply involved in raising money from the Asian American community for the Democratic Party.<br>
<br>
Ms Man Ho said she approached Ms Yi Chu who found 11 monks and nuns and asked them each to write $5,000 for the DNC, even though several did not have that much money in their personal accounts. Each was then immediately reimbursed from temple funds. Such activity would appear to violate a law which prohibits individuals from making political contributions with money that is not their own.

Hsi Lai Temple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsi_Lai_Temple" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsi_Lai_Temple</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Fo Guang Shan Hsi Lai Temple (Chinese: 佛光山西來寺; pinyin: Fóguāngshān Xīlái Sì) is a mountain monastery in the northern Puente Hills, Hacienda Heights, Los Angeles County, California. The name Hsi Lai means "coming west".<br>
<br>
Hsi Lai Temple is a branch of Fo Guang Shan, a Buddhist organization from Taiwan. It is the order's first overseas branch temple and serves as the North American regional headquarters for Fo Guang Shan. Hsi Lai Temple was the site of the founding of Buddha's Light International Association, established in 1991. The temple, like its mother temple in Taiwan, practices Humanistic Buddhism.<br>
<br>
In 1976, Master Hsing Yun, the founder of the order, represented a Buddhist group from Taiwan to participate in America's bicentennial celebration. Master Hsing Yun was asked by American friends to build a monastery in the United States. Therefore, Fo Guang Shan asked the Venerable Tzu Chuang (who, upon the inception of the temple, became the founding and first abbess of Hsi Lai Temple) and Yi Heng to plan and organize the construction of the temple in the Greater Los Angeles area. It was officially registered under the name of International Buddhist Progress Society. Until the temple was complete, Ven. Tzu Chuang bought an old church building, which was to be Hsi Lai's temporary headquarters. The original temple, located in the city of Maywood, was called the Bai Ta (White Pagoda) Temple...</div></blockquote>

<br>
In Taiwan, Hsing Yun is notable for his activity in political affairs, particularly as a supporter of the One-China policy as well as government legislation supported by the Kuomintang, and has been criticized for his views by those in favor of Taiwan independence and by religious figures, as being overtly political and "considerably far afield from traditional monastic concerns".[14][15] During the 2008 presidential election, Hsing Yun publicly endorsed Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou.[16] During the second World Buddhist Forum in 2009, Hsing Yun asserted that there are "no Taiwanese" and that Taiwanese "are Chinese".[15] In 2012 he said that the Senkaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyutai Islands) belonged to China.[17]<br>
<br>
In the past he has encouraged reconciliation between China and the Dalai Lama,[18] but has tried hard to avoid causing rifts between him and his organisation and the Chinese government</div></blockquote>

In 2003, BLIA was granted the NGO association status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and Department of Public Information (DPI).<br>
