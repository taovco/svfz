			<div class="content">There is currently speculation on social media as to whether Klaus Schwab is related to the Rothschilds or not. <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/8jiw39.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/8jiw39.jpg</a>  As a few people pointed out, Klaus Schwab was not mentioned in the original article.. However, this story led me to a very interesting rabbithole... <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Fred Schwab was born in Frankfurt. In 1935, he managed to leave Germany. His wife Marianne, née Rothschild, came from the town of Bad Homburg. After the 1938 Pogroms, she fled to the USA via Britain. The couple visited their former country as guests of the City of Frankfurt, to which they kept close emotional ties. Both returned often, met former classmates and spoke at schools. Their daughter Madeleine was invited by the City of Bad Homburg in 2013. She attended the opening ceremony for a deportation memorial in her mother’s home town. From here, her grandparents had been deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942...<br>
<br>
Fred Schwab was born as Friedrich Ernst Schwab into a Jewish family with a centuries-old history in Germany and Frankfurt.<br>
<br>
Born into this metropolitan city in 1918, he grew up at Rheinstraße 7 in Frankfurt’s Westend district and visited the nearby Goethe-Gymnasium. Fred’s father owned a large business at Moselstraße 4 (Gebr. Feisenberger. Kurzwaren, Spielwaren, Strumpfwaren). The family was firmly established among Frankfurt’s society. His parents married at the traditional Frankfurter Hof hotel, together with Christian and Jewish friends. The family was not very religious and attended the liberal Westend Synagogue. They celebrated “Weihnukka”: Hanukkah as well as Christmas (“Weihnachten” in German).<br>
<br>
When Hitler was installed, the family did not even remotely consider leaving the country....<br>
<br>
In 1992, 55 years after fleeing Germany, Fred Schwab came back to Frankfurt as an official guest. The Project Jewish Life in Frankfurt arranged for him to speak at his former school, Goethe-Gymnasium. His wife Marianne and daughter Madeleine accompanied him. Marianne Rothschild and Friedrich Schwab had known each other in Frankfurt and later reunited and married in the USA.<br>
<br>
Marianne Schwab, née Rothschild: “I always feel a little homesick for Bad Homburg”..<br>
<br>
Marianne was born in Frankfurt in 1919. She grew up in the town of Bad Homburg, where her father, Louis Rothschild, managed a bank. The family lived right downtown at Louisenstraße. Unlike Fred Schwab’s family, the Rothschilds, were very religious and active members of the Jewish congregation. Marianne first attended the girl’s high school (Lyzeum) in Bad Homburg (today Humboldtschule). Later, she began an apprenticeship as a kinesitherapist. .. On 17 March 1939, Marianne left Germany together with her grandmother. Her brother, Eduard, called Edu, was sent to the Netherlands. From here, he tried desperately, but without success, to also reach the USA...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Bankhaus Rothschild<br>
Members of the very spread-out Rothschild family already lived in Homburg in 1649. The house at Louisenstraße 97, built in 1843, was bought by Moritz Rothschild in 1876 at the latest. <span style="color:#FF0040">The Rothschilds acted as financiers for the Blanc brothers</span> as well as financial donors for the construction of the synagogue in 1863. In 1930, banker Louis Rothschild was the chairman of the Jewish community. Moritz Rothschild was dispossessed of his private bank in 1937 during the course of National Socialism's “Aryanization”. The house at Louisenstraße 97 came into the possession of the city at the end of 1938.

François Blanc <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Blanc" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Blanc</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>François Blanc (French: [fʁɑ̃swa blɑ̃]; 12 December 1806 – 27 July 1877), nicknamed "The Magician of Homburg" and "The Magician of Monte Carlo", was a French entrepreneur and operator of casinos, including the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco. His daughter, Marie-Félix, married Prince Roland Bonaparte and had issue.<br>
<br>
François was born on 12 December 1806 with his twin brother Louis. They grew up in a small town and were impressed every time circus came with a show - it seemed so interesting and simple so they followed the circus to learn all the tricks of the trade, boys were dreaming to become rich and successful and learnt so much and worked on different jobs.<br>
<br>
The brothers started to work in gambling business in Marseilles and earning some money brothers decided to develop their business and started to speculate on government pensions and got into real estate development. In that way they attracted attention to their business and were arrested, but not for a long time because law was not adopted yet for such cases. They were released and moved to Paris, but after King Louis Philippe passed new laws they had to move again - to Luxembourg. They ran profitable business there but it was just the first little step to their success in Hesse-Homburg near Frankfurt, where brothers signed a contract with a monarch because of debts of the city and in order to develop tourism industry.<br>
<br>
One innovation was the introduction of the single 0 style roulette wheel in 1843.[citation needed] This allowed Bad Homburg to compete against the casinos of Paris which offered the traditional wheel with both single and double zero house pockets. <span style="color:#FF0040">A legend says that François Blanc supposedly bargained with the devil to obtain the secrets of roulette. The legend is based on the fact that the sum of all the numbers on the roulette wheel (from 0 to 36) is 666, which is the "Number of the Beast".</span>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Frankfurt outlawed gambling in the early 1860s, which affected Bad Homburg and other towns in the region. The German city felt that they no longer needed casinos to draw tourists.<br>
<br>
This decision left the Wizard of Homburg quickly searching for a way to continue his lucrative gambling operation. He found a willing partner in the Monaco royal family.

Devil's wheel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_wheel" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_wheel</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A Devil's wheel, Teufelsrad, <span style="color:#FF0040">Human Roulette Wheel </span>or Joy Wheel[1] is an amusement ride at public festivals and fairs. Devil's wheels have been used at Oktoberfest celebrations since at least 1910..<br>
<br>
In Evelyn Waugh's first published novel, Decline and Fall, the character Otto Silenus describes a Devil's Wheel (referred to as the <span style="color:#FF0040">"big wheel at Luna Park"</span>) as a metaphor for life.
</div></blockquote>

Just a couple of days earlier I came across an intriguing story to do with Luna Park Sydney.. but I'll get into that in the comments.. Of course, the Devil's Wheel is another name for the Ferris Wheel...<br>
<br>
I've noted the possible occult connections of the Ferris Wheel in previous posts... <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;p=7975#p7975" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;p=7975#p7975</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>During the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, a structure that was designed to make the world marvel received its giant axle from Bethlehem Iron. The world's first Ferris wheel needed enough steel to assemble a 140-foot tower to support an all-steel wheel, altogether making a 264-foot (80 m) structure. The iron made in Bethlehem Steel's blast furnaces was responsible for the world's largest single piece of cast iron that had ever been made up to that time...</div></blockquote>

and re the history of carnival fairs and the ferris wheel .. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3811108/23746964" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3811108/23746964</a><br>

<br>
And of course there are Ferris Wheels popping up in major cities as landmarks.. eg the London Eye.. no, not the All Seeing Eye.. *cough* .. but the London Eye...<br>

Are the Event 201 Coronavirus Simulation and Jeffrey Epstein's Harvard program of Evolutionary Dynamics linked? I think so.. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3702405" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3702405</a><br>

<br>
J. Doyne Farmer (born 22 June 1952) is an American complex systems scientist and entrepreneur with interests in chaos theory, complexity and econophysics. He is a Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University, where he is Director of the Complexity Economics at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, and is also an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute.<br>
<br>
While still in graduate school, Farmer and his childhood friend Norman Packard formed a group called Eudaemonic Enterprises.[1] Their goal was to beat the game of roulette and use the proceeds to form a science commune .. [That's a whole other post]<br>

<br>
After the roulette project Farmer switched his dissertation topic to chaotic dynamics and joined together with James P. Crutchfield, Norman Packard, and Robert Shaw to found the Dynamical Systems Collective (subsequently known by others as the Chaos Cabal)<br>
<br>
And we know of Jeffrey Epstein's links to the Santa Fe Insititute. The Santa Fe Institute is known for its research into complex social systems and swarm theory. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2973511/16144347" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2973511/16144347</a><br>
<br>
Joshua Epstein (no relation to Jeffrey) is an expert on swarm theory and one of the things he's interested in is how to 'nudge' large groups of people into certain patterns of behaviour.<br>
<br>
The swarm development group is dedicated to agent-based modelling <a href="https://twitter.com/swarmABM" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/swarmABM</a>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum (HNF) in Paderborn, Germany, is the largest computer museum in the world (as of 2018).[citation needed] It is named after the Paderborn computer pioneer and entrepreneur Heinz Nixdorf.<br>
<br>
In 1977, Heinz Nixdorf received numerous gifts in the form of historic office machines at the celebrations for the company anniversary of 25 years of Nixdorf Computer AG, which gave him the idea of expanding them into a collection for a computer museum.[1] The museum idea became more concrete in 1983/1984 through purchases with the support of the Cologne office machine expert Uwe Breker. In 1985, the entrepreneur had his first exhibition concept drawn up by Prof. Ludwig Thürmer and his partners, but it was still undecided on the location. In 1986, Heinz Nixdorf died unexpectedly.

<br>
Each time Pentagon strategist Dr. Fritz Kraemer spoke about the strained strategic relations between France and the US in NATO, he ended with the remark to French officers, "If our deterrence and defense strategies against the USSR go wrong, we will all hang next to each other." Times have changed however, and France is not only back in NATO, but also has evolved as an active and reliable partner in the Alliance, taking responsibility for global security, justice and human rights in places such as Libya first and now Mali...<br>
<br>
Following his dogma that radicals have to be met with thoroughgoing containment, and that diplomacy never works without the ability to resort to force, Fritz Kraemer would have very much appreciated the recent military engagements of France. Hence it was the right moment to discuss Dr. Kraemer's legacy, his aphorisms and his ideas together with distinguished French officers and strategists in Paris.<br>
<br>
The strategic salon by invitation of the <span style="color:#FF0040">World Security Network was chaired and moderated by its founder Dr. Hubertus Hoffmann</span>, who could enjoy Fritz Kraemer's mentorship for 25 years and has recently published a biography about the legendary strategist and spiritual father of some of the most influential American statesman, including Henry Kissinger or Alexander Haig. Accordingly, the essence of the book "True Keeper of the Holy Flame - The Legacy of Pentagon Strategist and Mentor Dr Fritz Kraemer" found its way into the discussion (more on: <a href="http://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/fritzkraemer" class="postlink">www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/fritzkraemer</a>)...<br>
<br>
Following a welcome speech by <span style="color:#FF0040">hosts Nicole Junkermann and LtCol ret Dr. Mario Ohle</span>, the discussion was opened with statements from French Admirals Pierre Lacoste and Jean Dufourcq on the topic "France and Germany and the EU in a World 3.0 - What we can learn from Pentagon Strategist Dr Fritz Kraemer for creating a better common Foreign and Seucrity Policy". The audience in the grand salon included Germany's Deputy Military Attaché LtCol Frank Fischer, members of the Young Presidents Organization and WPO like Pierre-Marcel Blanchot, First Secretary of the Dutch Embassy Daniel Stork, representatives of the Paris office of the German Marshal Fund, young editors of the World Security Network Foundation like Dr. Jeannette Princess zu Fürstenberg and members of the Youth Atlantic Treaty Association.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Luna Park Sydney is a heritage-listed amusement park located at 1 Olympic Drive in the harbourside suburb of Milsons Point, New South Wales, Australia, on the northern shore of Sydney Harbour. The amusement park is owned by the Luna Park Reserve Trust, an agency of the Government of New South Wales, and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010..<br>
<br>
The park was constructed during 1935 approximately 600 metres (2,000 ft) from the northern approaches of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and ran for seventy-month seasons until 1972, when it was opened year-round. Luna Park was closed in mid-1979, immediately following <span style="color:#FF0040">the Ghost Train fire, which killed six children and one adult</span>. Most of the park was demolished, and a new amusement park was constructed; this originally operated under the name of Harbourside Amusement Park before resuming the Luna Park name. ..<br>
<br>
A consortium named <span style="color:#FF0040">World Trade Centre Pty Ltd</span> purchased the site and lease for $750,000.[7]: 99  Hopkins and Barton, the last of the 'original showmen' that had built, run, and maintained the park, retired in 1970, leaving the park in the hands of the purchasing consortium.[7]: 99  Soon after this, World Trade Centre Pty Ltd applied to construct a $50 million international trade centre on the Luna Park site, consisting of seven high-rise buildings, 929,000 square metres (10,000,000 sq ft) of exhibition space, and a heliport...<br>
<br>
Exposed: The Ghost Train Fire<br>
In March 2021, Australia's national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), screened a three-part investigative series by journalist Caro Meldrum-Hanna, Exposed: The Ghost Train Fire.[17][18] The series investigated potential evidence around the fire and the personalities involved, interviewing all surviving family of the fire's victims, along with many judicial figures and police investigators of the time, and alleged witnesses and some former park staff. The investigation also brought to light much of Sharp's evidence from his archive of files and tapes on the case. The investigation concluded that a web of criminality extending between Saffron, former NSW Premier Neville Wran, former High Court Justice Lionel Murphy and organised crime boss Jack Rooklyn was responsible for the fire, with Saffron allegedly ordering the lighting of the fire which was carried out by a group of 'bikies', so Saffron could gain control of the lease on the 'crown land' (land protected by the state government) on which Luna Park stood. The program suggested that a new coronial inquiry or Royal Commission into the case should be opened, with all the new evidence taken into account...<br>
<br>
Luna Park has strong association with former park artists Rupert Browne, Peter Kingston, Gary Shead, Sam Lipson, Arthur Barton, Richard Liney and Martin Sharp. Martin Sharp is an important Sydney artist with an international reputation who was influential in the Australian Pop Art movement in the 1960s and 70s...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Sharp’s participation in the 1960s and 1970s counterculture movements in <br>
Sydney and London provided him with the skills and tactics to advocate for Luna Park. Several <br>
crises, including the 1979 ghost train fire and a redevelopment proposal for the site in 1989, led <br>
Sharp to establish a formalised action group who successfully advocated for Luna Park to be <br>
recognised as a historically and culturally significant site on Sydney’s foreshore-  a  position <br>
which it continues to hold...<br>
<br>
..To  date,  the  significance  of  Martin  Sharp’s  contribution  as  an  activist  to  the  heritage <br>
listing  of  the  Luna  Park  precinct  has  not  received  a  full  examination.    Studies  on  successful <br>
heritage activism during this period, such as Verity and Meredith Burgmann’s Green Bans, Red <br>
Union, have typically focused on the heritage activism of urban green spaces and residential <br>
areas.. Emerging artists in Sydney were  also raising awareness of government censorship of <br>
political expression through art and literature.  One such artist was Martin Sharp (1942-2013).  <br>
A world-renowned pop-artist, cartoonist, film-maker, songwriter and enthusiastic promoter of <br>

<br>
As visitor numbers declined in the late 1960s, Luna Park’s leasehold was sold to Leon <br>
Finks’  World  Trade  Centre  Pty  Ltd  who  intended  to  redevelop  the  site.31   After  the  Harry <br>
Seidler-designed world trade centre redevelopment of the site was rejected by the NSW Askin <br>
Government,  the  Park’s  majority  shareholders,  Fink  and  Nathan  Spratt,  formed  Luna  Park <br>
(Holdings) Pty Ltd and continued to operate the site as an amusement park.32   The change in <br>
ownership of the Park from experienced amusement park owners and managers to developers <br>
and  entrepreneurs  led  to  the  facilities  at  Luna  Park  to  fall  into  decline. ..

</div></blockquote>

A sinister gap-tooth smile grinned from the cover. Martin Sharp’s image announced the arrival of London’s Oz magazine, the exuberant herald of the hippy era.<br>
<br>
The magazine would challenge the establishment, extol the virtues of drugs, sex and rock’n’roll and provoke a landmark obscenity case. Writers Germaine Greer, Lillian Roxon and Anthony Haden-Guest, who would go on to stellar careers, were among those who made early contributions.<br>
<br>
..Sharp was already notorious in Sydney, where he had twice been charged with obscenity over his cartoons. This included for Sydney’s Oz magazine, the forerunner of London Oz. Sharp had been central to the establishment of Sydney Oz in 1963 and, with its co-editors Neville and Richard Walsh, had been sentenced to six months’ jail, convictions later overturned.<br>
<br>
..In Britain, Oz initially struggled to find its feet. But when Sharp produced his alluring yet naïve “Plant a Flower Child” pin-up for the July issue, of captivating long-haired, blond flower children clad only in daisies, it helped transform the magazine’s fortunes as it became a leading voice of the underground or alternative society.<br>
<br>
Sharp cut up and collaged photographs of 16-year-old identical twins Michelle and Nicole Aloszko taken by his friend photographer Robert Whitaker. Best known for his images of the Beatles, Whitaker photographed the twins on a golf course near Ascot as they frolicked and peeked to camera.<br>
<br>
Into the image, Sharp inserted images of himself and Whitaker – with whom he shared a Chelsea studio – although it requires keen eyes to spot them. While the Beatles album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band became the soundtrack of the Summer of Love, Sharp’s day-glo “Plant a Flower Child” image made him its poster boy.<br>
<br>
Throughout his life, Sharp was surrounded and inspired by musicians. In London, they became his subjects. He created an image of Bob Dylan as a tribute to the musician he admired. The singer’s hair is a mass of circles, influenced by Leonardo da Vinci’s knot design and by Art Nouveau illustrator Aubrey Beardsley. In Dylan’s sunglasses, Sharp inverted a letter of the singer’s Blowin’ in the Wind to become Blowin’ in the Mind – and so captured the zeitgeist...<br>
<br>
As he worked on Oz Sharp also created album covers, notably for Cream’s Disraeli Gears, one of the seminal albums of 1967. By then Sharp had moved to the Pheasantry on Chelsea’s King’s Road where his flatmates included Eric Clapton. He had met Clapton by chance at a London nightclub where he had offered the musician some lyrics he had penned. The result was Tales of Brave Ulysses, which appeared on Disraeli Gears...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Of course, it was not only underage boys who were regarded as suitable sexual partners at the time. In his 1970 book Play Power, <span style="color:#FF0040">Neville (who was born in 1941) boasted of having a “hurricane f . . k” with a “moderately attractive, intelligent, cherubic fourteen-year-old girl from a nearby London comprehensive school</span>”. In the early 70s, the author of Play Power had no trouble in getting an ABC gig when he returned to Australia and in receiving support from the highest echelons in the ABC for inviting three pederasts on to his program.<br>
<br>
In his Quadrant article, Lansdown documented the existence in Australia at the time of a <span style="color:#FF0040">Paedophile Support Group</span>. In recent weeks there has been controversy (in The Mail and elsewhere) over the Paedophile Information Exchange which existed in Britain in the 70s and 80s. The PIE was affiliated with the National Council for Civil Liberties.<br>
<br>
Prominent members of the NCCL at the time included Patricia Hewitt (the Australian-born Labour MP who became a member of Tony Blair’s cabinet), Harriet Harman (currently the deputy leader of the British Labour Party) and Jack Dromey (the Labour spokesman on policing). As Toby Young has revealed in Britain’s The Daily Telegraph, in 1976 Hewitt, as the NCCL’s general secretary, issued a press release advocating that the age of consent should be lowered to 10 years of age. Hewitt has since apologised.<br>
<br>
At the time, the PIE advocated that the age of consent should be lowered to four years of age. As Rod Liddle commented in The Sunday Times, the NCCL was “perfectly happy for its affiliate” to advocate sex between adult men and four-year-olds. Liddle quoted the NCCL at the time saying that “childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in with an adult, result in no identifiable damage”.

Marianne Schwab passed her love for Bad Homburg on to her children. On the occasion of the unveiling of a memorial plaque at Bad Homburg train station to commemorate the deportations, the city of Bad Homburg invited Marianne Schwab's daughter Madeleine Gerrish to a visit at the suggestion of the Society for Christian-Jewish Cooperation Hochtaunus. Two larger transports left the Bad Homburg train station in 1942, on June 10, 1942 and August 28, 1942.

Perkins called David Martin a "tremendous person" who was retired from Motorola. He also was active with St. James Catholic Church in Arlington Heights and would give communion to those were unable to attend Mass, including people in nursing homes...
