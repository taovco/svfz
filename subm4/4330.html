In the same vein as [<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=69&amp;t=4322" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=69&amp;t=4322</a>], this post gives examples of radium products via this link which is well worth it's own post and worth reading all the text in the link.  (While many are abandoned products, apparently there are also some still available today).<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As part of nuclear-themed posts in the run-up to the Chernobyl anniversary on 26 April, this post covers radioactive elements in their heyday, right after they were first discovered.  There was a time when radiation from these elements was associated with the power of the sun - and the future.  As incredible as it may seem, radium, a highly radioactive element, was seen up to the middle of the last century as a health treatment.</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">The case of Eben Byers, Radithor (radioactive water) and the snake oil doctors who prescribed it.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Byers" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Byers</a><br>
"In 1927 Byers injured his arm falling from a railway sleeping berth. For the persistent pain a doctor suggested he take Radithor, a patent medicine manufactured by William J. A. Bailey.[4] Bailey was a Harvard University dropout who falsely claimed to be a doctor of medicine and had become rich from the sale of Radithor, a solution of radium in water which he claimed stimulated the endocrine system. He offered physicians a 1/6 kickback on each dose prescribed.[5]<br>
<br>
Byers began taking several doses of Radithor per day, believing it gave him a "toned-up feeling", but stopped in October 1930 (after taking some 1400 doses) when that effect faded. He lost weight and had headaches, and his teeth began to fall out. In 1931 the Federal Trade Commission asked him to testify about his experience, but he was too sick to travel so the commission sent a lawyer to take his statement at his home; the lawyer reported that Byers's "whole upper jaw, excepting two front teeth and most of his lower jaw had been removed" and that "All the remaining bone tissue of his body was disintegrating, and holes were actually forming in his skull."<br>
<br>

<br>
EDIT 2:  NSFW, includes pic of someone (presumably Eben Byers) without most of both jawbones <a href="https://insidemystery.com/haunted-history/eben-byers-radioactive-death" class="postlink">https://insidemystery.com/haunted-histo ... tive-death</a><br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
William J. A. Bailey himself died of bladder cancer in 1949 and 20 years later his exhumed body was found'ravaged by radiation'. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._A._Bailey" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._A._Bailey</a><br>
"In 1918, Bailey claimed that radium added to drinking water could be used to treat dozens of conditions, from mental illness and headaches to diabetes, anemia, constipation, and asthma.[4]<br>
<br>
In 1922 he had had some success selling medicines like Arium radium tablets (‘Radium!  Gives Super-Man Power’)[1] through his other company, Associated Radium Chemists Inc. The company also sold Linarium (radium liniment for aches and pains), Dentarium (radium dentifrice for teeth and gums) and Kaparium (radium hair tonic).[5]<br>
<br>
Bailey became rich from the sale of Radithor, a well known patent medicine/snake oil that is possibly the best known example of radioactive quackery. Bailey created Radithor by dissolving radium salts in water to deliver 1 microcurie of radiation from each of 226Ra and 228Ra, claiming its curative properties were due to stimulation of the endocrine system. Radithor was advertised as "A Cure for the Living Dead" as well as "Perpetual Sunshine"[6]<br>
<br>
In fact, Radithor was a lethal mixture, and was responsible for the death of Eben Byers in 1932, who died of radiation-induced cancer after drinking about 1,400 bottles of Radithor.[6][7]<br>
<br>
Bailey also invented the Radiendocrinator around 1930. This was a cased source, intended to be worn against the skin.[8]<br>
<br>
During World War II, Bailey was the wartime manager of the electronic division of International Business Machines."</div>
