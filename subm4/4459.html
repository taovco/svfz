<blockquote class="uncited"><div>September 11 transformed the global economy, the way wars are fought, and how the United States keep tabs on citizens. But it also revealed just how complex our world had quickly become in the years leading up to the attack. So complex, in fact, that in the months that followed, the government mandated a project to understand it.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, or NISAC</span>, was officially founded in 1999 as a collaboration between two national laboratories, Sandia and Los Alamos, managed by the Department of Energy. Three years later, NISAC’s mission–to model the behavior of fuel supply lines, the electrical grid, food supply chains, and other national infrastructure–was suddenly a matter of critical national import. “It was really 9/11 that focused the country’s attention on the vulnerability of domestic infrastructure,” says Lori Parrott, program manager at NISAC. Being able to simulate how an attack or disaster would affect those systems was no longer a rhetorical exercise, it was a reality.<br>
<br>
..The models that NISAC produces are not necessarily visually beautiful, but they are mathematically extraordinary. A map of an influenza pandemic spreading across the U.S. An flow chart of chemical supply chains in the Midwest. A diagram of how fear will influence human behavior in cities after a disaster. They’re ruthlessly utilitarian documents, created from NISAC’s advanced simulations of the systems that underpin our world–and what happens when they break.<br>
<br>
What Parrott describes as a “new discipline” is often called CASoS: Complex Adaptive Systems of Systems. That’s not a typo: systems of systems.<br>
<br>
..As early computers increased in processing power, scientists took advantage of the newfound ability to model data-heavy dynamic systems. In the ’60s, a physicist named Edward Lorentz used computer modeling to pioneer a totally new concept–chaos theory–by simulating the way weather moves around the globe. These ideas about modeling complex systems and randomness were groundbreaking for a huge range of disciplines over the next three decades, from biology to astronomy to artificial intelligence, as historian James Gleick describes in Chaos: Making A New Science. It was a potent concept in pop culture, too–after all, it spawned its own Ashton Kutcher thriller in 2004, The Butterfly Effect.<br>
<br>
..THE PANDEMIC AND THE FOREST FIRE<br>
A paper about pandemics from a former Sandia scientist named <span style="color:#FF0040">Robert J. Glass</span> offers a visceral example of what that really means. In 2005, at the height of the avian flu crisis, the Department of Homeland Security asked NISAC to put together a simulation of how the flu could escalate into a global pandemic for an exercise. It was the perfect CASoS: It involved everyone on Earth, all of their social networks, and all of the complex economic, cultural, and geographic systems that connect them. “What could we do to avert disaster?” Glass writes.<br>
<br>
..SIMULATING HOW HUMANS SURVIVE<br>
Over the coming decades, as climate change throws even more chaos into our daily lives, NISAC’s science could begin to shape more than just disaster contingencies...

Fourteen years ago, two federal government doctors, Richard Hatchett and Carter Mecher, met with a colleague at a burger joint in suburban Washington for a final review of a proposal they knew would be treated like a piñata: telling Americans to stay home from work and school the next time the country was hit by a deadly pandemic...<br>
<br>
How that idea — born out of a request by President George W. Bush to ensure the nation was better prepared for the next contagious disease outbreak — became the heart of the national playbook for responding to a pandemic is one of the untold stories of the coronavirus crisis...<br>
<br>
But what is this mention of the high-school daughter of 14? Her name is Laura M. Glass, and she recently declined to be interviewed when the Albuquerque Journal did a deep dive of this history.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Here are a bunch of links between people, organizations, crimes, over different decades but often involving the same players and same modes of operation. For example, look at what BCCI was up to, then look at Osama bin Laden’s work on terrorist financing (essentially an expansion of the type of work BCCI was doing), and then look at the way modern terrorists launder money today in holding companies, stocks, real estate, influence peddling schemes, et cetera...<br>
<br>
Nowadays terrorists just bank with HSBC and Citibank. No need for BCCI-like entities anymore. In the case of Alwaleed, he is the number one individual shareholder of Citibank. He was named by Moussaoui as a major funder of al Qaeda along with Bandar Bush, King Salman, and Turki bin Faisal among others. Alwaleed’s law partner famously helped Obama get into Harvard. Now Alwaleed’s got his own study center at the <span style="color:#FF0040">Harvard divinity school</span>. Anthony Weiner told Harvard not to accept the dirty money but that was before he shacked up with Hillary’s “body woman” Huma Abedin. Now Alwaleed’s an honorary ambassador to Israel even though he blamed Israel for 9/11. What a tangled web this will all end up being once it finally gets unraveled.</div></blockquote>

..But if we can maintain the Internet as the forum of the world – the place where<br>
people meet to trade, to organize and to discuss – then we can reap ever more<br>
benefits from the more perfect distribution of information to multiple points of<br>
decision-making, from the resulting more efficient production, and from growth in<br>
trade and employment. The move of many human activities online also has a huge<br>
potential to decrease the energy intensity of economic growth and development.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>814 – “The Future of Energy” with NASA Chief Scientist, <span style="color:#FF0040">Dennis Bushnell, Langley, VA</span>   In this program, Hazel Henderson and NASA Chief Scientist Dennis Bushnell review all the issues around the increasing global shift from polluting fossil fuels and their effect on climate to economies. They discuss today’s harvesting of solar, wind, geothermal, hydro and oceans, as well as the cost savings from more efficient buildings, batteries electric vehicles and charging stations, smarter cities and urban design, public transport and the future of decentralized energy, especially in developing countries. Both Henderson and Bushnell agree that there is ample renewable energy from our Sun for all existing and foreseen human societies’ needs. The issues concern the politics of incumbent interests and the re-design of green infrastructure so as to utilize and scale up all our existing renewable technologies now available, as tracked in the Green Transition Scoreboard ®.

..During this time, Greenway Consulting was working with other clients allied to the design professions who became enthusiastic about supporting the network. Those clients included Cecil Steward of the University of Nebraska, Doug Parker of Steelcase, Jonas Salk of the Salk Institute, Jerry Hobbs and Paul Curran of BPI/VNU Communications, and Arol Wolford of CMD. In addition, principal leaders from Gensler; Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; Hammel, Green and Abrahamson; Perkins and Will; CommArts; and two dozen other firms provided leadership vision and energy.<br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter, this leadership network officially became the Design Futures Council. They met in the offices of Greenway Consulting in Washington, D.C., and in meeting rooms at the Smithsonian Institution’s Castle. Invitations for programs and sharing of ideas came from the American Institute of Architects, the American Consulting Engineers Council, the Industrial Designers Society of America, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, <span style="color:#FF0040">the World Future Societ</span>y, the International Interior Design Association, the American Society of Interior Designers, the Design-Build Institute, the Design Management Institute, and many colleges and universities.<br>

..In September 2015, King Salman of Saudi Arabia rented every single room at the Four Seasons Hotel in order to accommodate his entourage while he met with President Barack Obama. The hotel added an extensive amount of gold gilded furniture and laid red carpet in every hallway in order to meet the royal party's tastes.[9] In that same month, Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts sold itself to The Blackstone Group for $6 billion, giving the Four Seasons its first change in ownership.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>By Martin Bright, Former Website Editor With Tony Blair Faith Foundation<br>
<br>
Tony Blair fixed me with his steely grey-blue eyes: ‘You know what I would really like? I want an interactive map of all the madrasas in the world ranked according to how radical they are.’<br>
<br>
At first I thought he was joking, but it soon became clear he was in earnest. <br>
<br>
I suggested that this was perhaps beyond the scope of our intelligence services, let alone my small team in the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. He looked a little disappointed...But this was not the first time the former prime minister had seemed to imagine he still had an army of civil servants to do his bidding. <br>
<br>
Nor would it be the last in my five-month spell at the heart of his strange new empire, a spider’s web of charities, funds, diplomatic activities and money-making enterprises. <br>
<br>
In my time there, I found much that felt fittingly familiar in a sofa-government sort of way: there were bean bags; young, enthusiastic staff; morale-boosting doughnut breaks and occasional ‘Town Hall’ meetings to get things off our collective chest.<br>
<br>
But plenty that was more puzzling – or frankly weird.<br>
<br>
Why, for example, did a small interfaith advisory group need ritzy offices in a West End tower block? <br>
<br>
Why did it need no fewer than five press, or ‘comms’, officers recruited from the ranks of special advisers and Downing Street insiders? <br>
<br>
And why does Tony, as he is ubiquitously known, still work with a prime ministerial ‘red box’ for his urgent reading matter, a curious hangover from his days at No 10?<br>
<br>
Yet the task he had given me was thoroughly worthwhile. <br>
<br>
Starting in January this year, I had been hired to run a website called Religion And Geopolitics, and my brief was to bring together expert academics and journalists to increase the understanding of conflict zones where religion played a role.<br>
<br>
What could be more important?<br>
<br>
The Faith Foundation is just one part of ‘Blair Inc’, as it has been described, a minor constellation of associated projects  There is a Tony Blair Sports Foundation in the North East of England and an Africa Governance Initiative in Marble Arch. <br>
<br>
Tony Blair Associates is the business arm that co-ordinates all those speeches and consultancies, while the co-ordinating hub – his private office – is located near the former American Embassy in Grosvenor Square.<br>
<br>
At the summit of this stellar hierarchy is the Office of the Quartet Representative, his Middle East Peace Envoy work, based in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
My small patch, the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, was based with the Africa Governance Initiative on the upper floors of Marble Arch Tower, a well-appointed building with commanding views of Hyde Park, just around the corner from the Blairs’ Connaught Square home. There was no doubting Tony’s enthusiasm for the website. It seemed to be a personal passion and I got more ‘face time’ than I ever did in my days as a mere journalist. As at Downing Street, visitors to Tony’s Grosvenor Square office find themselves ushered through several ante-chambers, before entering the inner sanctum.  The reception is dotted with pictures of Blair meeting political leaders from around the world. <br>
<br>
The decor was corporate: spartan cream and white, dotted with contemporary art. The office of a private wealth management firm, perhaps. Tony greeted me with the suave diffidence of a high-class butler; then, flanked by Catherine Rimmer, a former No 10 official who acts as his eyes and ears, proceeded to grill me from a high-backed chair.  I felt myself slowly slide down into the dark leather of the guest sofa. He runs the whole thing like a government-in-waiting with – he claimed in his autobiography – 130 staff, which is more than the actual Prime Minister, David Cameron, employs at Downing Street. Indeed, as time went on, Tony’s private office began to treat my website as its own think-tank, or government department, with regular calls for briefings on the Middle East, radical Islam or particular conflicts. There is no wasted conversation or small talk. If Tony thinks a point is nonsense he will say so without disguise. <br>
<br>
He is utterly focused on what you say. And the smile is infectious. I emerged from our meetings with a fixed grin and aching facial muscles. I started to feel as if I was in the presence of an Old Testament prophet. The answers had been revealed to him. And he was revealing them to the world. It became clear that he was less interested in the journalistic and academic aspects of the site, and very keen on specific data, from numbers of adherents through to levels of radicalisation. It was as if his religious faith had driven him to seek the one truth – and that he believed he could find this through statistics. Looking back, even the interview for the post had been a little odd.  I was far from the obvious choice. As a former political editor of the Left-wing New Statesman magazine, I had often been hostile to the New Labour project.<br>
‘Was there anything that might disqualify me for the post?’ the panel asked. ‘Well...’ I began nervously. ‘I have been somewhat critical of Tony Blair…’ No matter. I was in and, at the start of this year, found myself in the open-plan offices of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.  Despite the bean bags, it was oddly hierarchical, with surprisingly strict reporting structures.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">It is run by a young chief executive, Charlotte Keenan</span>, a formidable woman with a sharp intellect, a banking background and a husband, Robin Walker, who is Conservative MP for Worcester.  Corporate gobbledegook was inescapable. We were forever ‘going forward’ or ‘actioning’ this and that.  There were weekly staff meetings and, twice a year, something described as ‘Town Hall’ meetings to let us air our concerns. Every Thursday, senior management bought pastries for the staff. We were given monthly training sessions in which we were informed about world religion. One featured a video on ‘spiritual direction’ by <span style="color:#FF0040">Caroline Welby, the wife of the Archbishop of Canterbury.</span> There were no goons in shades. The Blair operation is subtler than that: more global asset management than Russian oligarch. The Faith Foundation is an independent charity with Tony Blair as its patron. He is not supposed to have any executive role. <br>
<br>
We tiptoed around Blair’s business interests in Kazakhstan, Romania and the Gulf. Stories that the charity’s patron might be advising the new government of Egypt were a nightmare.  Our first crisis came towards the end of January, when Harvard Divinity School pulled out of the website project altogether, apparently angered by one of Tony’s newspaper articles headlined, ‘Extremist religion is at the root of 21st-century wars’...<br>
<br>
In February I was told to accompany the chief executive on a trip to Vienna for a gathering of organisations seeking to map data about religious conflict and reconciliation around the world. This had the Orwellian title Mapping The Mappers and was hosted by the Saudi-funded King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue (KAICIID). This is the Wahabi-inspired regime doing ‘cuddly’.  I said I was uncomfortable, considering Saudi Arabia was one of the most oppressive countries on Earth, with a complete absence of religious diversity. I wondered whether we should be allowing this organisation to pay for our trip, and continued to wonder as we entered its beautiful old headquarters, a jarring combination of Klimt murals and Gulf kitsch.<br>
<br>
Indeed, as the weeks went by, I began to doubt the point of being at the Foundation at all. Huge amounts of time were spent in meetings to ensure the website didn’t embarrass Blair. Why, I wondered, did such a small charity have a five-person communications department whose sole aim seemed to be to say as little as possible?

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Lovelock is the founder of the modern earth-worshiping Gaia movement. His book The Ages of<br>
Gaia (1982) postulates that the earth is a living organism which has the capacity to heal itself under<br>
natural conditions but that man’s technology has overwhelmed it and doomed it to destruction without radical intervention (Henry Lamb, The Rise of Global Green Religion,<br>
<a href="http://freedom.org/reports/ggreligion.htm" class="postlink">http://freedom.org/reports/ggreligion.htm</a>). Lovelock believes that Gaia is a spirit goddess that began evolving life on earth billions of years ago and that everything on earth is part of Gaia. Lovelock told the Global Survival Conference, “On Earth, she is the source of life everlasting and is alive now; she gave birth to humankind and we are a part of her” (Shared Vision, Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival, vol. 3, no. 1, 1989, p. 3).<br>
<br>
The Global Forum held another conference in 1990, this time in Moscow. It was co-sponsored by<br>
the <span style="color:#FF0040">Temple of Understanding</span> and the UN Global Committee of Parliamentarians on Population and<br>
Development. Al Gore was there. Mikhail Gorbachev waved his environmental flag by calling for<br>
an “International Green Cross,” an NGO agency to protect “endangered life forms.” The 700 “spiritual and parliamentary” leaders included UN General Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellar, Carl Sagan, the Grand Mufti of Fyria, Catholic Cardinal Joseph Bernadine, Ronald Thiemann, dean of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Harvard Divinity School</span>, James Hansen of NASA, and atheist Stephen Gould of Harvard University. Sagan called on scientists and religious leaders to join hands in a new environmentalist alliance. This is not a difficult step, as they all believe in evolution.</div></blockquote>

So, the gist of it is, the CIA has a history of using secret financing programs to finance Occult organizations and research; organizations that are made to look like public endowments, or whatever. The point is, there’s a public face to the organizations that masks their true purpose...<br>

..So back to the <span style="color:#FF0040">Temple of Understanding </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Understanding" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Understanding</a><br>
<br>
In 1996, in support and affirmation of individuals whose life work has advanced the interfaith ideal, the Temple of Understanding established the Juliet Hollister Awards Ceremony<br>
<br>
Past awardees that caught me attention include:<br>
<br>
Prince El Hassan bin Talal,<br>
Henry Luce III ...Skull and Bones, Century Club<br>
Davison kept Henry Luce in charge of the (TIME-LIFE) company as president, as he and Luce were both members of Yale’s Skull and Bones secret society, being initiated in 1920. In 1946 Davison and Luce then made C. D. Jackson, former head of U.S. Psychological Warfare, vice-president of Time-Life. It seems to me that the entire operation at Time-Life was purely for spreading propaganda to the American public for the purposes of the intelligence community, J.P. Morgan, and the elite.  <a href="http://archive.is/sYOrw" class="postlink">http://archive.is/sYOrw</a><br>
<br>
In the Executive Intelligence Review of June 25, 2004, Steven P. Meyer and Jeffrey Steinberg explain:<br>
<br>
Luce’s personal lawyer, who would come to represent his entire media empire, was his brother-in-law Tex Moore, of Cravath, deGersdorff, Swaine and Wood, the same firm which deployed both Allen and John Foster Dulles to facilitate bringing Hitler to power in the early 1930s.<br>
<br>
Luce was an intimate of Britain’s Lord Beaverbrook and the Prince of Wales, who were notoriously pro-Hitler and members of the Cliveden set. He also formed an extremely close relationship with Winston Churchill, himself a promoter of Hitler in the early 1930s.<br>
<br>
I have somewhat recent posts on Luce, Wasson, Skull and Bones, CFR, Nazi roots of CIA and MKULTRA<br>
<br>
Nelson Mandela, "The Elders"<br>
<br>
NYU Center for Spiritual Life Development Team (Chelsea Clinton, Imam Khalid Latif, and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna).<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Juliet Hollister (l.) with her good friend <span style="color:#FF0040">Barbara Marx Hubbard</span> at a 1997 Stanford University planning conference during United Religions Initiative’s formation...<br>
<br>
The Temple of Understanding has chapters overseas and was based in New York at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights before moving in the 1990's to its present center, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">THE WICCA CULT: The WICCA cult came to the surface early during the post-war period, as a legalized association for the promotion of witchcraft. It is the leading publicly known international association of witches in the world today. In the United States, WICCA's outstanding sponsor is the New York Anglican (Episcopal) diocese, under Bishop Paul Moore. Officially, New York's Anglican Cathedral of St. John the Divine has promoted the spread of WICCA witchery through its Lindisfarne center. The late Gregory Bateson conducted such an operation out of the Lindisfarne center during the 1970s.<br>
<br>
No later than the 1970s, and perhaps still today, the crypt of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, is the headquarters for solemn ceremonies of the British (Venerable) Order of Malta. Key figures, such as Gregory Bateson's former spouse, Dame Margaret Mead, associated with that British order, have been associated with projects in support of the Satanist "Age of Aquarius" cause.</em> -- Real History of Satanism, by Lyndon LaRouche<br>
<br>
Mrs. Hollister's husband, Dickerman Hollister, died in 1983. She is survived by their two sons, G. Clay, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Dickerman Jr., of Greenwich; a daughter, Catharine H. Ecton of Cabin John, Md.; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.</div></blockquote></div>
