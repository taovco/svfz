<blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">"We believe it is a method of reducing the number of births in a community that is black and mostly poor," Hedva Eyal, who wrote the report admitting the eugenic practice.</em><br>
<br>
 JERUSALEM, January 31, 2013, (LifeSiteNews.com) – After a series of back and forth accusations and denials among government agencies, the Israeli Health Ministry has for the first time acknowledged that it has been injecting Ethiopian immigrants who are religiously Jewish with the dangerous contraceptive Depo-Provera without their consent.<br>
<br>
 The allegation that the women were coerced into accepting the shot was denied at first by both the Joint Distribution Committee, which runs the clinics at the transit camps, and by the Health Ministry. The practice has been said to be going on for years. <br>
<br>
Ethiopian Jews accounted for 57 percent of Depo-Provera users in Israel, although they constitute a miniscule percentage of the population. <br>
<br>
According to a Haaretz report, women in transit camps in Ethiopia waiting to emigrate to Israel were either told the birth control injection was mandatory, or that the injection was simply for immunization.<br>
<br>
“We said we won't have the shot,” one woman told the Israeli newspaper. “They told us, if you don't, you won't go to Israel. And also you won't be allowed into the Joint (American Joint Distribution Committee) office, you won't get aid or medical care.”<br>
<br>
“We were afraid,” recounted Emawayish, who immigrated from Ethiopia eight years ago. “We didn't have a choice. Without them and their aid we couldn't leave there. So, we accepted the injection. It was only with their permission that we were allowed to leave.”<br>
<br>
 “They told us they are inoculations,” said another women interviewed for the investigative report. “They told us people who frequently give birth suffer. We took it every three months. We said we didn’t want to.”<br>
<br>
“We believe it is a method of reducing the number of births in a community that is black and mostly poor,” Hedva Eyal, who wrote the report admitting the eugenic practice. In recent years, Israeli schools have denied Ethiopian children enrollment in schools, and the government has engaged in mass deportations of African immigrants, to preserve “the Jewish character of the state.” Ethiopians also have more than three-times the poverty rate of other Israelis.  <br>
<br>
The situation came to light following an investigative report aired in early December on the Israel Educational Television program “Vacuum.”<br>
<br>
The Jewish Agency, which is responsible for Jewish immigration from abroad, distanced itself from the accusations saying that “while the JA has never held family planning workshops for this group in Ethiopia or at immigrant absorption centers in Israel, the immigrant transit camp in Gondar, as the investigation noted, was previously operated by other agencies.”</div></blockquote>

FDA blasts, WHO downplays, risks of Depo-Provera contraceptive:<br>
<br>
Excerpts:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Fri Oct 30, 2015 - 12:41 pm EDT<br>
<br>
NEW YORK, October 30, 2015 (C-Fam) A week before a huge global family planning conference in Indonesia, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a short statement reiterating its position that injectable contraceptives are safe – for any duration – even for adolescents despite being linked to progressive bone density loss and other harmful side effects.<br>
<br>
It came shortly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), widely regarded as the “gold standard” on drug safety, rejected a petition to remove its strong “black box” warning label and reiterated its concerns about the contraceptives’ long-term effects on women’s health.<br>
<br>
Women around the world who want to postpone or avoid pregnancy cite health risks as one of the most prevalent reasons for not using modern contraceptives.<br>
<br>
Their concerns are backed by science. In this case, injectable contraceptives containing depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), also known as Depo-Provera, have been linked with decreased bone density, increased risk of certain cancers, and increased risk of HIV.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Last year the drug manufacturer Pfizer, the Gates Foundation, USAID and other groups announced a major collaboration to increase use of injectable contraceptives among poor women in developing countries using a single-use syringe called Sayana Press.</span><br>
<br>
Mindful of the global push for Depo-Provera and the weight that FDA warnings carry, two doctors submitted a petition in 2013 urging the FDA to remove the “black box” warning, claiming that it “has harmed public health in the United States and around the world.” One doctor is a consultant for a company that markets Depo-Provera and the other is an outspoken abortion advocate who asserts that abortion is safer than childbirth.</div></blockquote>
