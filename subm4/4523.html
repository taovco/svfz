Police and prosecutors failed children who reported being sexually abused by Labour grandee Lord Janner by covering up key evidence, report finds:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>    Lord Janner was charged with 22 counts of child sexual abuse offences in 2015<br>
    He died with dementia that year while awaiting trial; he denied all the allegations<br>
    Now a damning inquiry has concluded that children who reported sexual abuse by the late Labour grandee were 'let down by institutional failings'<br>
<br>
Police and prosecutors failed children who reported being sexually abused by Labour grandee Lord Janner by covering up key evidence, an official report has found.<br>
<br>
The former MP, who died in 2015, was accused of serious sexual abuse over three decades by 34 alleged victims. <br>
<br>
Offences were said to have taken place in the Houses of Parliament, Lord Janner's car, children's homes and a hotel.<br>
<br>
The report by the Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse found Leicestershire Police deliberately withheld key witness statements from the Crown Prosecution Service. <br>
<br>
It said Detective Superintendent Christopher Thomas and CPS lawyer Roger Rock appeared 'reluctant to progress the investigation'.<br>
<br>
Lord Janner, a Leicester MP from 1970 until 1997 when he was made a peer, was charged with 22 child sexual abuse offences, relating to nine boys, in 2015. <br>
<br>
He was suffering dementia and died later that year aged 87 while awaiting trial. He always denied the offences.<br>
<br>
Allegations first emerged three decades ago. A report by retired judge Sir Richard Henriques found in 2016 that police and prosecutors missed three chances to charge Lord Janner in the 1990s.<br>
<br>
Professor Alexis Jay, who is leading the abuse inquiry, said: 'Despite numerous serious allegations against the late Lord Janner, police and prosecutors appeared reluctant to fully investigate the claims against him. <br>
<br>
'On multiple occasions police put too little emphasis on looking for supporting evidence and shut down investigations without pursuing all outstanding inquiries.' <br>
<br>
The report, which did not examine whether allegations against Lord Janner were true, described the decision-making of Detective Superintendent Thomas and Mr Rock as 'unsound and strategically flawed'.<br>
<br>
Current Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Cole said: 'It is fair and correct to say that the allegations could and should have been investigated more thoroughly. <br>
<br>
'And Lord Janner could and should have faced prosecution earlier than 2015.' <br>
<br>
A CPS spokesman said: 'We have co-operated fully with the inquiry and will carefully consider its conclusions.'<br>
<br>
Lord Janner's family have maintained that he is innocent and criticised the inquiry hearings as 'a one-sided trial against a dead man'.  </div></blockquote>

Why did Keith Vaz protect Greville Janner? (2016 article):<br>
<a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2016/09/04/why-did-keith-vaz-protect-greville-janner/" class="postlink">https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2 ... le-janner/</a><br>
<br>
Excerpt:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Just as the British establishment thought it had buried the Lord Greville Janner child abuse story it is coming back to haunt them in the most unexpected ways. For one of Janner’s closest political associates and stoutest defenders has been filmed by a tabloid newspaper hiring young male prostitutes and asking for drugs.<br>
<br>
When the news broke this weekend “family man” and father-of-two Keith Vaz MP immediately owned up and resigned from his prominent position as chairman of the House of Common’s most powerful watchdog committee.<br>
<br>
Vaz was groomed and supported by Lord Janner early in his career. The two were “minority” Labour MPs in neighbouring Leicester constituencies (Vaz’s parents are from India); they were close political allies and thought to have shared many confidences. They were both enthusiasts of mass Muslim immigration and deprecated the Leicester White community’s angry resistance. Vaz became a community leader for Leicester Muslims while Janner became the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews — the most prominent position in the Anglo-Jewry community.</div></blockquote></div>

11 July , 2006<br>
<br>
Alan Senitt, a political campaigner from London and former aide to the vice-president of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), Lord Janner of Braunstone, has been stabbed to death in the US capital Washington. Police said that Senitt, 27, was trying to protect his female companion when they were targeted by armed robbers as they walked home in the early hours of Sunday. The former chairman of the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), had moved from Britain to the US to work on Governor Mark Warner's presidential campaign. Two men, a youth and a woman, have been charged with murder. A police spokesman told the BBC News website: "The suspects demanded money and property. Then one of the suspects attempted to sexually assault the female."<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Jewish_Congress" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Jewish_Congress</a>&nbsp;<br>
The World Jewish Congress (WJC) was founded in Geneva, Switzerland, in August 1936 as an international federation of Jewish communities and organizations. According to its mission statement,[1] the World Jewish Congress' main purpose is to act as "the diplomatic arm of the Jewish people." Membership in the WJC is open to all representative Jewish groups or communities, irrespective of the social, political or economic ideology of the community's host country. The World Jewish Congress headquarters are in New York City, US, and the organization maintains international offices in Brussels, Belgium; Jerusalem, Israel; Paris, France; Moscow, Russia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Geneva, Switzerland. The WJC has special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.&nbsp;</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>LEADERS and key funders of World Jewish Relief enjoyed an intimate kosher afternoon tea with the Prince of Wales at Clarence House on Wednesday to celebrate the Prince’s role in its Ukrainian livelihood development programme...<br>
<br>
Prince Charles is a patron of the Ukrainian programme, helping Jews in poverty to develop the skills needed to get into work. It also starts job centres and provides access to child-care.<br>
<br>
A long-time supporter of the charity, he opened the WJR-funded Jewish Community Centre in Krakow in 2008. Arriving at the reception, the Prince was greeted by WJR chair James Libson, former chair Nigel Layton and chief executive Paul Anticoni. Mr Libson thanked the royal for his “steadfast support of our community”...<br>
<br>
Mr Layton said Prince Charles was keen to know “if the projects were working well, whether we were getting people into work. He likes to be kept informed.” WJR trustee Linda Rosenblatt added: “The Prince knew a number of people here personally. He asked after their families, their work. He was extremely engaged and good at stimulating conversation.”<br>
<br>
Her husband Harvey, chair of Nightingale, reminisced with the Prince about his visit to the south London home to open a dementia wing.<br>
<br>
Guests included Express newspaper boss <span style="color:#FF0040">Richard Desmond</span> and representatives from the Maurice and Vivienne Wohl Foundation, which backs the programme in the Ukraine...<br>
<br>
Prince Charles also chatted to Sir Maurice and Lady Irene Hatter, supporters of WJR and World Ort. Lady Hatter said: “He asked us how often we visit the projects in Eastern Europe and we told him about an Ort school we are hoping to open in six months
