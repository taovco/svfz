			<div class="content">This is really been bothering me.  Weighing heavy on my mind.  Here where I found info from Twitter : <br>
<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Allenma15086871/status/1343829718186008576" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/Allenma15086871/sta ... 8186008576</a><br>
<br>
The page consists of short video clips by "Scotty Films", but there is one in particular that caught my eye from December 30th (direct link posted above). Watch it and you tell me what you think.  I did a little bit of research already on him and I've got who he is.   We have all heard of only a few of them and surely all have watched the movie, "13 hours," but here is someone who appears out of the blue in a short, vague video, which is what I meant by saying"Good" if indeed he is alive and he appears aged and weathered and what I meant by saying "Bad."  Understandably so, of course, if his memory was wiped out.  I've heard that the family is raw to have others speak of their family member being alive, but at the same time, I want to think that this Twitter profile IS his younger brother since his younger brothers name is Scott.  Of course, I could be all off.  Who knows.  <br>
<br>
Give a watch. Tell me if you know anything more about this and then I'll come back with more.  <br>
Now, I'm the one being elusive...sorry.  Just such an honorable and sensitive subject for us all and would prefer to tread lightly, that's all.<br>
Let me know what you think.</div>

			<div class="content">The thing with the curl makes me think it could be Q, which if he's really alive makes sense of the story that he was rescued by the NSA, not many people can do nothing as a job. Also it seems like the family stopped posting on the memorial site after a few years, they may have forgot about it after finding out he was alive. And assuming they knew he would be in danger if they revealed anything... they would be shy to talk to anyone about him at all. BUT I can see the resemblance and still think it might not be him, plus they can deep fake stuff, so I'm not sure. Frankly if he's alive and the whole of seal team 6 is alive then maybe the whole crash story is BS to protect the team from terrorists (or terrorists working for Obama), and if he's dead, then maybe someone with big money would want to dishonor the memory of an American hero by faking a video, or maybe just some guy who happens to look similar.</div>

			<div class="content">First was thrown off, like many, since the first video had another Seal that looked a lot like him and then a 2nd vid came up with the same person with the big curly Q, but different photos.  The two men have a resemblance in thier earlier years and people argued back and forth between him being one of the two, either Tumilson as in the first video for which he did have a good resemblance, but then in the second video, it became uncanny that was a true match which is Aaron Vaughn.  So, are both men alive?  Both gone? Are all of them alive? Did Extortion 17 really even crash as you mentioned? or was it salvageble? or were they even on it? Was there another heli?  Is the video some made up CGI video recreation or whatever you call it?  <br>
<br>
Seems now that a few of those old Q posts mean something different.  Meaning the post "You will never be alone. We are all UNITED. Godspeed, Patriots" was what was sent to the Seals as they were left out there.  It is said that spec ops never have their geo ID'd, but that Biden gave them away.  That said, was that heli the real Extortion 17 or a target.  You could have a point since these soldiers had earned their Q clearance. And the Q post did say that about who has been doing to Q talking.  But really would like to see this long movie start wrapping up and hoping it will have an adventurous, spectacular ending.  Not looking for one of those Stephen King type endings that is for sure.  <br>
<br>
A lot to think about just on those few bits of information.  And now we have a freaking Viking show up out of the blue!  <br>
<br>
In the medical field in the Emergency Room, it's never commented when it gets quite since that is considered a jinx and it suddenly becomes busy.  So I won't say anything like, "What's Next."</div>
