			<div class="content">Call me nuts and would not doubt many say the same these crazy days with what we are seeing each day.  And it is getting worse with each passing day.  So be it, looks like the show is about to begin very soon.  So I figure why not post some ideas here and see what others think.  Figure it is the Conspiracy Sub, so why not.  Here goes:<br>
<br>
Mind that these are not all my own ideas and cannot take credit for them, but have tried to tie these ideas together.  So much information flying by that there are things read/heard here and there and can't remember where.  We already know some of the strange basics that have been going on as in Kamala never gave up her Senate seat, Biden campaign acknowledged they would get their Pres-elect funding, yet never used it and also heard that security briefs were taken away, and Biden canceled the parade and the inauguration is semi-virtual.  There's even more....etc., etc., etc.<br>
<br>
I want to say this info is from something Q posted which is the installation/positioning of the razor wire<br>
(yes, I'm too lazy to go searching bc I have a lot to type here right now and have an appointment to make soon), but it is in regards to the razor wire fencing around the Capital:<br>
<br>
1.  Concertina Razor Wire has been installed up top of a non-scalable 8' tall fence around the entire capital center.  Note the razor wire has been placed to the outside of the fence, preventing entry up and over the fence into the Capital area.  In other words, Keeping people out and leaving those inside locked in.<br>
<br>
Here is the correct way to install Concertina wire atop of a fence and for desired functionality:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.razorwiresupplier.com/installation/install-of-razor-wire.html" class="postlink">https://www.razorwiresupplier.com/insta ... -wire.html</a><br>
<br>
The third picture down in this article shows a good view of the coiled wire located top and outside:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.radio.com/1010wins/news/politics/13-photos-dc-prepares-for-inauguration" class="postlink">https://www.radio.com/1010wins/news/pol ... auguration</a><br>
<br>
<br>
2.  Just the banner of the Welcome signs for Pres and Madam VP, something very cheesy and not right about it:<br>
<br>
From the same page of the same article here again, but the first picture see the two large banners:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.radio.com/1010wins/news/politics/13-photos-dc-prepares-for-inauguration" class="postlink">https://www.radio.com/1010wins/news/pol ... auguration</a><br>
<br>
<br>
3.  Mar Largo - The Winter White House:<br>
<br>
P.DJT called it this back in '17:    <br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/01/trump-dubs-mar-a-lago-the-new-winter-white-house-108841" class="postlink">https://www.politico.com/states/florida ... use-108841</a><br>
<br>
And it had construction performed in November '20:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/us/trump-is-renovating-mar-a-lago-ostensibly-preparing-for-life-post-presidency.html" class="postlink">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/us/t ... dency.html</a><br>
<br>
This article states that if he chose to stay to live, that he would have to remove the heliport and would most likely lose the country club's license and then it would not generate any income.  But if this is the new White House, would think the heliport stays and the license would be gone since as President, he is not to be generating income anywhere else.  So actually this makes sense.<br>
<br>
<br>
4.  Tom Hanks is hosting the Inauguration.  Enough said right there and also many of the A class celebs and music industries finest will be there too. <br>
 Again, makes sense.  Round 'em all up at once.<br>
<br>
5.  The communications tower is heavily guarded by the National Guard (refer back to the first article #1 where it is pictured) and find it a little bit odd that this is noted at all.  True, it should have security, but then again, the NG for the communications tower?  Isn't this the MSM's area?   That thing does not look commercial though, but I wouldn't know for sure.  Something to think further about.<br>
<br>
6.  It is also noted in the article (refer to #1) that stores are stocked with souvenirs.  Wasn't it stated that all shops have been closed?  Perhaps side venders, yes.  Perhaps the souvenirs might be worth something someday for those able to get some. <br>
<br>
7.  The article (same one again, which is why I chose it for easy reference) states that there was to have been an inaugural parade near the WH, but as we know, Biden canceled it.  That said, we never got our patriots parade with our military that was canceled several years back.  Want to say if recalling correctly 11/11/17 or 18??  It never happened.  Will this be when it does happen.  It would certainly be convenient with so many of our military already present or will it be something else?  How do we even know for sure there will be riots there?  For what we know, there could be overjoyed happiness by many and even many on the left (Democrats, non-antifa people). <br>
<br>
8.  Lastly, until I most likely think of more to add in later on, Donald Trump is a real and true showman with plenty of glitz to bring out for the show of the Century and one for the record books....Uh, I mean Blockchain.  <br>
<br>
How say you Conspiracy Frens?  Did I just make two cups of coffee and sit here for nothing?????</div>

			<div class="content">My guess,they're planning to "assassinate" Biden. This removes Biden and clears the way for Kamala,who will show she's a "strong independent woman" by "stepping into the highest office during our greatest crisis". It will show how "dangerous" the far right nazis are because they can get past all that security and kill the president,so no one is really safe. They may even "kill" some "beloved celebrities" who are past their usefulness.<br>
<br>
This along side the state capital "riots/coup attempts" the FBI has scheduled will be the controlled "show of force" the jews need to convince people "the nazis are back and we need to stop them for good this time!" They'll use this to round up white people,most of whom will go quietly because "I'm not a nazi,so I don't have anything to be afraid of",and ship them off to gulags for extermination/reeducation.<br>
<br>
In the end,it's soviet Russia all over again. Enjoy the ride.</div>
