<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">At plus eighteen hrs around 9:30 pm on the evening of November 23, 1963, Australian radio played a tape recording of the JFK assassination wherein Mrs Kennedy's voice was clearly heard calling "hello Coretta" followed by a volley of gunfire.</strong><br>
<br>
The presenter explained Coretta was the wife of one Reverend Martin Luther King, he played a slowed down version of the tape and asked listeners how many shots they could hear, he said he counted about nineteen his studio guest said she counted twenty two.<br>
<br>
That was the only time the Luther Kings were associated with the crime until whispers were heard at the time of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago .. although he was feted and fabulized by the same ppl who propounded the LHO lone assassin scenario there was no money the black ---- was broke.<br>
<br>
He went to the source had roped him into the conspiracy in the first place read George HW Bush, and asked for dough to be told there was none, so he chanced his arm at blackmail presumably assuring GHWB if he was not paid everyone would get to hear about what went on in Dallas .. he laughed him off.<br>
<br>
Where after some short time later on April 4, 1968 Luther King was shot dead by sniper fire while standing talking on the telephone on a hotel balcony in Memphis, we will say GHW Bush shot him for attempted blackmail.<br>
<br>
That in reprisal LK's antecedents took time out at the August 1968 DNC to drop the bombshell of his and Coretta's involvement, and that the ultra police violence blamed on Chicago Mayor <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/violence-rocks-1968-democratic-convention-video" class="postlink">Richard Daley</a> that marred the event was to smokescreen the Dallas material.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Haynes says Seal introduced him to a politician drug dealer from Arkansas - William Jefferson Clinton - who in 1984 asked him to kill David Kennedy, son and nephew of Senator Robert and President John Kennedy .. DK was in Florida attending a family celebration and was staying at the Brazilian Court Hotel &amp; Beach Club in Palm Beach.<br>
<br>
He was found dead there April 25, 1984 allegedly from a drug overdose after staff checked his welfare allegedly at the insistence of family members, another Kennedy brother had been staying in the same hotel and had checked out prior to the body being found .. we know most often ppl get murdered either by friends or by family members.<br>
<br>
That being said a diligent investigator would immediately assume DK's family wanted him dead for whatever reason, to which end the other brother introduced him to BJH who had accepted the contract to kill him, that it was he who had requested hotel staff to check his welfare.<br>
<br>
The same prosecutor would suppose Clinton must be the man the upper classes got in touch with if they wanted someone dead, that he could arrange it all upon payment of a suitable fee. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/04/28/david-kennedy-the-mystery/18bbc62e-48c5-43c4-951c-a5aebf3963dd/" class="postlink">David Kennedy's Death</a>.</div></blockquote>
