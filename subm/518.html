<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I met Dennis Andrew Nilsen in Brisbane Australia in 1973 .. after walking home from work at the Evans Deaken Shipyard at Kangaroo Point, I got to the Brunswick Hotel in the Brisbane suburb of New Farm at around 4:20 that afternoon, the pub was fairly crowded, there were some ppl I knew including an Englishman from London who had done a bit of time.<br>
<br>
He was in company with DAN who he introed as a former London policeman, I said "you were a Bobby then" and asked if they had known each other in Blighty, they said they had not. I had seen video interviews and photos of Dennis Andrew Nilsen over a period of yrs without ever recognizing him, until I realized he was the man in a YouTube thumbnail.</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YSwbkHB9/DAN-17.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He looked to be aged about halfway between the clean shaven, dark eyed dichotomization shot taken during his military service, and the <a href="https://murderpedia.org/male.N/n/nilsen-dennis.htm" class="postlink">Murderpedia</a> shot shows him in a collar and tie. He told me he had served in the British Army in Aden and said he was into underground gladiatorial contests, whether as an observer or as a participant he never made clear .. he was a fairly big strong boned type and gave the impression escaping his clutches would be difficult.<br>
<br>
I did not much like the way he looked at me as though I were a slab of meat, and because of that and because of the shady rep of his companion I departed the pub a short time later, I guess the period was after Nilson left the Metropolitan Police in 1973 and before he took up employment with the Civil Service in 1974. The person he was with in the pub was a below average height fellow named Peter who was working as a painter.<br>
<br>
I had met him a few times before, he was a fairly good humored type who said he had a hard time in prison because of his English accent, which to the other crims sounded like the screws who were mostly Englishmen. The day he was with Nilson was a Friday, when I went back into the pub the following Tuesday he was there on his own, when I suggested he join me he was rude.<br>
<br>
I had intended to advise caution with whom he kept company .. I drank my drink and got out of the place like I had on the previous occasion, I never saw him again. Thursday two days on came a television news report a man's body had been found in his New Farm flat, I immediately thought of Peter the rude English painter, as well I surmised he had become a victim of his friend Dennis Nilson.<br>
<br>
The next day's bulletin quoted the police report, that concluded since there were no signs of forced entry and no suspicious marks on the deceased's body it was a natural death.</div></blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The day I met Dennis Nilson in the pub he came right up close. I knew he was an ex London Policeman he looked very strong and his profile suggested he was gonna place me in a policeman's arm lock, which is a wrestling move that can quickly be turned into a sleeper hold, which will cause death if held for long enough by an experienced assailant, suppose he killed his man in Brisbane in 1973 and the rest of his victims by the same method.<br>
<br>
After running into Peter the Painter in the pub on the Tuesday afternoon following meeting Nilsen in his company the Friday before, sometime around 6:20 am the following Wednesday morning when I left the digs I was in at the lower end of the New Farm peninsular in Brisbane there was a bus coming. Since the fare to where I had to get off then walk across the Story Bridge to work at the Evans Deaken shipyard was only 10 cents I went aboard.<br>
<br>
Despite it was the wrong bus which went the long way 'round, thus very shortly I realized I could have walked the distance as usually did in less time .. no matter. When the bus turned back onto Brunswick Street and proceeded to the next stop outside the NF Police Station looking out the front window of the bus, I saw DAN walk out from Terrace Street where PtP lived and head across Brunswick Street to the next bus stop near the pub.<br>
<br>
I was in the standing section of the bus which was by then almost full .. DAN got on at the bus stop and proceeded to the same standing section of the bus .. he recognized me and I asked him if "he had stayed at Peter's place" he said "no," I said "did you get a flat up there" he said no to that as well .. that Peter's body had been discovered inside his Terrace Street flat was on the evening news the next day.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>According to pub scuttlebutt his neighbors knew Nilsen had been visiting and was present in the flat with him on the Tuesday night, they heard a quantity of thumping and banging and were aware Nilsen had left the flat alone on the Wednesday morning, and that there had been only silence since, it was they who notified the police who entered the flat and found the body. <strong class="text-strong">Queensland has a long history of stymied police investigations they let him get away with it, the ppl in the district were up in arms when Nilson was not arrested!</strong></div></blockquote>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYrEC12W0G8" class="postlink">Israel Keyes</a>.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dennis Andrew Nilsen is not the only one I recognized off of a YT thumbnail, in Nimbin, New South Wales in about 2009 I purchased some marijuana from a fellow who introed himself as Israel Keyes, the bag I bought at cost had a stone in it to make up the weight, the day I met him he looked exactly as he does in the YT thumbnail, he is thought responsible for as many as eleven murders in the US.<br>
<br>
Israel Keyes fits the bill for a double murder at an isolated farmhouse in Northern NSW at around the same time, when I contacted the Murwillumbah CIB in about 2014 the detective I spoke to had never heard of him or the double murder .. he committed suicide in prison December 2012 in Anchorage, Alaska. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/alaska-serial-killer-israel-keyes-committed-suicide-hidden/story?id=17883891" class="postlink">Link</a>. </div></blockquote>
