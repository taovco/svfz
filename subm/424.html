			<div class="content">As the sun sets on the world, as the White race fades and world is consumed by the monsters from beyond the sands and seas we start to slowly lose our sanity in the face of the oblivion that awaits us, as if Cthulu itself was here.<br>
<br>
I know many people have hope in the future, hope that we can beat the federal government and win the coming war for our survival, but I see no plausible way we can.  It's not due to our division, it's not due to our impotence and lack of will to fight, it's due to what we truly face.  We face an enemy which can subvert and destroy all of our efforts from within (Operation Gladio and the years of Lead), an enemy with near complete control over the minds of the masses (Project blue beam, anti-White egalitarian Marxist propaganda, etc.) and which has nearly unlimited military resources.  Before, when I first came to Voat (under the name 1488HeilPierce), I had hope, hope that was misplaced, but hope I needed to stay sane, I advocated full scale nuclear war and terrorism as I believed that because the masses would never awaken from their slumber that it was the only way to survive.  <br>
<br>
What I failed to take into account at the time, what I refused to believe or consider was the fact that it won't work, not only is there no way to organize such an operation against the federal government but it wouldn't work.  A lot of people here underestimate the power of the Zionist government, they underestimate not only their control over the masses and their ability to infiltrate our organizations, but also their technology, just how outmatched we really are.  How can you possibly hope to win against a government that has Tanks, drone swarms (technology which has already changed the face of warfare forever), aircraft, missiles that can target your location and kill you, space lasers that can destroy any nuclear missiles you launch and technology we can only begin to imagine (TR-3B).  It is to the point where unless we find a virus/pathogen that can wipe out most of humanity (or better, an ethnic bio weapon) we are completely doomed, and even if we were able to find that there is no reason to believe that the government would not stop it's spread and stop us, as remember, they have infiltrated all our organizations, we saw how this ends in Japan already, the Aleph cult was raided and destroyed before they could really make any real impact, the Zionists have very likely improved their methods of detecting and eliminating potential threads since then significantly.  <br>
<br>
People like to pretend that we can beat such a force with AR-15s and manpower but the truth is that we can't, and any honestly person knows that, people like to pretend as though committing terrorist acts will lead to civilizations collapse (if they don't pretend it's somehow inevitable) but this too is unrealistic, do conservatives fight back because a White Nationalist bombs their White town? Of course not. Do niggers and shitlibs fight back if we cut power to their cities? No, of course not, the niggers and shitlibs burn down the city, riot, loot, rape and murder while the White liberals cower in fear, too stupid and disorganized to leave their cities and threaten the conservative masses.  What would this even accomplish? What would even happen as a result of this? If no one fights back then what? The government cracks down on terrorism and starts implementing more red flag gun laws until they eventually ban all guns? Will the people fight back? Did they when they banned machine guns in 1986? I don't believe so unfortunately, and even if they did fight back what would it accomplish? Zionists taking control of the resistance, subverting and destroying the resistance like they have for centuries... Give people false hope in controlled opposition just like with Donald Trump and Q-anon.<br>
<br>
What is the end results of this impossible fight we face? Can we hope to achieve victory under such conditions? Yes, but not victory as most imagine it, does anyone remember the Spartans that gave their lives at Thermopylae as losers or do they remember them as heroes? We achieve victory through fighting back, protecting our people, our families and our communities for as long as we can, when the hordes of darkness (niggers/shitskins) come in we must flee and when we can flee no more, when the sun finally fades behind the last clouds, we must end our lives and those of our family and people to protect them from the fate that those that "survive" face.  Our people will face a fate worse than extinction, there is nothing we can really do to stop this other than to cause as much damage as possible... Perhaps we can achieve victory and I am wrong, but I fear that I am not wrong given the information I have, I hope I am wrong though.<br>
<br>
We are like a child lost in the woods as the sun sets on the world forever and the world fades into darkness around us, we hear the wolves and monsters approaching, as we run through the woods looking for a well lit cabin or for the sun to rise again (which it never will) we hear the monsters approach and all we can do is keep running, eventually we have run so long and so far that we begin to see things in the trees and in the distance, we see a well lit cabin, we see light over the horizon but when we reach it... it was nothing, it was our mind playing tricks on us, eventually we grow tired and our body begins to break down, eventually we reach the edges of the world itself, and with our back of the wall of the world the wolves and monsters approach, hopelessly outmatched we take the dagger and end our lives and those we love...</div>
