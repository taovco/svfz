			<div class="content">Potus said: Go home in Peace. (sounds biblical? Go into your inner rooms for a moment until the day of wrath has passed)<br>
<br>
What would we do if he had said: Kill all enemies? <br>
<br>
How ferocious would we keep our oath? The go home part I think will be doable, how about peace? <br>
<br>
Did you hear Pelosi, urging Pence to invoke the 25th? She now thinks she can get away with impeachment should that not be feasible. <br>
<br>
They are now at the cups of their power. This would be the completion of the treason. <br>
<br>
Case 1. 25th. <br>
<br>
Pence and the majority of department head must send a letter to the President pro tempore of the Senate and to the speaker of the house the President's inability to execute his office. Thereupon Trump can write, no such inability exist. Then Pence and his plotters need to write the same accusation again, meanwhile Pence becomes acting President, until such time,  by two-thirds vote of both Houses, it is determined that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.<br>
<br>
Given the timing, the 20-iest is only 12 ways away. <br>
<br>
The question is if Pence is willing to execute such a plot, founded on the premise of no concession.  (this is the Dem's Antifa plot)<br>
<br>
By the same token they can go for articles of impeachment. These will be executed switftly. Especially, while thinking, because many senators have rejected the contest of de EC votes, they might have a majority to push it through the senate. <br>
<br>
Here's the deal. By graft, they pushed their candidate for President. Then they execute the same plan in the senatorial race in GA. And by putting their hand on the scale, they think they can make it legal to defraud the US, and commit treason against the US. <br>
<br>
Technically, it could be done in a day, this one, and for optics, maybe 2 days. <br>
<br>
It would feel as if there's no way out. The wagons are in a circle. The bad guys encircle the homesteaders. <br>
The pressure on patriots will increase. Truly a time to be geared up with the mental integrity components of our spiritual battledress. The precipice. <br>
<br>
It would require a strong response, so it seems. <br>
<br>
But what if .... and bear with me here. It will be a weird reaching speculation. <br>
<br>
<br>
.... What if.....<br>
<br>
<br>
What if  Trump already resigned? Huh? Yes .... what if he already resigned? <br>
<br>
Let's entertain this though in our mind. Logically, there would be NO 25th or Impeachment. Right? <br>
<br>
Why would he? Well, of what exactly is President Trump President? UNITED STATES OF AMERICA inc. .....is he? What if he has been?  <br>
What if a the USA INC is beyond bankrupt? Beyond Salvage? Totally done.<br>
<br>
And the organic Federal Republic of the United States of America is resurrected?  <br>
<br>
With companies in chapter 11 we kind a find it logical that such a company is simply liquidated. <br>
<br>
What if, a New Republic is instituted? Weird? Not that weird. The French are already enjoying their fourth Republic. The Romans their Fourth Reich. And the Romans had two republics. The Dutch had three. It happens more often than one might think. Although, I kinda like the resurrection of the organic US. <br>
<br>
That would need a transfer of assets, would it not. Especially military? New elections, a renewed compact. It would solve so many issues. What is DC? You get where I am getting at? It would also presuppose a transfer of people. From bondage to freedom. <br>
<br>
My God, it would bring down the whole corrupt Temple down upon him. Indeed Trump the last President of the INC. <br>
Wait a moment! ....  Can you see the consequences? <br>
<br>
All international treaties gone.  The two china policy (why do you think China is preparing for war?). Taiwan would be the one and only legal representative of the Chinese People. It would end NATO. It would shock the Europeans to the core. Merkel is running for the loo but is too late ... that sort of images. <br>
<br>
It would totally bring down the House. Hence, also the P. EBS.<br>
It would totally destroy everything.<br>
Yes, totally bankrupt. The FRN immediately loses value in such a scenario. The Euro will take a hit, the Yuan goes into the toilet. That would be a reset, but not a one they, the globalist DS,  want. <br>
<br>
You got enough food and water at home? Enough lead and silver/gold? That would go through the roof!<br>
<br>
Who will be the New Administration? What did Potus say? He would the new admin, would he not? <br>
<br>
Pelosi, Schumer, Swallwell, all the traitors, trapped in an alien jurisdiction...not protected by the Original Constitution, already enemies of the State. Already, an insurrection of foreigners. Ready for pickup. Ready for Gitmo. <br>
<br>
Hence, the Mil is the only way. Swift and clean. <br>
<br>
<br>
Update: Potus just spoke. He said he was honored to have been President. But nowhere does he concede. He does not even mention Biden at all. All of a sudden, It sounds like my re-activation scenario was not that outlandisch. <br>
<br>
Hold the Line, whatever!<br>
