			<div class="content">Right now the anti-COVID vax people in the UK are being corralled by some carefully placed social media 'influencers' who are running a psyop for the 'woo woo' globalist crowd. Let me explain...<br>
<br>
I don't go on Twitter much these days but a tweet from Anna Brees (who describes herself as ex-BBC) caught my eye: <a href="https://twitter.com/BreesAnna/status/1394558398650273795" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/BreesAnna/status/13 ... 8650273795</a><br>

MARK WESTALL INTERVIEW: SAMIR CERIC FOUNDER AND CEO DEBUT CONTEMPORARY <a href="https://fadmagazine.com/2013/03/18/mark-westall-interview-samir-ceric-founder-and-ceo-debut-contemporary/" class="postlink">https://fadmagazine.com/2013/03/18/mark ... temporary/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>18 March 2013<br>
<br>
Another one off FAD’s occasional interviews with people leading companies that are changing the very fabric of the art world , up now is Samir Ceric CEO and Founder of Debut Contemporary.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">1 Samir who are you and what have you done in the past ?</span><br>
<br>
I would like to think of myself as a serial entrepreneur with social enterprise ethos and philosophy. I feel I have done a variety of things, from <span style="color:#FF0040">volunteering in a Bosnian refugee camp, working with the British Foreign Office and The Ministry of Defence, I was appointed CEO of a national airline at the age of 29</span>, set up telecom and insurance businesses and then ventured into the art industry almost 10 years ago.<br>
<br>
I recently co-founded an award winning fashion business with my wife and my collectors, Wolf &amp; Badger, which led to us winning a Walpole Brand of Tomorrow, highlighting us “as one of the future business leaders in the global fashion industry”. Having exited the business at the point of the business archiving a multi-million pound valuation by raising close to £1miilion inside the 18 months of its launch, I then co-founded Debut Contemporary with my wife Zoe Knight, a renowned fashion designer.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">2 What is Debut Contemporary ?</span><br>
<br>
Debut Contemporary is the only professional development platform in the art industry designed to help artists turn their creative practice into a viable business. It’s been labelled as the business academy of the art world where we assist artists in identifying commercial and creative opportunities as well as teaching them how art derivatives could assist one’s career both in terms of additional revenue streams as well as critical acclaim. Artists are taught PR and marketing and social media strategies, copyrights and IPRs, artist resale rights, accountancy, business planning, as well as how best to approach galleries, curators, collectors and art critics, and from long term relationships that will serve them for a long time. The platform acts as an incubator of creative start-ups and prepares artists to become an investable art business.....<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">8 Has been being successful in the fashion industry helped you in the art world ? have you found many differences ?</span><br>
<br>
Indeed. The business model and the concept we piloted in the fashion world, we pretty much replicated in the art world. There are a lot more similarities than differences between art and fashion, to be perfectly honest. I run something called ‘Creative Business Surgery’ at the Electric House on a monthly basis as we have a very close working relationship and <span style="color:#FF0040">partnership with the Soho House group </span>where I also give talks on creative entrepreneurship and invite other successful entrepreneurs to do ‘In Conversation With’ me talks. The next one is scheduled to be with Peter Tullin of Culture Label on 19th March 2013. That’s where I come across many creative entrepreneurs from fashion, art, design and other creative disciplines and it always amazes me how similar these businesses actually are on all levels of business modelling and scalability.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Eric Clapton wrote a letter detailing his "dire" reactions to the coronavirus vaccine - blaming what he called "propaganda" that promoted the safety of the vaccine.<br>
<br>
Clapton detailed his experience in a letter to Robin Monotti Graziadei, an Italian architect and film producer with a history of going after the Covid-19 vaccine - calling his reactions "disastrous".<br>
<br>
"In February of this year, before I learned the nature of vaccines, (and being 76 with ephezyma [sic]) I was at the forefront," he wrote in the letter, which has been shared on Telegram and verified by Rolling Stone . “I took the first shot of [the AstraZeneca vaccine] and immediately had a severe reaction that lasted ten days, I finally recovered and was told it would take twelve weeks before the second.<br>
<br>
He continued to detail his reactions, saying that "his hands and feet were either frozen, numb or hot, and pretty much useless for two weeks."<br>
<br>
"I was worried that I would never play again," he wrote, citing his peripheral neuropathic disorder and adding, "But the propaganda said the vaccine was safe for everyone."<br>
<br>
Common side effects of AstraZeneca vaccine include general flu-like symptoms, "generally feeling unwell", "joint or muscle pain" and other less common symptoms such as "abdominal pain" and "enlarged lymph nodes" .</div></blockquote></div>
