Looking through our archive we never really did a deep dive on Chieco and I have a theory about who she is.. but first, this thread is going on a long, meandering journey...<br>
<br>
In 2004, she donated to John Kerry's bid for president <a href="https://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/catherine-chieco.asp?cycle=04" class="postlink">https://www.campaignmoney.com/political ... p?cycle=04</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A freelance writer and consultant with extensive nonprofit experience, Catherine continues to be involved in helping with CCIJ’s larger organizational strategy.<br>
<br>
She has graduate degrees from Columbia University in social work, where she was selected for an internship at the Columbia University Business School’s Institute for Non-Profit Management, and journalism, where she received a Newsday Jaqueline Radin Award for Promising Women Journalists.<br>
<br>
Originally from New York City, she directed an alternative to incarceration program for the Legal Aid Society, worked as a special assistant to the Deputy Mayor for Criminal Justice, and as a program officer with The New World Foundation, The New York Community Trust, and the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Aaron Diamond Foundation</span>. As a program officer, her areas of philanthropy included: peace and disarmament, public education, arts and culture, youth and children’s services, as well as a portfolio funding advocacy, healthcare and community organizing in the coal communities of Kentucky and West Virginia.  While at these foundations she also maintained a freelance writing and consultant practice, which she continued after moving to Washington, DC in 1991. Clinical work included counseling with pre-adolescents at Children’s Village, a residential foster care facility in Dobbs Ferry, New York, and with incarcerated youth and their families.<br>
<br>
She is the primary author on three major studies: a nationwide survey of community groups for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development titled: Initiatives for Community Self-Help: Efforts to Increase Recognition and Support, and a report: Mission Possible: 200 Ways to Strengthen the Nonprofit Sector’s Infrastructure for the Union Institute’s Office of Social Responsibility, as well as a 1989 study entitled: AIDS, Community Needs and Private Funding: A Needs Assessment for New York City commissioned by The New York City Aids Fund.<br>
<br>
In the past several years she has worked as a Middle and Upper School counselor at Washington Latin Public Charter School, and as an expository writing consultant for the St. Albans school.  She is also a potter whose work has sold at the gift shops at the Phillips Gallery and the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Past and current board memberships include the American Initiative for Italian Culture, Appalshop, The American Forum, and the Educational Video Center.</div></blockquote>

There's a lot to unpick in that..I'll start with the Aaron Diamond Foundation.. at this point the story will divert away from Chieco but I'll get back to her later in the comments..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In all the furore prompted by Joe Hockey's comments on house ownership, the casual assumption is that the Hockey family fortune is the Treasurer's. That's insulting to the architect, designer and majority owner of their property portfolio, his wife, Melissa Babbage... Ms Babbage, an ambitious and successful investment banker with a 20-year career at Deutsche Bank behind her, is the author - and owner - of the "Hockey Portfolio".<br>
<br>
It was she who bought the majority share in the Canberra home where rooms were rented out to visiting MPs (including her husband) - a canny investment, seeing as the family home was bought in the late 1990s, when Canberra houses were going for a song owing to the new Howard Government's public service cuts.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Phillips Collection, America’s first museum of modern art, was opened in 1921 in historic Dupont Circle in Washington, DC, by collector and philanthropist Duncan Phillips. Duncan Phillips (1886-1966) was the son of Major Duncan Clinch Phillips, a Pittsburgh businessman and Civil War veteran, and Eliza Laughlin Phillips, whose father was a banker and co-founder of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company. The family moved to Washington, DC, in winter 1895-96.<br>
<br>
...Under the directorship of Dorothy Kosinski since 2008, the Phillips has worked to diversify its collection, exhibitions, programs, and staff, notably hiring a full-time Chief Diversity Officer and expanding its collection and exhibitions to include more contemporary art and more works by women and people of color. The museum launched a major partnership with the University of Maryland in 2015 and opened a satellite campus in Southeast DC at the<span style="color:#FF0040"> Town Hall Education and Recreation Campus (THEARC)</span> in 2018. </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>THEARC houses the Washington Ballet, the Corcoran Gallery (now defunct), Covenant House DC, the Washington School for Girls, Levine School of Music as well as a medical, dental and psychiatric clinic for children.<br>
<br>
A $34 million expansion will see a new facility to be finished this year will also house the John T. Walker School for Boys, the Children's National Health System clinic, the Phillips Collection, the Appletree Institute, and the David Lynch Foundation. It's a prestigious project with a lot of prestige attached...<br>
<br>
On THEARC: "The celebrated Mississippi Avenue SE venue has hosted President Barack Obama twice. Its story was narrated by Gen. Colin Powell. Yoko Ono premiered her "Imagine Peace" exhibit there. NASA hosted its 50th anniversary event there. Doug E. Fresh gave a lesson on health there. It is home to nine nonprofits and a 365-seat community theater, and serves roughly 85,000 individuals annually."<br>
<br>
Now I am not saying there's anything untoward about elite DC social circles sponsoring and supporting facilities for underprivileged children - even if I find the role of this Christopher J. Smith - who not only built and runs the facility through BBAR but also partners it with his WJ Smith Inc - rather dubious. Well I guess he has much bigger fish to fry now anyway.<br>
<br>
However, most if not all of the non-profits involved have numerous intricate ties to the particular circle under investigation in Pizzagate: Alefantis, Maccoby-Folger, Webre, Sigmund etc, as well as the institutions (the Corcoran was founded by a master freemason, <span style="color:#FF0040">Phillips Gallery was run by a CIA operative</span>).
