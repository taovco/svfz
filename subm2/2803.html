<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Rose van Cutsem and Maggie Bolger are, on the face of it, unlikely friends and business partners. Bolger is a matter-of-fact New Zealander who lives in London, while van Cutsem — née Astor — is an Oxfordshire-based aristocrat and close friend of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Her daughter Grace was a bridesmaid at Will and Kate’s wedding — she was the little poppet who put her hands over her ears on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to block out the noise of the fly-past (her brother-in-law William is godfather to Prince George).<br>
<br>
But with seven children between them, they bonded over a shared problem: how to keep their children entertained in a pleasant environment that didn’t sap their own will to live....</div></blockquote>

The rest is behind a paywall but we can continue the story elsewhere.  Maggie and Rose is the nursery that the 2 friends created <a href="https://maggieandrose.com/nurseries/our-nursery/" class="postlink">https://maggieandrose.com/nurseries/our-nursery/</a><br>

The Prime Minister counts one Lord Astor as his (step) father-in-law and the other as a minister in the Ministry of Defence, and the family supplied two bridesmaids at the royal wedding and have among their number an ex of Pippa and a friend of Cara Delevingne.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hugh van Cutsem (21 July 1941 – 2 September 2013) was an English banker, businessman, landowner and horse-breeder...Hugh Bernard Edward van Cutsem was born on 21 July 1941.[1][2][3] His father Bernard van Cutsem (1916–1975) was a millionaire horse-trainer and -breeder.[2][3] His mother was Mary Compton, a descendant of the chiefly line of Clan Farquharson.[2][3] The van Cutsems were Roman Catholics of Flemish origin who had moved to England in the nineteenth century..<br>
<br>
Van Cutsem worked as an investment banker at <span style="color:#FF0040">Hambros Bank</span>.[2] Later he began his own company and purchased further companies, including a data storage company.. Van Cutsem inherited his father's stud Northmore Farm in Exning near Newmarket, Suffolk, in 1976.[2] He also owned a 4,000-acre estate in Norfolk, best known for its private wild game shoots...<br>
<br>
He was a founding member of the Countryside Movement, a non-profit organization which later became the Countryside Alliance, focussed on shooting.<br>
<br>
A devout Roman Catholic, he built a chapel near his Hilborough residence for family occasions, and arranged for priests to visit.[2] However, he also regularly attended Mass at Our Lady of Pity in Swaffham with his family.[2] <span style="color:#FF0040">In 1993, he was appointed a Knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta</span>..<br>
<br>
From the Prince's university days Hugh van Cutsem was a friend of Charles, Prince of Wales.[2] Prince Charles was godfather to his son Edward, who was a pageboy at the Prince's wedding to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981
