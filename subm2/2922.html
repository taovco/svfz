Ben Belzer, the governor’s personal assistant, died in a river tubing accident where absolutely <br>
everyone should be wearing life jackets and absoltely no one was. Why was he not wearing one? <br>
Divers had to enter the river to find his body as he had not surfaced. He was a scholar and an athlete.  <br>
He played baseball, football, basketball and recently had taken up golf.<br>
 Belzer joined the gov’s office as the personal assistant in Feb 2019. He was raised in<br>
 La Crosse, Wi, a graduate of the Univ of Wisconsin-Madison,&amp; previously worked for U.S. <br>
Congressman Ron Kind as an intern and at Blumenfeld &amp; Associates. Did I mention he was an althelete?<br>

<br>
<br>
 Problem Statement: The US General Election in Nov 2020 is an important moment........The State <br>
of Wisconsin, a swing state, needs to effectively increase mail-in ballot registration in order to <br>
safely increase voter turnout during the COVID. As Mrs. Clinton put it, is that, “We should do everything we can<br>
to make it easier for every citizen to vote.”<br>
<br>
Target Group: all Wisconsin residents who are eligible to vote.<br>
<br>
Proposed Solution: The Milwaukee and Madison hubs will collaborate with grassroots orgs, civic leaders <br>
in both cities, and progressive orgs to create a voting web series for all Wisconsin residents. Through <br>
the voting web-series that will be promoted on multiple social media channels and Global Shapers hubs, <br>
we will be able to encourage eligible voters to register and request mail-in ballots so that they can <br>
safely exercise their right to vote.<br>
<br>
Hub Activities:<br>
Promote mail-in ballot requests on social media through the Global Shapers accounts, partnering <br>
platforms, and individual accounts.<br>
So, thry are interfering with the American elections too.<br>
<br>
“Don't forget how we got pedo Tony Evers two years ago. 30k democrat votes in Milwaukee county at 1:30 am.<br>
 I thought this practice was widely known as the Wisconsin shuffle. This tactic was used across the <br>
nation in 2020”.<br>
<br>
<br>
Evers is a freemason. They want God, Jesus, Christ and Christians disappeared. They want your guns. <br>
FREEMASONS TRANSLATED AND CHANGED THE BIBLE. Freemasonary is the worlds largest oldest secret society<br>

<br>
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel detailed disturbing revelations that the Congressman <br>
charged a group of doctors $10,000 for a meeting. The purpose of the meeting, was to address<br>
 concerns the doctors had about a health care bill.<br>
Another surgeon statee, that "an unnamed Kind aide" explained that the veteran politician "typically<br>
 requires a contribution of 10k for a 1-2 hour meeting and 25k for a half day."  Pay to Play<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
why did Ben leave these two employers? Did he find more info? Why does Evers practice freemasonry?<br>
