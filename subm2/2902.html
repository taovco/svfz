Stout, glad-handed Park Commissioner John B. Vesey of Memphis, wanted his city to have 1) the largest zoo in the U.S., 2) an eye-catching art collection. With the zoo the Commissioner was doing splendidly. But last week his art boom had the mange. He had spent some $25,000 in good taxpayers' cash for "old masters." There were some 38 paintings, all from the collection of Warner S. McCall, retired St. Louis public-utilities developer, a man who was wont to tread on rare Tabriz rugs and drink from cut glass goblets said to have been fingered by mad King Ludwig of Bavaria. Some of McCall's paintings bore such signatures as Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck, Sir Thomas Gainsborough. But certain Memphis newsmen were not impressed. They called on fastidious Dr. Wilhelm Reinhold Valentiner, Director of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Valentiner's thudding opinion: the City of Memphis had been stung.<br>
<br>
Park Commissioner Vesey did not take this lying on the grass. Ripped he: "If we had the opportunity to make the same purchase tomorrow, I would certainly do it." The controversy gathered momentum, spilled over into local editorial columns (under such puzzling title-lines as "Art, or Beauty, or Both?"). Dr. Valentiner thought a Rubens in the collection, "all right, but not very interesting," worth $6,000 to $8,000. To John B. Vesey the Rubens was tremendously interesting and worth at least $25,000. Besides, it was "valuable because it was painted in Italy, with Italian costuming."<br>
<br>
At week's end Memphis politicians and art lovers kept watching their daily papers.

Harold Lloyd, 33rd Degree - Famous Comedian, Film Producer, and Freemason <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/harold_lloyd_masonic_bio.htm" class="postlink">http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmu ... ic_bio.htm</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The famous American silent film star Harold Clayton Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893, to an itinerant family in Burchard, Nebraska. It was the year after the first American automobile was made and the same year that Thomas A. Edison produced the kinetoscope, which made possible the making of motion pictures... He first appeared in a few not-so-well-known movies in 1915, but by 1917 he had progressed in the industry to the extent that he had already created the glasses-and-straw-hat character, which would ultimately make him famous. <br>
<br>
..This was "The Golden Age of Comedy" for silent films, and Lloyd became one of the great film actors and producers of the time. For over two decades, he was at the forefront of producing movie classics, over 250, many of which remain popular today. By the time he was 31, he was a millionaire and the owner of his own movie studio distributing his films around the world. By 1927, he had become one of the wealthiest entertainers in the country, due not only to the success of his productions but also to his shrewd ability to invest wisely. Wealthier than Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin. or Gloria Swanson, he bought 20 acres in Beverly Hills and built Green Acres, a mansion that came close to exceeding the San Simeon estate of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper tycoon.<br>
<br>
...He was initiated in Alexander Hamilton Lodge No. 535 of Hollywood in 1925 at the height of his movie career. After his Third Degree, with his usual thoroughness and energy, he proceeded through both the York and Scottish Rites, and then joined Al Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles. He took his Royal Arch Degree with his father. In 1926, he became a 32° Scottish Rite Mason in the Valley of Los Angeles, California. In recognition of his services to the nation and Freemasonry, Bro. Lloyd was invested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honour in 1955 and coroneted an Inspector General Honorary, 33°, in 1965. As his movie work began to decline, he replaced it with ever-increasing activity in Masonry, especially the Shrine, becoming Potentate of the Los Angeles Temple in 1939. By the time he had stopped making movies altogether in 1949, he had become Imperial Potentate of the Shrine in North America, the first actor ever to be so recognized. He was installed into this prestigious position at Soldier Field in Chicago in the presence of a crowd of 90,000 including the then President of the United States and <span style="color:#FF0040">fellow Shriner, Ill. Harry S. Truman, 33°</span>.<br>
<br>
..During the 1950s and 1960s, much of his time was devoted to the Shrine Hospitals, and he said his work for the Shrine gave him more satisfaction than anything he'd done in the previous decades. He was appointed a Director of the Shrine Hospitals for Crippled Children, and in 1963 he was elected President of the Shriners Hospital Corporation and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Shriners Hospitals for Crippled Children. His involvement in these activities was so pervasive that his granddaughter, Suzanne, believed for years that his occupation was that of Hospital Administrator.<br>
<br>
..In 1962, he produced a compilation of some of his best films, Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy, and took it to the Cannes Film Festival where he was honored by a standing ovation. Due to this favorable reception, Lloyd released another compilation of his works, titled The Funny Side of Life, in 1964. It featured another of his famous films, The Freshman.<br>

Harold Lloyd Estate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lloyd_Estate" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lloyd_Estate</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Harold Lloyd Estate, also known as Greenacres, is a large mansion and landscaped estate located in the Benedict Canyon section of Beverly Hills, California. Built in the late 1920s by silent film star Harold Lloyd, it remained Lloyd's home until his death in 1971. The estate originally consisted of a 44-room mansion, golf course, outbuildings, and 900-foot (270 m) canoe run on 15 acres (61,000 m2). Greenacres has been called "the most impressive movie star's estate ever created."[3] After Lloyd died, the acreage in the lower part of the estate along Benedict Canyon was subdivided into approximately 14 large home lots. The mansion, on top of its own hill, retained approximately 5 original acres of flat land. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984...<br>
<br>
In August 1925, Lloyd announced plans to built a $1 million estate on the 15-acre site, including a three-story French-Italian Renaissance home, a nine-acre golf course, a 50' x 150' swimming pool (the largest in southern California) an open-air theater, dance pavillion, tennis courts, and bridle path. Sumner Spaulding (Webber, Staunton and Spalding) was hired as the architect..<br>
<br>
An unusual feature was the separate fairyland estate that Lloyd and A.E. Hanson designed for Lloyd's four-year-old daughter, Mildred Gloria. The play village had its own private gate with a sign reading, "Come into my garden and play."[12] The fairyland estate included a four-room miniature old English house, a miniature old English stable with a pony and cart, Great Dane dogs, a wishing well with water for the daughter's garden, a slide, acrobatic devices and a swing.[12] The miniature house had electricity and a kitchen and bath with running water, where the Lloyds' daughter played with friends, including Shirley Temple...<br>
<br>

<br>
*"<span style="color:#FF0040">Clinton stayed at Green Acres often enough</span> so that a bedroom was designated for his use."<br>
<br>
"The two men decided that Clinton would become a partner in several of these funds, helping to find investors and projects. “I spent all my time with him,” Burkle said. They travelled the world on Burkle’s 757, clocking hundreds of flight hours."<br>
<br>
"In April, 2002, his wife, Janet, moved out of Green Acres and, the next year, filed for divorce. Around that time, Burkle was seen at an L.A. night club, with “two drop-dead-gorgeous girls, maybe twenty years old, one on either arm,” a person who was at the club said. “It was such a statement: I can do whatever I want.”<br>

..But what really rankles some Hollywood folk is his résumé, which suggests that if he keeps at it he could be the next Scott Rudin. In a landscape dominated by mind-numbing, big-budget tentpole movies, he’s produced two recent films—The Social Network and Captain Phillips—that earned Oscar nominations, got critical raves, and turned big profits, a combination that’s becoming increasingly rare. He has also helped change the face of entertainment delivery systems with the Netflix streaming series House of Cards. ..<br>

..In January, along with his business partner, Kevin Spacey, he swept in to save Relativity, Ryan Kavanaugh’s studio that had recently crashed and nearly burned... Spacey, who gave Brunetti his first Hollywood job, as his personal assistant, appreciated Brunetti’s “common sense and his bullshit radar” and found in him a rare tenacity. ...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>. Scott Fitzgerald famously remarked that “there are no second acts in American lives,” but the remaking of the Bob Hope house in Palm Springs might be considered an exception to that rule.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the drive and deep pockets of billionaire investor Ron Burkle, the restoration of the 24,000-square-foot home — in a manner consistent with the original design of architect John Lautner — is almost finished. The results of the 2 ½-year project are eagerly awaited by architecture buffs, Lautner groupies and residents of the Coachella Valley....<br>
<br>
As a longtime journalist based in Los Angeles, I frequently covered fundraisers and charity events at Burkle’s Greenacres mansion, a Beverly Hills estate designed for silent film star Harold Lloyd. In 2016, when I heard that the billionaire had purchased the desert home built for Dolores and Bob Hope, I immediately called his office...<br>
<br>
As construction was wrapping up, I managed an invitation to a party at another one of Burkle’s properties, the members-only <span style="color:#FF0040">Soho house in West Hollywood</span>.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Retired New York Supreme Court Justice Ronald H. Tills, 74, has been sentenced to 18 months in federal prison for a felony charge of transporting prostitutes across state lines (a violation of the Mann Act). He began serving his sentence on October 1, 2009.<br>
<br>
Tills’ long fall from grace, from a well-respected jurist known for imposing tough sentences to a federal prisoner, resulted following an investigation into the Royal Order of Jesters, a Masonic group that has 191 chapters and 22,000 members nationwide.<br>
<br>
The probe, conducted by the Western New York Human Trafficking Task Force, began in late 2007 after federal agents learned that a judge and a police captain were among the customers of a Niagara County massage parlor that hired illegal immigrants to work as prostitutes.<br>
<br>
At sentencing, U.S. District Judge William M. Skretny admonished Tills for victimizing the most vulnerable illegal immigrants, “the undocumented women involved in the sex trade.” One woman, Coco, barely spoke English and had been sold into sexual slavery. Tills took her across state lines to work at a Jesters convention in Kentucky.<br>
<br>
Further, Tills reportedly engaged in a sexual relationship with a woman who appeared before him in court and recruited her to work as a prostitute at a Jesters convention. Likewise, he recruited prostitutes who appeared before him to provide sexual services at such conventions.<br>
<br>
The federal investigation also resulted in the convictions of two other members of the Royal Order of Jesters – John Trowbridge, a former Lockport police captain, and Michael R. Stebick, Tills’ former law clerk. Trowbridge was sentenced to two years on probation. Stebick received four months of home confinement and was required to forfeit the motor home he used to transport prostitutes across state lines.<br>
<br>
A spokesman for the Jesters said only the group’s Buffalo, New York chapter had used prostitutes at organizational gatherings, which was “isolated, inappropriate” and not condoned by the national leadership. Several U.S. presidents, including Truman and Ford, as well as a number of other politicians have been members of the Jesters.<br>
<br>
“I quit the Jesters more than 20 years ago, and this kind of thing has been going on at least 40 or 50 years,” said former member Malcolm Herring. “I quit because I don’t drink, and I don’t mess around with other women, other than my wife. Going to one of their events was like going to a whorehouse.”</div></blockquote></div>
