It is one of the three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, an initiative begun in April 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission, and the government of France as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVAX aims to coordinate international resources to enable the equitable access of COVID-19 diagnostics, treatments, and COVID-19 vaccines...<br>
<br>
The United Kingdom has provided £548 million to COVAX.[23] The United Kingdom was the biggest single donor to COVAX-AMC until being overtaken by Germany and the United States....<br>
<br>
On 1 March 2021, frontline workers and public officials from the Ivory Coast became the first persons to be inoculated with COVID-19 vaccines shipped from the <span style="color:#FFFF40">COVAX Facility</span>. More than 500,000 doses of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Oxford–AstraZeneca</span> COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Serum Institute of India</span> were shipped to the city of Abidjan the week before. The vaccines were flown in by UNICEF from Mumbai..<br>
<br>
COVAX provides vaccines to the developing world....
