			<div class="content">Posting this in PG because PG started on voat following a ban...seems fitting to post a topic here on SVF about reddit hiring a so called 'pedo enabler' and then censoring the talk about it <a href="https://archive.is/aHhLD#selection-721.63-725.165" class="postlink">https://archive.is/aHhLD#selection-721.63-725.165</a><br>
<br>
"Overnight a slew of popular subreddits went private...<br>
<br>
<br>
"The mystery was soon solved: Redditors claim that the company hired a woman and is suspending anyone who mentions her name or her father’s conviction for pedophilia."<br>
<br>
"David Challenor was arrested for raping and torturing a 10-year-old girl in 2016. He was convicted by a United Kingdom court two years later and sentenced to more than 20 years in prison.<br>
<br>
"Around the time of his arrest, his daughter, Aimee (Challenor) Knight was a rising star in British politics. Her father’s charges ultimately derailed her political career. An inquiry by the Green Party deemed that she’d failed to properly alert them to the charges and made a serious error of judgment by having her father run her campaigns after his arrest.<br>
<br>
"Knight, a transgender activist who at the time was the party’s spokesperson on LGBTQ issues, accused the Green Party of transphobia. She later joined the Liberal Democrats. She was suspended from that party in 2019 based on her husbands’ tweets admitting to having sexual fantasies about children. She reportedly later claimed he’d been hacked."<br>
<br>
"According to multiple posts on Reddit, Knight now works for the company. They alleged the company is deleting posts about her father and suspending people who mention her. Efforts to contact Knight were unsuccessful. Reddit did not respond to request for comment sent Wednesday morning. In posts about the situation, it claimed that the suspensions were in error."<br>
<br>
"The controversy was ignited after a moderator on the UK Politics subreddit reportedly posted a link to a Spectator story about her father. The article contained a “three-word mention” of Knight, UK Politics claims. The moderator was subsequently permanently suspended for “doxing,” leading the Spectator to wonder whether Reddit was “censoring” the publication."<br>
A post on UK Politics says they were reinstated after they contacted the administrators."<br>
<br>
The UK Politics moderators took the unusual and drastic step of making the sub private.<br>
“As we had no idea what had happened, or why posting this article resulted in a permanent suspension, we took the emergency step of making the subreddit private and immediately contacting the admins for clarification,” it states."<br>
<br>
"They urged their members to refrain from mentioning Knight to avoid further enforcement."<br>
<br>
UPDATE, Aimee Knight is no longer working at Reddit according to CEO statement: <br>
<br>
"Update, 6:45PM ET: Reddit says it’s cut ties with an employee widely identified as former UK politician Aimee Knight, following a shutdown of hundreds of communities. CEO Steve Huffman posted a statement confirming that the site had been overzealous trying to prevent harassment, resulting in a moderator being banned for posting an article that referenced Knight’s name.<br>
<br>
“We would like to give you all an update on the recent issues that have transpired concerning a specific Reddit employee, as well as provide you with context into actions that we took to prevent doxxing and harassment. As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on [Reddit Public Access Network]. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her,” wrote Huffman. “Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348255/reddit-moderator-blackout-protest-aimee-knight-uk-green-party" class="postlink">https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/2234 ... reen-party</a><br>
<br>
"An independent report concluded that as a result of Knight and other members’ actions, “someone who had committed serious sexual offenses was given roles of responsibility within the Green Party during a period of almost two years.” Soon after, in 2019, Knight was also suspended by the Liberal Democrats party when her now-husband appeared to post comments about having fantasies involving sex with children on Twitter. Knight said that the account had been hacked."</div>

P<span style="color:#FFFF40">art of the group was former Plano Mayor John Longstreet</span>, who, having leased office place from Philip’s father, Claudio Silvestri, is a dear friend of the family.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>During spring break of his senior year at UVA, Huffman and college roommate Alexis Ohanian[1] drove to Boston, Massachusetts, to attend a lecture[6] delivered by programmer-entrepreneur Paul Graham.[1][7] Huffman and Ohanian talked with Graham after the lecture and he invited them to apply to his startup incubator Y Combinator.[1] Huffman came up with their original idea, My Mobile Menu,[7] which was intended to allow users to order food by SMS.[1][7] The idea was rejected, but <span style="color:#FFFF40">Graham asked Huffman and Ohanian to meet him in Boston to pitch another idea for a start-up; it was at this brainstorming session that the idea for what Graham called the "front page of the Internet" was created</span>.[1] Huffman and Ohanian were accepted in Y Combinator's first class.[1][7] Huffman coded the entire site in Lisp.[8][9] He and Ohanian launched Reddit in June 2005, funded by Y Combinator</div></blockquote>

I'm guessing that idea came from Paul Graham.. let's check him out.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_%28programmer%29" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paul Graham (/ɡræm/; born 13 November 1964)[1] is an English-born American computer scientist, essayist, entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and author. ..<br>
<br>
Graham and his family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1968, where he later attended Gateway High School. Graham gained interest in science and mathematics from his father who was a nuclear physicist.</div></blockquote>

One of his tweets : <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1374819390676426756" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1374819390676426756</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Apparently my news sources lean so far left that I "may have a blindspot on the right" I'm happy with my top three news influencers though.</div></blockquote>

So, his first listed 'influencer' is Patrick Collision <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/about" class="postlink">https://patrickcollison.com/about</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I live in San Francisco and work at Stripe. I grew up in Ireland and previously studied math at MIT. I am on the boards of Stripe and the Long Now Foundation</div></blockquote>

Long Now Foundation?  Uh huh.. <a href="https://longnow.org/people/board/sb1/" class="postlink">https://longnow.org/people/board/sb1/</a><br>
<br>
A long list of board members like Esther Dyson and Brian Eno... <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">AND we're back to elite pedophiles</span></span>.<br>
<br>
I can link that board of futurists to Epstein, Brockman, Gates, the Parvati Foundation and much more... But not today. Time to take a break.</div>

			<div class="content">During Aimee Knight's time as a mod on Reddit she was acting as an activist to enforce Marxist 'right think' (which cloaks itself under the guise of anti racism social justice').<br>
From The Atlantic 2020 article: Reddit Is Finally Facing Its Legacy of Racism <a href="https://archive.is/21WiI#selection-881.519-885.190" class="postlink">https://archive.is/21WiI#selection-881.519-885.190</a><br>
<br>
2018 ".. an open letter to CEO Huffman was posted all over the site, urged the company to take racism more seriously. “The problem of Reddit’s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue,” it began, before listing demands, including the proactive banning of hateful communities and “a sitewide policy against racism, slurs, and hate speech.” (Huffman responded to the letter in the post’s comments, writing in part, “Your list and our list have a high amount of overlap.” A Reddit spokesperson declined to comment further.)..."<br>
<br>
 "Aimee Knight, a 22-year-old moderator of r/transgenderteens, asked her subreddit to sign on to the letter because of its similarities to an open letter it published last month about raids on LGBTQ subreddits. “Subreddit moderators in general are becoming louder and more united in our stance against abusive behavior on Reddit,” she told me."</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>One of Aimee Challenor's partners, Katrina Swales / Knight, has been removed from one of the children's Reddit groups they were moderating. Katrina's story has been detailed here: <a href="https://grahamlinehan.substack.com/p/ashton-challenor-the-boy-who-disappeared" class="postlink">https://grahamlinehan.substack.com/p/as ... isappeared</a></div></blockquote>

<a href="https://grahamlinehan.substack.com/p/ashton-challenor-the-boy-who-disappeared" class="postlink">https://grahamlinehan.substack.com/p/as ... isappeared</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Meet Peter “Katrina” Swales, a trans-identified male, freelance programmer and very close friend of the Knight-Challenors. On social media Swales’s aliases include nekosuneAD and nekosune. It’s the name of his own personal website and the handle he uses on Keybase.io and GlobalGameJam.com. (You will notice that Swales sometimes uses the surname Knight - more on that later.)..<br>
<br>
Swales is involved in various sexual fetish communities. He’s an “adult baby diaper lover” (which speaks for itself), a “furry” (someone who is a sexually aroused by role playing anthropomorphic / cartoon animal characters) and a “babyfur” (a branch of furrydom in which participants role-play as infantilised characters.)<br>
<br>
The image above is called “Sissy Kitten”. It is one of the pictures posted to a profile with the username “Nekosune”, undoubtedly Swales, on a furry fetish website. It is one of several ‘sissy porn’ animal images on that profile. This is significant as ‘sissy porn’ is a particular grubby crevasse of porn culture in which males find sexual gratification by being humiliated and degraded in a submissive female persona, very often role-playing as little girls or young teens.<br>
<br>
Swales is the moderator of over 80 Reddit communities. Most of them are LGBT sites and many (eg r/lgbt_KidsZone and r/transgenderteens) are aimed at children and/or young teenagers.<br>
<br>
Some of the sites moderated by Swales (eg r/hypnocaptions and r/TransBodies) involve nudity and sexually explicit content and several (eg r/pokegirls/) contain paedophilic images.<br>
<br>
Evidence suggests that Swales was (and probably still is) in an intimate relationship with Aimee Challenor and Nathaniel Knight. Swales often calls himself Knight online. Here is his LinkedIn profile, for example.<br>
<br>
Knight is now Aimee Challenor’s married name. In 2017 Aimee Challenor talked on social media about travelling to Aberdeen to ‘visit family’. Based on his response to this comment, the ‘family’ in question obviously included Swales.<br>
<br>
The other person mentioned in Swales’ reply is feefers, aka “Fiona” Brown, another trans-identified male with a furry / babyfur/adult baby nappy fetish who, like Swales, lives in Aberdeen. (Brown also goes by the handles Fionacat and Fiona Lovecraft.)..

			<div class="content">Thanks for all the digs, I didn't realize I needed a puke bucket before reading about Aimee (Challenor) Knight's circle of friends and family.  Apparently convicted child rapist/torturer (of a 10 year old girl), Papa Challenor was also (like Aimee's partner 'Katrina') a 'nappies' grade pervert: <br>
<br>
"It emerged that Challenor senior committed his crimes while dressed as a little girl, wearing baby-doll dresses and nappies." <br>
<br>
It's also creepy how much Aimee and 'Katrina' look like they could be twins (their faces). A pair of cold smug fish.</div>

Who knows if she was into meeting furry diapersexuals when she was known as Ashton <a href="https://archive.is/ahirF" class="postlink">https://archive.is/ahirF</a><br>
'"General Election candidate Aimee Challenor was arrested four years ago on suspicion of threatening to launch a cyber attack on the Birmingham Bullring Shopping Centre, the Telegraph can reveal.<br>
The Green Party candidate, who is transgender, was living as a boy at the time of the arrest in February 2013 when she was 15 years old. But no charges were ever brought and the case was later dropped. Her identity was protected until she turned 19.<br>
At the time of the arrest, Miss Challenor attached herself to the group of internet activists known as Anonymous and was suspected of threatening to bring the Bullring website down after a disagreement with security guards during a tax evasion protest at the site."<br>

Admits to being screwed up (wetting the bed at age 15) because she was surrounded by fetishists from a young age.<br>

this didn't make it into the archive but it's a retweet by Aimee (Mucky Meerkat), so she thinks LMAO meaning 'Let's Murder An Orphan' is funny:<br>

Got kids on twitter? Here's a guide to twitter slang. <br>
DM: Doing Meth<br>
BTW: Bring The Weed<br>
RT: Really Tripping<br>
LMAO: Let's Murder An Orphan<br>
<br>
Why was Aimee's furry fetish dad, now convicted pedo-rapist/torturer of a 10 year old girl, and her dysfunctional mother's then cheesy love story, ever worth publishing, even as tabloid material? <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/moved-together-36-hours-after-5041659" class="postlink">https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life ... er-5041659</a><br>
<br>
Some years later... Dad was newsworthy <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-sick-torture-den-twisted-13128981" class="postlink">https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i ... d-13128981</a> <br>
Inside sick 'torture den' where twisted sadist tied girl, 10, to beam and gave her electric shocks<br>
"After leaving, she was initially too frightened to tell anyone what he had done - but eventually did so.<br>
<br>
She confided in someone what had happened, which was reported to the police who interviewed her towards the end of 2015."<br>
EDIT: (the rape occurred in 2010)<br>
<br>
"As the police investigation and later trial progressed, Aimee cut off all relations with the victim, supporting Daddy wholeheartedly, nominating him for a 'Best Dad' prize in June 2018, using him as his election agent and generally sucking up. It is not known if Aimee was called as a witness at the trial, however Tina (Aimee's mom) was, and continued to call the victim a liar and support David." <a href="https://kiwifarms.net/threads/aimee-challenor-ashton-lucas-david-challenor-aimee-knight.47181/" class="postlink">https://kiwifarms.net/threads/aimee-cha ... ght.47181/</a><br>

<br>
Aimee said it wasn’t until 2014, when she attended Henley College, that she felt able to be open about being transgender and actively campaign around LGBT issues.<br>
Asked about the decision to run for election so soon after such a dramatic life change, she said: “I wouldn’t say it’s brave.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
...aaaand that's the Green Party in a nutshell!  Or nutcase more like. /s (Although even the Green Party had to give Aimee the boot, though she might have preferred some cozy knit baby booties instead!)</div>

<br>
They describe themselves as an Amazon affiliate but there's little to no further information about them on their website which usually means one thing to me.. <em class="text-italics">cough</em>..<br>
<br>
They post ALOT of stuff about Elon Musk and SpaceX and Musk is the first Twitter account that they followed.  <br>
<br>
Speaking of Amazon and SpaceX : <span style="color:#00FF40">SpaceX’s Elon Musk and Amazon’s Project Kuiper stir up a war of words over satellites</span> <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spacexs-elon-musk-amazons-project-kuiper-stir-war-words-satellites/" class="postlink">https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spacexs-e ... atellites/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Musk complained that Amazon’s protest would “hamstring” SpaceX’s Starlink broadband satellites, while Amazon replied that SpaceX was seeking to “smother competition in the cradle if it can.”
</div></blockquote>

It's the Deep State's age-old old routine of providing 2 supposedly opposing titans to give the illusion of competition when they are both working for the same people. And to distract the people from the fact that they really need to be investigating what exactly all these satellite companies are doing up in space.<br>
<br>
Bill Gates has his own satellites, so does Pierre Omidyar and Nicole Junkermann too.</div>

			<div class="content">We have a lot of Y Combinator posts btw... like:<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">Elon Musk and Human Brain Chipping - Transhumanism in action. Are their Jeffrey Epstein and Junkermann connections? Hell, yeah...</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3372538" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3372538</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>OpenAI is the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP, whose parent organization is the non-profit organization OpenAI Inc[3] that conducts research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the stated aim to promote and develop friendly AI in such a way as to benefit humanity as a whole. ..The founders (notably Elon Musk and Sam Altman) are motivated in part by concerns about existential risk from artificial general intelligence.<br>
<br>
In 2009, Sequoia Capital led the $2 million investment round into an entity of Y Combinator.. Sequoia Capital is an interesting company because of its deep links to the intelligence community.. it has close links with In-Q-Tel, the CIA venture capital firm..<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">In-Q-Tel (named after "Q" in the James Bond films)</span> invests in companies that can deliver useful technology to the intelligence community within 36 months.</div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Y Combinator takes machine intelligence startups to school and learns a thing or two</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/AI/2091554" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/AI/2091554</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FFFF40">Daniel Gross, a Partner at Y Combinator</span> and the brains behind the AI track, explained to me that his aim was to offer founders desirable data sets, compute resources and technical mentors, among other things. With experience founding a company and solving machine learning problems for Apple, Gross’ relatable technical background helps to emphasize the legitimacy of the storied accelerator.<br>
<br>
..Moving past APIs and other developer services, perception and autonomy were easily the most populated spaces for startups within the YC AI track. The perception subcategory includes startups like Standard Cognition, automating store checkout, VergeSense, facility management, CureSkin, classifying skin conditions, Modular Science, robotic farming, and D-ID, obfuscating faces for security. With a bias towards deep learning, these companies are exploiting unique data sets and readily available compute to automate tasks that were previously inconceivable.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, on the autonomy front, startups like May Mobility, creating autonomous vehicles, and Zendar, building its own radar, are very desirable on the M&amp;A front as automakers and suppliers look to stand their ground in the rapidly evolving transportation space.</div></blockquote></div>
