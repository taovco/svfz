Today as people discuss the current media psyop about COVID and India, I came across an interesting graph about the treatment of C19 there : <blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/xnsyq0.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

I also saw last night a discussion about the different vaccines being used around the world and whether there may be different varieties of the same brand depending on the region and the population..<br>
<br>
There are two Covid-19 vaccines that are being used in India right now -- Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield. <a href="https://www.livemint.com/science/health/when-should-you-get-the-second-dose-of-covaxin-covishield-things-to-know-11619280294796.html" class="postlink">https://www.livemint.com/science/health ... 94796.html</a><br>

Serum Institute?  I recently wrote about them. See:<br>

So, I thought I'd take a closer look at Adar..<br>
<br>
Adar Poonawalla was educated at The Bishop's School (Pune), St Edmund's School Canterbury followed by the University of Westminster...In 2011, he became the CEO. <span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:#FFFF40">In 2012, he played a major role in the acquisition of Bilthoven Biologicals</span></span>, a Netherlands-based government vaccine manufacturing company.[6][7] Poonawalla is a board member of the GAVI Alliance, the global vaccine alliance.<br>

..COVAX provides vaccines to the developing world.... In February 2021, the WHO and <span style="color:#FF0040">Chubb Limited</span> announced the roll out of a no-fault compensation scheme for COVID-19 vaccinations for low and middle-income countries which would be financed initially through Gavi COVAX AMC donor funding.... <br>
<br>

Greenberg, the former chairman and CEO of American International Group (AIG). Maurice is currently chairman and chief executive officer of C.V.

He donated to Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy..Cornelius Vander Starr also known as Neil Starr or C. V. Starr (October 15, 1892 – December 20, 1968) was an American businessman and operative of the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the CIA</div></blockquote>

I'm definitely not getting warm fuzzy feelings about those vaccines.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) is a knowledge and research institute in the Netherlands, aimed at promoting public health and a healthy and safe living environment . ..<br>
<br>
The RIVM has a history that dates back to 1909. It was founded in Utrecht on Catharijnesingel under the name Central Laboratory for the State Supervision and was led by Charles Henri Ali Cohen . [3] Capacity was limited, while the supply of work increased rapidly: the Spanish flu , food research, diphtheria , tuberculosis , typhoid and syphilis , but water pollution also played a role.<br>
<br>
Partly due to the medical developments as a result of the First World War , the Bacterio-Therapeutic Institute of Professor Charles Henri Hubert Spronck was taken over by the government in 1919 . After a shared accommodation, this now renamed National Serological Institute was merged with the Central Laboratory in 1934 to form the National Institute for Public Health (RIV).<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">In 1953 the RIV moved to its current location in Bilthoven</span> . This was suitable to provide sufficient space for the staff, the work and the laboratory animals . It was set up on a large scale so that the Netherlands would no longer be dependent on imports for vaccines and, if necessary, in the event of a war with the Eastern bloc , to be able to manufacture sufficient sera and vaccines for NATO 's military apparatus .<br>
<br>
On June 10, 2009,<span style="color:#FFFF40"> Queen Beatrix visited the RIVM in connection with the centenary of the institute</span>.... As part of the reduction in the number of civil servants in the national government , <span style="color:#FFFF40">the National Poisons Information Center (NVIC) has been transferred from 2011 to UMC Utrecht</span> ..<br>
<br>
RIVM and the Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) are expected to move from the current campus in Bilthoven to an eighteen-storey building on the Uithof in Utrecht in the autumn of 2021 . The design is by Felix Claus Dick of Wageningen Architecten.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Kees Boeke  <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kees_Boeke_%28pedagoog%29" class="postlink">https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kees_Boeke_(pedagoog)</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Cornelis (Kees) Boeke ( Alkmaar , September 25, 1884 - Amsterdam , July 3, 1966 ) was a Dutch pedagogue . In 1926 he founded a school, the Werkplaats Kindergemeenschap (WP) in Bilthoven ..During his studies he was a member of the Dutch Christian Student Association (NCSV), which was founded in 1896 . In the nineties of the nineteenth century, the NCSV was the first step of the youth of the well-to-do class to join together on idealistic grounds. In addition to being a member, Boeke became chairman of the board of the local chapter. After studying at the Technical College he moved to England where he became acquainted with followers of the religion of the Quakers. He married <span style="color:#FFFF40">Beatrice Cadbury, daughter of the wealthy chocolate manufacturer and Quaker.</span> In 1918 he returned to the Netherlands...<br>
<br>
...Boeke, who had a coherent view of life and society and was sensitive to Eastern wisdom,<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> theosophy , anthroposophy,</span></span> mysticism and a religion inspired by Christianity, had become concerned that the actions of the politically interested working class youth would lead to revolution and yet another war. <span style="color:#FFFF40">In 1921, Kees and Beatrice Boeke-Cadbury hosted an international conference for peace. On that occasion War Resisters' International was founded. </span>Known to many for the symbol of the broken rifle...<br>
<br>
..Boeke was inspired by the professor of theology <span style="color:#FF0040">Jacobus Johannes van der Leeuw [a Dutch theosophist] </span> . While studying law, Van der Leeuw had introduced the "Practical-Idealists Association" (PIA) from London to the Netherlands, which was the second step of the well-to-do youth to join together on idealistic grounds. Many members of PIA came from the very wealthy circles. Van der Leeuw's father was financially interested in the Van Nelle factories. <br>
<br>
Cosmic View <br>
Boeke's book Cosmic View, The Universe in 40 Jumps from 1957 (translated into Dutch as Wij in het universal, een universe in ons , 1959) gives a view of the universe that has inspired others. It shows the universe on different scales: from microscopic to galactic. Various films have been inspired by it..<br>
<br>
Cosmic View is also mentioned as a source of inspiration by<span style="color:#FF0040"> Will Wright , the creator of the computer game Spore (2008)</span>.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>J.J. van der Leeuw (nickname 'Koos'), member of the family Van der Leeuw, was born August 26, 1893 in Rotterdam, son of Marius Adrianus Gabriël van der Leeuw Sr. (1856-1923) and Madelaine van Dam (1868-1929). Marius van der Leeuw was partner of the firm Erven de Wed. J. van Nelle, wholesalers in coffee, tea and tobacco. Koos and his brothers Cees (Cornelis Hendrik van der Leeuw, 1890-1973) and Dick (Marius Adrianus Gabriël van der Leeuw, 1894-1936) were known in Rotterdam as “The Dandys” due to their modern and luxurious lifestyle. Van der Leeuw died in a plane crash in Tanganyika, Africa, on August 23, 1934. He was single without children...<br>
<br>
During his study years he founded the Dutch section of the English Practical Idealists Association (PIA), a youth movement aimed at initiating a paradigm shift of the spiritual mind amongst students. Other members in this organization included Adriaan Viruly and Kees Boeke. Because of his scientific aspirations it soon became clear that Van der Leeuw would not become his father’s successor as CEO at Van Nelle. In 1920 he received his PhD at Leiden University with a thesis titled Historical Idealist Politics.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:#FF0040">Theosophy</span></span><br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">J.J. van der Leeuw was a close friend of Jiddu Krishnamurti</span>. Just like his brother Cees, he was closely involved with hosting the annual <span style="color:#BFFF40">Order of the Star camps at the Eerde estate in Ommen</span>. This property was owned by Philip baron van Pallandt and it was here that Krishnamurti had settled his Order of the Star in the East.<br>
<br>
In 1924 J.J. van der Leeuw went to Australia for occult training with <span style="color:#FF0040">C.W. Leadbeater</span>, who was at that time guiding young people spiritually in Sydney. J.J. van der Leeuw became a priest in the Liberal Catholic Church and treasurer of the Manor, the villa owned by the Theosophical Society in Sydney. There he also founded the King Arthur’s School for boys. Back in the Netherlands van der Leeuw was elected as president of the Dutch Section of the Theosophical Society from 1930 until 1931.<br>
<br>
He was well known for his lecture Revelation or Realization, The Conflict in Theosophy which he held at the Federation of Theosophical Lodges in London on June 15, 1930, at the Dutch convention on June 21, 1930, and before the Congress of the European Federation on June 30, 1930. In this lecture he publicly defended Krishnamurti who had disbanded the Order of the Star in 1929.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Political Activities</span><br>
In the early Thirties Van der Leeuw traveled the world to elaborate on his social-scientific and philosophical ideas.

Besides all this he was also dedicated to education.<br>
<br>
Van der Leeuw lived in London, but during 1933 was <span style="color:#FF0040">a regular visitor of Sigmund Freud in Vienna</span>, where he was being analyzed. <br>
<br>
Van der Leeuw received his pilot’s license in 1933. In 1934 he was invited by The New Education Fellowship in South Africa to hold a lecture during their Johannesburg conference. Especially for this purpose Van der Leeuw bought a De Havilland Leopard Moth (GA-CCLX). During his return flight from this conference Van der Leeuw crashed into a mountain the republic of Tanganyika. His demise received a lot of attention by both the national and international press.</div></blockquote>

New Commonwealth Society <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Commonwealth_Society" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Commonwealth_Society</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The New Commonwealth was an international organization created in London in 1932 with branches in France and Germany. It advocated pacifism, disarmament and multilateral resolution of conflicts through political lobbying and different publications...<br>
<br>
The New Commonwealth Society was created in October 1932 in London, with the forme Labour member of parliament George Barnes as its first President, and with Henry de Jouvenel of France, Ernst Jäckh of Germany, and the American Oscar T. Crosby as vice-presidents.[1] It advocated the creation of an international tribunal and an international police force..<br>
<br>
Later, the Society defended the creation of an international air force which would act as a military arm of the League of Nations, promoting disarmament and keeping the world's peace. Those promoting the New Commonwealth included the millionaire David Davies, 1st Baron Davies, who became its chairman, others who had taken part in building up the League of Nations Union, and Winston Churchill, who was elected as the organization's president. Ernst Jaeckh was appointed as international director<br>
<br>
In a speech to the Society in May 1937, Churchill said:<br>
<em class="text-italics">We are one of the few peace societies that advocates the use of force, if possible overwhelming force, to support public international law.</em><br>
<br>
Some of the ideas of the New Commonwealth Society were later incorporated into the United Nations Charter.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Shiben Banerji (School of the Art Institute of Chicago, USA), Woodrow Wilson s Great Mistake: Self-Determination and the Theosophical Concept of Peace In 1944, an American architect named Marion Mahony wrote an essay imagining a post-war world in which a sense of responsibility to the other would bind different races, nationalities, and species together. At the time of the essay s drafting, Mahony who in 1898 became the first woman to be licensed as an architect in the United States had just completed laying out the site plan for a pacifist commune in New Hampshire. Called the World Fellowship Center, this place gathered Theosophists and members of other heterodox movements in order to convert the war effort into a lasting global peace.<br>
<br>
Mahony s 1944 essay did not make any direct reference to the physical layout of the World Fellowship Center, but it shared the Center's conceptual outlook and conviction that hostile feelings could be converted into their opposite. Specifically, Mahony s essay distilled the disparate cries of American isolationism and anti-colonial nationalism into an opportunity to create a borderless, worldwide economic community that shared a single international currency. This paper interrogates the practice of condensing discontinuous claims into a constitutive moment as a literary habit one that drew on the circulation, excerpting, and reprinting of news stories on imperial policy and anti-imperial struggles across the Anglophone world. Crucially, the abstract entity produced by this habit was neither the colonial state nor its nationalist alter ego. Instead, it was a globalizing mechanism that lacked attachment to territory and demos. By examining the Theosophical Society s transnational inquiry into the League of Nations and Woodrow Wilson s principle of national self-determination, this paper uncovers an internal dispute within modern occultism over the precise character of the mechanism needed to guarantee global peace. <span style="color:#FF0040">Prominent exponents of occult science like J.J. van der Leeuw attributed the failure of the League of Nations to its lack of a superstate police force</span>, whereas others like Marion Mahony called for the formation of supranational, non-governmental organization.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

Ariosophy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariosophy" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariosophy</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Armanism and Ariosophy are esoteric ideological systems that were pioneered by Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels respectively, in Austria between 1890 and 1930. The term 'Ariosophy', which means the wisdom of the Aryans, was first coined by Lanz von Liebenfels in 1915 and in the 1920s, it became the name of his doctrine. In research on the topic, such as Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke's book The Occult Roots of Nazism, the term 'Ariosophy' is generically used to describe the Aryan-esoteric theories of a subset of the 'Völkische Bewegung'.[1] This broader use of the word is retrospective and it was not generally current among the esotericists themselves. List actually called his doctrine 'Armanism', while Lanz used the terms 'Theozoology' and 'Ario-Christianity' before the First World War...<br>
<br>
The ideas of Von List and Lanz von Liebenfels were part of a general occult revival that occurred in Austria and Germany during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a revival was loosely inspired by Christianity, historical Germanic paganism and holistic philosophy as well as by esoteric concepts that were influenced by <span style="color:#FF0040">German romanticism and Theosophy</span>. The connection between this form of Germanic mysticism and historical Germanic culture is evident in the mystics' fascination with runes, in the form of Guido von List's Armanen runes...<br>
<br>
Guido von List elaborated a racial religion premised on the concept of renouncing the imposed foreign creed of Christianity and returning to the pagan religions of the ancient Indo-Europeans (List preferred the equivalent term Ario-Germanen, or 'Aryo-Germanics'). List recognised the theoretical distinction between the Proto-Indo-European language and its daughter Proto-Germanic language but frequently obscured it by his tendency to treat them as a single long-lived entity (although this framing is also used in linguistics as the Germanic parent language).[9] In this, <span style="color:#FF0040">he became strongly influenced by the Theosophical thought of Madame Blavatsky, which he blended however with his own highly original beliefs, founded upon Germanic paganism</span>

..List died on 17 May 1919, a few months before Adolf Hitler joined a minor Bavarian political party and formed it into the NSDAP. After the Nazis had come to power, several advocates of Armanism fell victim to the suppression of esotericism in Nazi Germany...<br>
<br>
..In 1903–4, a Viennese ex-Cistercian monk, Bible scholar and inventor named Jörg Lanz-Liebenfels (subsequently, Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels) published a lengthy article under the Latin title "Anthropozoon Biblicum" ("The Biblical Man-Animal") in a journal for Biblical studies edited by Moritz Altschüler, a Jewish admirer of Guido von List...The author undertook a comparative survey of ancient Near Eastern cultures, in which he detected evidence from iconography and literature that seemed to point to the continued survival, into early historical times, of hominid ape-men similar to the dwarfish Neanderthal men known from fossil remains in Europe, or the Pithecanthropus (now called Homo erectus) from <span style="color:#FFFF40"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Java</span></span>..<br>
<br>
..In 1905 he expanded these researches into a fundamental statement of doctrine titled Theozoologie oder die Kunde von den Sodoms-Äfflingen und dem Götter-Elektron[42] ("Theozoology, or the Science of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Sodomite-Apelings</span> and the Divine Electron"). He claimed that "Aryan" peoples originated from interstellar deities (termed Theozoa) who bred by electricity, while "lower" races were a result of interbreeding between humans and ape-men (or Anthropozoa). The effects of racial crossing caused the atrophy of paranormal powers inherited from the gods, but these could be restored by the selective breeding of pure Aryan lineages. The book relied on somewhat lurid sexual imagery, decrying the abuse of white women by ethnically inferior but sexually active men. Thus, Lanz advocated mass castration of racially "apelike" or otherwise "inferior" males.<br>
<br>
..In the same year, Lanz commenced publication of the journal Ostara (named after a pagan Germanic goddess of spring) to promote his vision of racial purity. On December 25, 1907, he founded <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">the Order of the New Templars (Ordo Novi Templi, or ONT)</span></span>, a mystical association with its headquarters at Burg Werfenstein, a castle in Upper Austria overlooking the river Danube. Its declared aim was to harmonise science, art and religion on a basis of racial consciousness. Rituals were designed to beautify life in accordance with Aryan aesthetics, and to express the Order's theological system that Lanz called Ario-Christianity. The Order was the first to use the swastika in an "Aryan" meaning, displaying on its flag the device of a red swastika facing right, on a yellow-orange field and surrounded by four blue fleurs-de-lys..<br>
<br>

The ONT declined from the mid-1930s and - even though it had pioneered many ideas that the Nazis later adopted - it was suppressed by the Gestapo in 1942. By this time it had established seven communities in Austria, Germany and Hungary. Though suspending its activities in the Greater German Reich, the ONT survived in Hungary until around the end of World War II.[44] It went underground in Vienna after 1945, but was contacted in 1958 by a former Waffen-SS lieutenant, Rudolf Mund, who became Prior of the Order in 1979.[45] Mund also wrote biographies of Lanz and Wiligut.<br>
<br>
...The term "Ariosophy" (wisdom concerning the Aryans) was coined by Lanz von Liebenfels in 1915, with "Theozoology" describing its Genesis and "Ario-Christianity" as the label for the overall doctrine in the 1920s.[Note 7]<br>
<br>
This terminology was taken up by a group of occultists, formed in Berlin around 1920 and referred to by one of its main figures, Ernst Issberner-Haldane, as the 'Swastika-Circle'. Lanz's publisher, Herbert Reichstein, made contact with the group in 1925 and formed it into an institute with himself as director. This association was named the Ariosophical Society in 1926, renamed the Neue Kalandsgesellschaft (from Kaland, Guido von List's term for a secret lodge or conventicle) in 1928, and renamed again as the Ariosophische Kulturzentrale in 1931, the year in which it opened an Ariosophical School at Pressbaum that offered courses and lectures in <span style="color:#FF0040">runic lore, biorhythms, yoga and Qabalah</span>.</div>

 <span style="color:#FF0040">Rudolf von Sebottendorff</span> - A Freemason and a practitioner of sufism and astrology, Sebottendorff was also an admirer of Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels. Convinced that the Islamic and Germanic mystical systems shared a common Aryan root, he was attracted by Pohl's runic lore and became the Master of the Walvater's Bavarian province late in 1917. <br>
<br>
In 1918 Sebottendorff made contact with Walter Nauhaus, a member of the Germanenorden who headed a "Germanic study group" called the Thule Gesellschaft (Thule Society).[54] The name of Nauhaus's original Thule Society was adopted as a cover-name for Sebottendorff's Munich lodge of the Germanenorden Walvater when it was formally dedicated on August 18, 1918, with Pohl's assistance and approval.[55] Sebottendorff states that the group was run jointly by himself and Nauhaus.<br>
<br>
Deriving elements of its ideology and membership from earlier occult groups founded by List (Guido von List Society, established 1908) and Lanz von Liebenfels (the Order of the New Templars, established 1907), <span style="color:#FF0040">the Thule Society was dedicated to the triune god Walvater, identified with Wotan <span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">in triple form</span></span><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> [WWW ?]</span></span>. For the Society's emblem Sebottendorff selected the oak leaves, dagger and swastika.[52] The name Thule (an island located by Greek geographers at the northernmost extremity of the world) was chosen for its significance in the works of Guido von List. According to Thule Society mythology, Thule was the capital of Hyperborea, a legendary country supposedly in the far North polar regions, originally mentioned by Herodotus from Egyptian sources. In 1679, Olaf Rudbeck equated the Hyperboreans with the survivors of Atlantis, who were first mentioned by Plato, again following Egyptian sources..<br>
<br>
There is no evidence that Hitler himself had any connection with the Society, even as an associate or visitor. However, a member of the Thule Society, dentist Dr. Friedrich Krohn, did choose[citation needed] the swastika symbol for the Nazi party (although the design was revised at Hitler's insistence)..<br>
<br>
In 1923, Sebottendorff was expelled from Germany as an undesirable alien; around 1925, the Thule Society disbanded. In 1933, Sebottendorff returned to Germany and published Bevor Hitler kam: Urkundliches aus der Frühzeit der nationalsozialistischen Bewegung von Rudolf von Sebottendorff.[54] The book was banned by the Bavarian Political Police on March 1, 1934; Sebottendorff was arrested by the Gestapo, interned in a concentration camp, then expelled to Turkey yet again, where he committed suicide by drowning in the Bosphorus on May 9, 1945,[citation needed] as the Nazis surrendered to the Allies...<br>
<br>
Modern organisations<br>
<br>
The Armanen-Orden celebrates seasonal festivities in a similar fashion as Odinist groups do and invites interested people to these events. The highlights are three 'Things' at Ostara (Easter), Midsummer and Fall (Wotan's sacrificial death), which are mostly celebrated at castles close to sacred places, such as the Externsteine. The author Stefanie von Schnurbein attended a Fall Thing in 1990 and gives the following report in Religion als Kulturkritik (Religion and Cultural Criticism):<br>
<br>
…the participants meet in a room decorated with hand-woven wall hangings and pictures of Germanic gods, Odin and Frigga in this case… At one end of the room is a table covered with black cloth. On this a 4 ft. high wooden Irminsul, a spear, a sword, a replica of a sun disc chariot, a leather-bound copy of The Edda as well as ritual bowls and candles are placed. The participants are seated in a semi-circle in front of the table, the front row being occupied by Order members clothed in their ritual garb (black shirts for the men and long white dresses for the women; both have the AO emblem sewn on them)… after several invocations the 'spirit flame', symbolising Odin in the spirit world, is lit in a bowl filled with lamp oil. The purpose of this cultic celebration is the portrayal of Odin's concentration from spirit into matter. After a recital of the first part of Odin's rune poem () from The Edda, the "blood sacrifice" commences, in which a bowl with animal blood is raised to the beat of a gong and an invocation of sacrifice. Then Odin is called into the realm by the participants who assume the Odal rune stance, whisper 'W-O-D-A-N' nine times and finally sing an ode to Odin with the following words: 'Odin-Wodan come to us, od-uod, uod'. Wodan's sacrifice to himself is symbolised by extinguishing the flame.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Adam Alfred Rudolf Glauer (9 November 1875 – 8 May 1945?), also known as Rudolf Freiherr von Sebottendorff (or von Sebottendorf) was a German occultist, writer, intelligence agent and political activist. He was the founder of the Thule Society, a post-World War I German occultist organization where he played a key role, and that influenced many members of the Nazi Party. He was a Freemason,[1] a Sufi[2] of the Bektashi order - after his conversion to Islam[3] - and a practitioner of meditation, astrology, numerology, and alchemy.[4] He also used the alias Erwin Torre.<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">Glauer was an agent of the German military intelligence in neutral Istanbul during the period 1942–1945, while apparently also working as a double agent for the British military</span>. His German handler, Herbert Rittlinger, later described him as a "useless" agent (eine Null), but kept him on largely, it seems, because of an affection for "this strange, by then penniless man, whose history he did not know, who pretended enthusiasm for the Nazi cause and admiration for the SS but who in reality seemed little interested in either, much preferring to talk about Tibetans".</div></blockquote>

So, let me get this straight, Glauer who was instrumental in starting the Thule Society which is intrinsically connected to the Nazi Party was an intelligence officer who worked for the Germans and the British?</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mission Health, which traces its roots in the region back to 1885, operates six hospitals, numerous outpatient and surgery centers, home health provider CarePartners, and the region's only dedicated Level II trauma center. Its medical staff consists of more than 1,000 physicians and is certified in more than 50 medical specialties and sub-specialties. Mission Health has seven Centers of Excellence: Cancer, Heart, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, Trauma, Women's Health and Mission Children's Hospital, the region's only children's hospital...Other Mission Health member hospitals include Angel Medical Center in Franklin, Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine, Highlands-Cashiers Hospital in Highlands, McDowell Hospital in Marion and Transylvania Regional Hospital in Brevard.<br>
<br>
..Mission Hospital traces its roots to 1885, when a group of women calling themselves "The Little Flower Mission" saw a need for a hospital in Asheville that would care for those in need, regardless of their ability to pay. They raised funds by selling flowers on the streets of the city,[3] started their hospital in a rented five-room house on what is now Biltmore Avenue near Hilliard Avenue, and expanded and relocated four times in the next seven years.[4] By 1940, there were five small general hospitals in the city, but medical professionals had begun to see the need for a major medical center for western North Carolina.[5] In 1947, Mission Hospital merged with Clarence Barker Memorial Hospital (at that time known as<span style="color:#FF0040"> Biltmore Hospital), which was established by the All Soul's Parish in 1896 and constructed on land donated by George Vanderbilt</span>[6] and became Memorial Mission Hospital.<br>
<br>
Over time, Memorial Mission Hospital absorbed Victoria Hospital (formerly called Norburn Hospital, founded in 1928) and the Asheville Colored Hospital (founded in 1943). Memorial Mission Medical Center and St. Joseph's Hospital established an organizational partnership in 1996 and formally merged in 1998[8] as Mission-St. Joseph's Health System.<br>
<br>
St. Joseph's Hospital was established by the <span style="color:#FF0040">Sisters of Mercy</span> in 1900 as a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis..<br>
<br>
The $1.5 billion sale of Mission Health to the for-profit <span style="color:#FF0040">HCA Healthcare</span>, announced in March 2018, was completed February 1, 2019. [<em class="text-italics">In 2006, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</span> and Bain Capital, together with Merrill Lynch and the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $33.6 billion acquisition</em>]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..The upheaval at Warner was beneficial to its rivals, who picked up valuable executives who had left Warner. Goldberg moved over to Mercury Records; Morris joined MCA Music Entertainment Group and led its reorganization into Universal Music Group, now the world's largest record company. In November 1995, Fuchs was himself sacked by Levin, leaving the company with a reported US$60 million "golden parachute", and Time Warner co-chairmen Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel took over the running of the music division.[39][40][41]<br>
<br>
In 1998, <span style="color:#FF0040">Seagram boss Edgar Bronfman Jr.</span> held talks aimed at merging Seagram's Universal Music, headed by Morris, with the venerable British recording company EMI, but the discussions came to nothing; Bronfman then oversaw Universal's takeover by Vivendi. WEA meanwhile continued to expand its publishing empire, buying a 90% stake in the Italian recording and music publishing group Nuova Fonit Cetra..<br>
<br>
Looking to reduce its debt load, Time Warner—the corporate successor to Warner Communications—sold Warner Music Group in 2004 to a group of investors led by <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Edgar Bronfman Jr.</span></span> for US$2.6 billion. This spinoff was completed on February 27, 2004. In the 2004 transition to independent ownership, WMG hired record industry heavyweight Lyor Cohen from Universal Music Group (the result of the merger between the PolyGram and MCA label families) to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance.

Under the insistence of the record company the band re-recorded their early single "Temple of Love" with Ofra Haza on additional vocals<br>
<br>
Ofra Haza- Bat-Sheva Ofra Haza-Ashkenazi was an Israeli singer, actress and Grammy Award-nominee recording artist, commonly known as "The Israeli Madonna", or "Madonna of the East"..Ofra Haza died on February 23, 2000, at the age of 42, of AIDS-related pneumonia. ..<br>
<br>
...<em class="text-italics">it was Peres who invited Haza to sing at the signing of the Oslo Accord and at the Nobel Prize ceremony, during which he won a prize for "peace." Recalling that Peres was in charge of the Israeli atomic program during the days when the Yemenite children were kidnapped and turned into guinea pigs for atomic experiments, her appearance beside him was more than a little disconcerting...We all believe she was deliberately infected with AIDS.<br>
<br>
He took her everywhere. If Margaret Thatcher was in town, he'd bring her along to serenade her. I have a picture of that event. His affair with her began way before the 'peace' process. He saw her first movie, Ha Frekha, (The Tart), and he took a shine to her. Peres had a contact to the film's director, Pashanel, who died last year. He was Gideon Zinger. He's the father of Yoel Zinger, the lawyer who drew up the Declaration Of Principles with the PLO. That's how he got to meet Ofra. Peres is a serial cad, but at least he rewards his conquests with great careers. However, he really took advantage of her.<br>

<br>
Jack Parsons - After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952 Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or murder.<br>
<br>
One of Cameron's friends, the artist Renate Druks, later stated her belief that Parsons had died in a rite designed to create a homunculus.

Bryanston School is a co-educational independent school for both day and boarding pupils, located next to the village of Bryanston, and near the town of Blandford Forum, in Dorset in South West England. It was founded in 1928. It occupies a palatial country house designed and built in 1889–94 by Richard Norman Shaw, the champion of a renewed academic tradition, for Viscount Portman, the owner of large tracts in the West End of London, in the early version of neo-Georgian style[1] that<span style="color:#FF0040"> Sir Edwin Lutyens called "Wrenaissance"</span>, to replace an earlier house, and is set in 400 acres (1.6 km2).<br>
<br>
Bryanston is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the Eton Group.<br>
<br>
..During the mid-1930s, Bryanston School was the location of Anglo-German youth camps where the Hitler Youth and Boy Scouts tried to develop links..In 2005 the school was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel.<br>

Kenneth Anger: cosmology, Magick rituals and Aleister Crowley <a href="https://hero-magazine.com/article/171885/kenneth-anger-cosmologically-magick-rituals-and-aleister-crowley/" class="postlink">https://hero-magazine.com/article/17188 ... r-crowley/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Situated on the fringes of cinema yet as influential as any in the centre, Kenneth Anger’s work is not for the faint-hearted: it’s not some smooth ride in a plush cinema seat, it’s a grab-you-by-the-throat-and-tie-you-to-the-chair affair. But like most domineering experiences, you’re left with an instinctive craving for more.<br>
<br>
Writing about Anger’s life is somewhat difficult, blurred by drugs, rumours and Anger’s own bending of the truth, but his story begins in suburban middle-class Santa Monica, California, where he was already rubbing shoulders with the children of Hollywood’s elite: <span style="color:#FF0040">at the age of four he played the prince in Max Reinhardt’s 1935 adaptation of Midsummer Night’s Dream – alongside Mickey Rooney and James Cagney</span>, coincidentally – and a few years later he found himself partnered in a dance class with fading child star Shirley Temple. A fascination with Hollywood quickly evolved, yet Anger – as would become his raison d’etre – twisted it to suit his own devilish palette...<br>
<br>
Ten years in the making, Lucifer Rising (1972) is Anger’s masterstroke. Though barely half an hour-long, the work is an all-encompassing visual deep-end dive. Set within a visceral, technicolour vision of ancient Egypt, gods summon the angel Lucifer in order to usher in a new occult age, all the while traversing Icelandic volcanoes, the Pyramids of Giza, the ancient solar temples of Stonehenge and Externsteine in Germany...<br>
<br>
While the spectre of occultist Aleister Crowley looms large over Anger’s entire catalogue, Lucifer Rising takes clear reference from the teachings of Crowley’s religion, Thelema: it’s descriptions of Lucifer as the light-bearing god and an analogy of the coming Aeon of Horus directly reflects the Thelemic prophecy described in The Book of the Law.<br>
<br>
Dig deeper into the film’s back story and its subcultural weight is clear: it was set to star Mick Jagger as Lucifer, but while the singer eventually backed out following the ’69 Altamont incident, his then-girlfriend Marianne Faithfull did appear in the film as the demon Lilith; while the soundtrack was created by <span style="color:#FF0040">Bobby Beausoleil, a follower of Charles Manson who, having been convicted for murder in 1970, wrote most of the score in prison</span></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Tex Watson, rarely mentioned in stories, is convicted in a separate trial of all of the murders, he likely killed almost all of the victims....The origins of much of the violence associated with the Manson murders can be traced to Tex trying burn a high level weed dealer known as  Lotsapoppa or Bernard Crowe. ..<br>
<br>
Drugs also figure heavily throughout the oncoming darkness, and in the tale of the murder of Gary Hinman in late July 1969 that started things off in a really wrong direction. Once a friend of the Family, and roommate of Bobby Beausoleil for a while, he was rumored to have sold bad mescaline to Beausoleil, who sold it to a biker gang who claimed it bunk and wanted their money back. Beausoleil was in a bind, and he was in danger of a beating or worse, and needed to fix it..<br>
<br>
Satanic trappings had started to intersect the family early on in late 1967 at the famed Spiral Staircase house in Topanga canyon. A woman named Gina held increasingly frequent and increasingly weird parties there, and Manson and his small troupe of girls parked their ‘Holywood Productions’ black bus there and set up shop until the scene got uneasy. Manson himself had said that dark magical practices started to be commonplace there at a time when celebrities were starting to roll through the house, and it got too weird, even for him. (<span style="color:#FFFF40">this is where Bobby Beausoleil enters the tale, and his association with Kenneth Anger and his starring role in Lucifer’s Rising being filmed at the time is perhaps one of the ‘dark practices’ being referred to.</span>) In the mid 1960’s people were getting intrigued by the dark side of spirituality across California. The head of the Church of Satan Anton LaVey had made Satanism fashionable in the Hollywood scene. He was an adviser and played the Devil in Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby film. With Jayne Mansfield and Sammy Davis Jr openly preaching Satanism, it was easy to see Hollywood folks getting drawn deeper into weirdness they didn’t really understand. Oh, and Susan Atkins worked with Anton LaVey in a sensationalist Satan showpiece playing a topless blood drinking vampire before she met Manson. Pieces of the puzzle were beginning to draw together in an eerie fashion, and with occult themes as the glue binding them.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>They [at the Tate house] had fallen into sadism and masochism and bestiality—and they recorded it all on videotape, too. The L.A. police told me this. I know that three days before they were killed twenty-five people were invited to that house for a mass-whipping of a dealer from Sunset Strip who’d given them bad dope”</div></blockquote>–Dennis Hopper<br>
 <span style="color:#FF0040">“They were fucking pedophiles, they weren’t innocent.”</span> -Manson about Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski and Jay Sebring.<br>
<br>
In an interview with Truman Capote, Bobby Beausoleil said:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Who says they were innocent? They burned peo­ple on dope deals. Sharon Tate and that gang. <span style="color:#FF0040">They picked up kids on the Strip and took them home and whipped them. Made movies of it. Ask the cops; they found the movies</span>. Not that they’d tell you the truth.”</em><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Who were the Informants? The Hidden Power Brokers? Did the government really know what was going on?<br>
</span><br>
Yes, there were stand down orders from ‘someone above’ documented. How did Manson get arrested and let go so many times when he was out on bail unless he had a guardian angel somewhere fairly high up in the system watching over him? Charlie had meetings in Terminal Island with a lawyer before he got out. But for a career low level hoodlum, it was a very odd choice for a lawyer that wanted to meet with him. George Shibley. According to Mae Brassell– A prominent attorney by the name of George Shibley who works with groups in the Middle East (and Sirhan Sirhan)—in Beverly Hills he has powerful connections—met with Charles Manson just before he got out of jail in (Terminal) Island. No one will know what conversation transpired between Mr. Shibley [and Manson], or why he was up there. If this is accurate, why would Shibley have gone to see him? Did Manson have need for legal representation at that time? Was this a sign of some master plan for Charlie once he was out?..<br>
<br>
Charlie’s original probation officer Roger Smith was connected to the Family early on and also to Abigail Folger through the Free Clinic. Dr. Roger Smith, was a research criminologist who had launched the drug treatment program at the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic. <span style="color:#FFFF40">Dr. David Smith had founded the Free Clinic</span>, and in 1969 clinic administrator Al Rose spent months living/infiltrating the Manson Family before things grew dark. He brought his data back and with Smith, and together published a fairly famous paper on the Family: “The Group Marriage Commune: A Case Study,”.  Their probation officer and his wife were somehow allowed to be foster parents to Manson family toddlers whenever they were  busted, often, then give the kids back. That seems a bit ill advised for a hippie group with so many lingering negative associations. Manson being his only client makes this something quite anomalous.<br>
<br>
..The immediate disappearance of Winifred Chapman, Sharon and Roman’s trusted housekeeper–the first one to find the murder scene is generally unreported. Chapman is well known to most researchers, but few are aware of her oddly timed disappearance. She was a long term employee of the Polanskis, and privy to many of their secrets. So it is troubling that one never reads that she was reported missing on October 13th of 1969 by her landlord, and that she was last seen on October 10th. She left her purse and wallet with her ID in her room. Two weeks later she was still missing. The fact that she disappeared on the exact day the Manson family was arrested for good at the Barker ranch should make any investigator wonder if she was spirited away by officials or parties unknown for reasons unknown.  The Family were not yet suspects at this point, yet this is an odd coincidence.<br>
<br>
..One final note: I bought the original library bound edition of Rolling Stone magazine from summer 1970 which contained not just the massive Manson article issue, but a dozen subsequent issues. Now anyone familiar with Rolling Stone of that era knows that the letters section of the following issue is chock full of comments about the previous issue. Hell, if the news was big enough, letters sometimes were in the same issue as the news broke in. So I scanned the next issue for any mention in the letters of the Manson article. There were none. Odd. I checked the following issue. Still nothing. I kept searching the next five issues and not one single mention of the Manson article. Clearly this was intentional, but the big question is ‘why’? Obviously the magazine had been flooded with letters, but not a single one was published. This had to be an editorial decision by the publisher and editors at the highest levels. Who ordered this: law enforcement? Not likely they’d listen to that. Death threats from the Manson Family still at large? Far more likely. No one has ever mentioned this ‘non-event’-obviously it was never intended to be ever mentioned, and they must have just hoped nobody would notice. Definitely one of the strangest little tidbits of hidden information I’ve ever encountered in this case.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In classic gadabout form, Renate Druks is remembered as an ephemeral creature. Like Wallace Berman, she attracted a circle of remarkable people and forged connections between them. On her own, she was a painter, but even more acted as muse for so many others’ work.<br>
<br>
The capsule biographies always start, “studied painting in Vienna,” and skip to, “lived in Malibu” with little in between. She was born in Vienna on January 2, 1921 (if you are interested in her horoscope). We know nothing of her mother. Her father was a doctor, perhaps a psychiatrist. Her past is murky, like a smeared charcoal drawing, erased on purpose.<br>
<br>
Anais Nin was a longtime friend, and Druks was a muse for two peculiar little books written by Nin later in her career, Portrait in Three Dimensions, and Collages.<br>
<br>
In Portrait she writes:<br>
“Renate’s father treated her like a confidante, a friend. . . He discussed her mother with her as if Renate was a woman, and explained that it was her mother’s constant depression which drove him away from home.”<br>
<br>
Nin also writes that Renate’s father told her, “No man will love you as much as I do.” Handicapping her psyche for life....<br>
<br>
..In the book The Occult Explosion (Nat Freedland, 1972), Renate is quoted, “Cameron stayed with me at my Malibu beach house for six months, pulling herself together after Jack [Parsons] died.” That is, the Jack Parsons of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who blew himself or was blown up by evil spirits, or the government, or anti-Zionists. Take your pick.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Renate says of her occult study, “I was never really a witch, but I did study magic for a while . . . I took it up mostly in self-defense; there were some scary things going on at Malibu Beach in the late fifties.”..<br>
<br>
During these years she was embroiled in a relationship with Paul Mathison, a gay artist whose only traces today are the titles he designed for two Kenneth Anger films, and some futuristic furniture. They lived together at her Malibu place where they threw infamous and complicated theme parties.<br>
<br>
Around 1954 one of these parties proffered the theme, “Come as Your Madness,” in which the bit was to dress as an alter ego of oneself. Kenneth Anger was sparked by the concept, and took the frame to build his Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Guests at the party and their costumes became the cast of the film: Curtis Harrington as Cesare from Cabinet of Caligari, Cameron as the Scarlet Woman, Paul Mathison as Pan, Anais Nin as Astarte, and gadabout incarnate, Samson De Brier, as everyone else.<br>
<br>
Druks designed the make-up and was “Lillith.” She is the woman with the red hair and broad laughing face turned skeleton face after ingesting the magic potion. She is the most graceful presence in the film, the only one to truly look as if she is in a heightened state.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The "Wisconsin Idea"is a public philosophy that has influenced policy and ideals in the U.S. state of Wisconsin's education system and politics. In education, emphasis is often placed on how the Idea articulates education's role for Wisconsin's government and inhabitants. In politics, the Idea is most associated with the historic political upheaval and subsequent reformation during the Progressive Era in the United States...<br>
<br>
First articulated in the educational sense in 1904 when University of Wisconsin-Madison President Charles Van Hise declared he would "never be content until the beneficent influence of the university reaches every family in the state", the Wisconsin Idea has been used to frame and foster the public universities contributions to the state of Wisconsin's government and citizens: "to the government in the forms of serving in office, offering advice about public policy, providing information and exercising technical skill, and to the citizens in the forms of doing research directed at solving problems that are important to the state and conducting outreach activities".[2]<br>
<br>
In the strictly political sense, the Idea came about during the Progressive Era when proponents of the Wisconsin Idea took <span style="color:#FF0040">inspiration from traditions and customs bought to the state by German Americans.</span> These progressives saw U.S. states as "laboratories for democracy" ready for experimentation. This resulted in a genetive legislative environment that implemented numerous significant reforms including to primary elections, workers' compensation, state and federal transportation, U.S. Senate elections, and progressive taxation that served as a model for other states and the federal government.[4] The modern political facet of the philosophy is the effort "to ensure well-constructed legislation aimed at benefiting the greatest number of people".</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As it may fairly be said that war is the father of technological invention, it is also true<br>
that in the liberal democracies of the Western world, politics fathers public relations. The<br>
rhetorical arms race of political PR vitalizes the entire spectrum of persuasive<br>
communication. My presentation takes account of the political philosophy of the first modern<br>
theorist, Abraham Lincoln, which he succinctly expressed in his statement, "He who moulds<br>
public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He makes<br>
statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed." The new birth of freedom he<br>
prophesized at Gettysburg depended in no small part upon the role of the media as an<br>
indispensable fourth estate -- a conviction that resonated with the role of a free press foreseen<br>
by the Founders.<br>
 It did not, however, anticipate the collateral consequences of mass audiences for mass<br>
media over the following decades. The opposite end of Abraham's arc bends toward the<br>
"manufactured consent" that Walter Lippmann warned of in Liberty and the News (1920):<br>
"[M]en are conscious that somehow they must deal with questions more intricate than any<br>
that church or school had prepared them to understand. Increasingly they know that they<br>
cannot understand them if the facts are not quickly and steadily available. Increasingly they<br>
are baffled because the facts are not available; and they are wondering whether government<br>
by consent can survive in a time when the manufacture of consent is an unregulated private<br>
enterprise."<br>
 Traveling along that arc (looking for a wrong turn?) we find the Progressive reformer,<br>
Governor Bob La Follette of Wisconsin, who recognized at the turn of the century that the<br>
challenge of reforming the financial, industrial and commercial realms required an informed<br>
citizenry who could trust the experts to provide meaningful options for democratic<br>
deliberation. <span style="color:#FF0040">La Follette's "Wisconsin idea" deployed the state university system in the<br>
training of a generation of what he called "publicists," who could translate the complexities<br>
of banking, land speculation, railroads, oil and steel -- the entire repertoire of the robber<br>
barons -- into manageable, voteable political choices in which all (men) could participate. </span><br>
<br>
As the historian Katherine H. Adams has written, "The vision of a Progressive society<br>
posited a more powerful and active citizenry who would need information to pursue reform.<br>
To chart the future wisely, the populace would need guidance from trained communicators....<br>
By 1910, Progressive universities would be providing these mind-molders, taste-formers, and<br>
idea-suggesters through specialized courses and majors in journalism, public relations,<br>
advertising, public speaking, creative writing, film, and business and technical writing."<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040"> The original “publicists” -- the muckrakers -- came first. Lee and Bernays were the<br>
response</span>, and Lippmann’s concerns were ultimately justified. Adams cites Eric Goldman:<br>
"The muckrakers used publicity as an anti-business weapon ... industry, in direct reply to the<br>
muckrakers, began to feel that if publicity could be used against them, it could be used for<br>
them. Hence the birth of the whole public relations industry."<br>
 This genealogy of public relations provides a fresh perspective that bridges the evolution<br>
of “public sentiment” in an industrial democracy, and helps to illuminate current dilemmas of <br>
an ill-informed body politic.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The cornerstone of Lause’s contention that spiritualism and Republicanism formed part of the same intellectual current is his treatment of Abraham Lincoln. His chapter on Lincoln demonstrates beyond doubt that the president was more than a dabbler in the spiritual arts; he made multiple personal connections with those in the spiritualist community. ..<br>
<br>
One does not have to buy the story of Lincoln being levitated on a grand piano to grasp why spiritualists saw in the president a kindred spirit. “Lincoln actually retained a vast residue of folk beliefs,” Lause concludes, “sharing many of the fundamental assumptions of spiritualism”<br>
(146). Spiritualists viewed Lincoln himself as a mediator—a medium in<br>
the political sphere—positioned between the founders of the nation and<br>
the struggle of the Civil War. When Lincoln invoked “the mystic chords<br>
of memory” in his First Inaugural Address, spiritualists perceived a<br>
friend. ..<br>
<br>
As the flame of Radical Republicanism flickered out, spirit voices became whispers. Still, in<br>
his final chapter Lause traces the subterranean survival of elements of<br>
the spiritualist impulse in the organization of the “Order of Eternal Progress,” in the <span style="color:#FF0040">Theosophical Society</span>, in Victoria Woodhull’s following, and even in Edward Bellamy’s novel Looking Backward, 2000–1887. <br>

Readers accustomed to conceiving of the New Deal in Iowa entirely in terms of thoughtful technocrats,<br>
beleaguered farmers, and empowered workers will be in for a surprise.<br>
Harrington’s study shows that the politics of alcohol did not disappear<br>
with the repeal of Prohibition. As a work of journalism history, the book<br>
also serves as a case study of the perils of checkbook journalism..<br>

<em class="text-italics">Wisconsin on the Air: 100 Years of Public Broadcasting in the State That Invented It</em>, by Jack Mitchell. Madison: Wisconsin State Historical Society Press, 2016. xi, 226 pp.<br>
<br>
..Jack Mitchell, the first producer for National Public Radio’s (NPR) All Things Considered, has compiled an informative and entertaining chronology of Wisconsin Public Broadcasting, an institution he helped shape as director of Wisconsin Public Radio for more than two decades from 1976 to 1997..The book is divided into two sections. The first half treats the first<br>
50 years of what the author labels educational broadcasting. The second part covers the era of public broadcasting made possible with the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and financial support for noncommercial stations. ..The tale begins with a nearly inaudible piano melody flowing from<br>
a receiver speaker in the living room of University of Wisconsin physicist Earle Terry in 1917. By all accounts, the guests listening in Terry’s home were not impressed. Certainly they had no reason to believe they<br>
had witnessed the historic origin of what would become one of the nation’s foremost public broadcasting operations.<br>
The University of Wisconsin saw the new medium as a vehicle for spreading the institution’s <span style="color:#FF0040">Wisconsin Idea</span>, a commitment to its educational mission to extend progressive ideas from the campus to homes across the state. Mitchell argues that the academic origin of radio continues to influence contemporary public broadcasting.</div></blockquote></div>
