Before I can fully get to that story I have to painstakingly make a number of smaller posts (like this one) as pieces of the puzzle before putting them all together..</span></em><br>
<br>
So Ivermectin is the latest 'wonder drug' being marketed to the alternative community in order to get perfectly healthy people to medicate themselves and to further create divisions between the vaccinated population and those who won't...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Big day today - the FLCCC Alliance Ivermectin manuscript had its expert peer-review accepted for publication! Sanity reigns.. Note the paper concludes that ivermectin should be immediately &amp; globally deployed in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 - hope the world listens <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

That tweet from <span style="color:#00FF40">Dr. Pierre Kory</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Kory" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Kory</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pierre Kory is an American critical care physician who gained attention during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for advocacy of unproven treatments of COVID-19. Kory again made controversial statements during Senate testimony on December 8, 2020 for advocacy of ivermectin, particularly for characterizing it as "miraculous"..<br>
<br>
In 2002, Kory graduated from St. George's University with an MD and completed residency and fellowship training in critical care and pulmonary medicine.[3] He did clinical rotations at the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Weill Cornell School of Medicine</span>.<br>
<br>
Kory first practised in<span style="color:#FFFF40"> Madison, WI at UW Health, which is the academic medical center at the University of Wisconsin</span>. He served there as the medical director for the Trauma and Life Support Center, in the outpatient pulmonary medicine clinic, and performed bronchoscopic and pleural procedures.<br>
<br>
Kory was in May 2020 "Critical Care Service Chief" at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. In May 2020, Kory resigned from UW Health after his public participation as a guest of Senator Ron Johnson at a hearing in which he called for use of steroids in COVID-19 patients..Kory then joined Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center in Milwaukee, WI. After his participation in a 8 December 2020 meeting[6] of the Senate Homeland Security Committee in which he expounded the benefits of ivermectin for COVID-19,[7][1][2] he resigned from Aurora St Luke's, telling a reporter the hospital wanted to limit his freedom to speak.</div></blockquote>

In passing.. I just want to point out that there is another Pierre Kory on Twitter.. The reasons for recording this will be explained in a future post.. but for now <a href="https://twitter.com/praticien" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/praticien</a> the account describes itself as a humanitarian doctor from Geneva.. follows many UN agencies.. last tweeted in 2016.  4 followers.  The first follower of that account has this as a pinned tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/IamPearlita/status/1340278692304605184" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/IamPearlita/status/ ... 2304605184</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Publisher’s Word: “The virus can’t infect you, can’t replicate, and can’t kill you if you’re on Ivermectin,” Dr. Pierre Kory <a href="https://megadoctornews.com/publishers-word-the-virus-cant-infect-you-cant-replicate-and-cant-kill-you-if-youre-on-ivermectin-dr-pierre-kory/" class="postlink">https://megadoctornews.com/publishers-w ... erre-kory/</a> via MegaDoctor</div></blockquote>

So, that article is about our Wisconsin doctor and his 2 colleagues: <span style="color:#FF8040">Dr. Joe Varon and Dr. Paul Marik</span> .<br>
<br>
I'll get to them later but let's take a closer look at Ivermectin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ivermectin is a medication used to treat many types of parasite infestations.[3] In humans, this includes head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis, and lymphatic filariasis.[3][4][5][6] In veterinary medicine, it is used to prevent and treat heartworm and acariasis, among other indications.[5] It can be taken by mouth or applied to the skin for external infestations...It belongs to the avermectin family of medications<br>
<br>
..The avermectin family of compounds was discovered by <span style="color:#FFFF40">Satoshi Ōmura of Kitasato University and William Campbell of Merck</span>. In 1970, Ōmura isolated unusual Streptomyces bacteria from the soil near a golf course along the south east coast of Honshu, Japan [at Kawana].<br>
<br>
Adverse effects: The main concern is neurotoxicity, which in most mammalian species may manifest as central nervous system depression, and consequent ataxia, as might be expected from potentiation of inhibitory GABA-ergic synapses.

Dr. Joe Varon aka the "Covid Hunter" of Houston <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-53576427" class="postlink">https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-53576427</a>  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/nob83i.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Strangely enough there is a device called <span style="color:#FF0040">the Covid Hunter</span> too <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/business/article/Covid-Hunter-the-scanner-that-detects-15912631.php" class="postlink">https://www.ctpost.com/business/article ... 912631.php</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It is now possible to detect the coronavirus without testing, thanks to the Covid Hunter device, a scanner that identifies the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus immediately. The developers describe it as "the world's first non-contact viral detector" and will be manufactured in Mexico ... developed by the American company<span style="color:#FFFF40"> Advanced Medical Solutions International (AMSI)</span> </div></blockquote>

They are basically a stem cell research company: <a href="https://us-amsi.com/" class="postlink">https://us-amsi.com/</a><br>

..Undoubtedly, AmeriCares has done plenty of aid work around the world, including aid to help survivors of Hurricane Sandy. But with their links to the Knights of Malta (originally known as the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John), they have achieved a certain "diplomatic immunity," moving from nation to nation. This, of course, became very helpful for the U.S. intelligence community, especially when guys like former CIA director William Casey (during the Reagan administration) was even a member of the Knights.

Besides its links to the former CIA director, AmeriCares' board includes his brother Prescott Bush, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, former U.S. Secretary of State Zbigniew Brzezinski, General Colin Powell, and former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.

In 2009, he was appointed a Commander Brother of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem by HM Queen Elizabeth II..<br>

A former president of and director of the St. Louis-based Boatmen's Bancshares from 1978 to 1986, Bush was active in various St. Louis civic functions: he was chairman of the Board of Trustees of Saint Louis University from 1985 to 1992, chairman of the Missouri Botanical Garden from 1991 to 1993 and president of the Municipal Opera Association from 2005 to 2006.[6] He was also a director of Maritz, Inc, and served on the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri board of directors from 1989 to 1994.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>George Herbert Walker was born on June 11, 1875 in St. Louis, Missouri. Walker was descended from a Maryland family of slave owners.[4] His great-grandfather Thomas Walker was a British slave trader. He was the youngest son of David Davis Walker, a dry goods merchant from Bloomington, Illinois, and Martha Adela (Beaky). Ely, Walker &amp; Company, which grew into a leading regional wholesaler, was later acquired by Burlington Industries.<br>
<br>
Walker was educated at Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit boarding school in England. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 1897.<br>
<br>
Walker started a banking and investment firm named G.H. Walker &amp; Co. in 1900.[5] His family had developed many international banking contacts, and he helped organize the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. <span style="color:#FF0040">Walker was known as the power behind the local Democratic Party.</span><br>
<br>
In 1920, Walker became the President of the W.A. Harriman &amp; Co. investment firm, and quickly arranged the credits that W. Averell Harriman needed to take control of the Hamburg-Amerika Line. Walker also organized the American Ship and Commerce Corp. to be subsidiary of the W.A. Harriman &amp; Co., with contractual power over the affairs of the Hamburg-Amerika. W.A. Harriman &amp; Co. (renamed Harriman Brothers &amp; Company in 1927) well-positioned for this enterprise and rich in assets from their German and Russian business, merged with the British-American investment house Brown Bros. &amp; Co. on January 1, 1931. Walker retired to his own G.H. Walker &amp; Co. This left the Harriman brothers, his son-in-law Prescott Bush and Thatcher M. Brown as senior partners of the new firm of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. The firm's London branch continued operating under its historic name Brown, Shipley &amp; Co.<br>
<br>
Walker was a director of the W.A. Harriman &amp; Company; Harriman Fifteen, American International Corporation; Georgian Manganese Corporation; Barnsdall Corporation; American Ship &amp; Commerce Corporation; Union Banking Corporation; G.H. Walker &amp; Company; Missouri Pacific Railroad; Laclede Gas and the New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railroad.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>An interview with Dr. Tess Lawrie. We discuss the ongoing saga surrounding her meta-analysis on Ivermectin studies for the safety and efficacy against Covid-19. We also touch on the FDA recent announcement cautioning against the use of the drug, <span style="color:#FFFF40">and Dr. Andrew Hill</span>.<br>

Dr. Lawrie is the director of E-BMC Ltd. and is committed to improving the quality of healthcare through rigorous research.

<br>
Website: <a href="https://www.e-bmc.co.uk/" class="postlink">https://www.e-bmc.co.uk/</a></div></blockquote>

Lawrie says that Dr Hill published a review of the drug which showed its effects caused a 75% reduction in deaths, yet the conclusion of his report was that large scale trials were needed and that regulatory bodies could not approve use of the medication until all these studies were done. When she contacted him to find out why there was a mismatch between the data and the report's conclusions he told her that the conclusion were not his own but were influenced by  his sponsors &gt; Unitaid.<br>
<br>
Andrew Hill's wiki page was deleted today. From the wayback machine: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210311210918/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hill_%28pharmacologist%29" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20210311210 ... acologist)</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Andrew Hill is a senior visiting Research Fellow in the Pharmacology Department at Liverpool University. He graduated from Oxford University, and later completed a PhD at Amsterdam University. ..<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">He is also an advisor to the Clinton Foundation and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</span>, designing clinical trial programmes of dose optimisation for antiretrovirals. <br>

Well, if dogs supposedly can sniff out covid I guess the next development was going to be the covid detector "gun"<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..The dogs may even be able to detect false negative tests. During the testing, two samples collected from individuals who tested negative were repeatedly marked by the dogs. The relevant hospitals were informed, and in subsequent tests these individuals tested positive....<br>
<br>
..In addition, a surgeon and researcher at Saint Joseph University in Beirut, Riad Sarkis, further tested the best two performers by taking them to a Lebanese airport. <br>
<br>
..This may be especially helpful for those asymptomatic COVID cases in which a person is infected with SARS-CoV-2 but doesn’t realize it because they don’t have any of the symptoms. In fact, the Miami Heat had already begun to use dogs to screen fans before games. </div></blockquote>

Mercury, I was working off memory mentioning that German line and my memory isn't so good these days, but you sparked some research I'd done on it in the past.  TUI rings a bell. Not sure if I had saved any of my research since it was some time back, but will fire up my other laptop for a go see.  If I find anything I certainly will post it.  As I recall, I could not make any connection Madam Adam or I'd have been all over it.</div>
