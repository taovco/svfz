			<div class="content">I'm trying to solve a puzzle by putting together a series of posts that look at some of the scientific work and political machinations of the military and intelligence services.  Further to <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2141" class="postlink"><span style="color:#00FF40">Remote Control of Human Behaviour - DREADDs</span></a>, in this post I return to the history of the military-industrial complex's work on radio waves.<br>
<br>
Why the US Navy once wanted to turn Wisconsin into the world's largest antenna <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8381983/project-sanguine" class="postlink">https://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8381983/project-sanguine</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In the 1960s, US Navy officials concocted an ambitious plan: they wanted to bury a gigantic grid of cables under roughly 41 percent of the state of Wisconsin in order to turn its bedrock into the world's largest radio antenna. The plan was called <span style="color:#FFFF40">Project Sanguine</span>. And though it sounds crazy, it was a logical — albeit impractical — way of communicating with deep-sea submarines around the world. The problem was that radio waves don't travel well through water, so there was no good way to send signals to the nuclear-powered subs that stayed submerged for months at a time during the Cold War. Project Sanguine would have been an antenna for transmitting extremely low-frequency (ELF) waves that can penetrate water and reach the subs.<br>
<br>
It  never happened, largely because of the huge cost (potentially billions of dollars) and environmental disturbance it would have required. But a much smaller version — called Project ELF — was eventually built in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and operated <a href="https://archive.is/FGV6q" class="postlink"><span style="color:#40FF40">between 1989 and 2004</span>.</a></div></blockquote>

HAARP, ELF Generation, and Mass Mind Control <a href="https://archive.is/nx7tM" class="postlink">https://archive.is/nx7tM</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>ELF waves up to 100 Hz are once more naturally occurring, but they can also be produced artificially (such as for the Navy’s Project Sanguine for submarine communication). ELF-waves are not normally noticed by the unaided senses, yet their resonant effect upon the human body has been connected to both physiological disorders and emotional distortion. Infrasound vibration (up to 20 Hz) can subliminally influence brain activity to align itself to delta, theta, alpha, or beta wave patterns, inclining an audience toward everything from alertness to passivity. Infrasound could be used tactically, as ELF-waves endure for great distances; and it could be used in conjunction with media broadcasts as well.<br>

..Title: <strong class="text-strong">Russian parliament concerned about US plans to develop new weapon Document Number: FBIS-SOV-2002-0808 Document Date: 08 Aug 2002</strong> <em class="text-italics">Division: Russia, North America Subdivision: Russia, United States Sourceline: CEP20020808000087 Moscow Interfax in English 1009 GMT 8 Aug 02 Citysource: Moscow Interfax Language: English [FBIS Transcribed Text] MOSCOW. Aug 8 (Interfax)</em> - The Russian State Duma has expressed concern about the United States' program to develop a qualitatively new type of weapon. "Under the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP), the U.S. is creating new integral geophysical weapons that may influence the near-Earth medium with high-frequency radio waves," the State Duma said in an appeal circulated on Thursday. ... The committees reported that the U.S. is planning to test three facilities of this kind. One of them is located on the military testing ground in Alaska and its full-scale tests are to begin in early 2003. The second one is in Greenland and the third one in Norway. "When these facilities are launched into space from Norway, Alsaka and Greenland, a closed contour will be created with a truly fantastic integral potential for influencing the near-Earth medium," the State Duma said. The U.S. plans to carry out large-scale scientific experiments, under the HAARP program, and not controlled by the global community, will create weapons capable of breaking radio communication lines and equipment installed on spaceships and rockets, provoke serious accidents in electricity networks and in oil and gas pipelines and have a negative impact on the mental health of people populating entire regions, the deputies said.

<span style="color:#00FF40">The Alta Summit, December 1984</span> <a href="https://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/alta.shtml" class="postlink">https://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/ ... alta.shtml</a><br>
<br>
..Many historical threads in the fabric that later became the Human Genome Project wind through that meeting, although it was not a meeting on mapping or sequencing the human genome. Through happenstance and historical accident, A<span style="color:#FFFF40">lta links human genome projects to research on the effects of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki</span> 40 years earlier. If genome projects prove important to biology, then historians will note the Alta meeting.<br>
<br>
The Alta meeting was sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the International Commission for Protection Against Environmental Mutagens and Carcinogens. It was initiated by David Smith of DOE and Mortimer Mendelsohn of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</span>, who turned over final organization to Raymond White of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</span> at the University of Utah.<br>
<br>
The purpose was to ask those working on the front lines of DNA analytical methods to address a specific technical question: <span style="color:#FFFF40">could new methods permit direct detection of mutations, and more specifically could any increase in the mutation rate among survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings be detected (in them or in their children)?</span> The idea behind the Alta meeting came from another meeting on March 4 and 5, 1984, in Hiroshima, at which new DNA analytical tools were deemed second highest priority for human mutations research, just behind establishing cell lines from atomic bomb survivors, their progeny, and controls. Those attending the Alta meeting in December (see Table 1) were drawn from a variety of backgrounds, and many had never met each other. Most said in interviews later that they came to the meeting quite skeptical, but left thinking it had been one of the best scientific meetings they ever attended (Interviews, 1987, 1988).<br>

The principal conclusion of the meeting was, ironically, that methods were incapable of measuring mutations with sufficient sensitivity, unless an enormously large, complex, and expensive program were undertaken. Technical obstacles thus thwarted attainment of the main goal of the meeting, yet the meeting left a profusion of new ideas in its wake, some of which later washed ashore to be incorporated into various genome projects. Five years later, there is still no sensitive assay for human heritable mutations, but there are genome programs at NIH, at DOE, and in several foreign nations.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 2019, Dr. Caskey took up a new role as Chief Medical Officer of <span style="color:#FFFF40">Human Longevity</span>, a medical technology company based in San Diego, using artificial intelligence to prevent diseases associated with aging.</div></blockquote>

Human Longevity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Longevity" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Longevity</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Human Longevity is a San Diego-based venture launched by Craig Venter and Peter Diamandis in 2013. Its goal is to build the world's most comprehensive database on human genotypes and phenotypes, and then subject it to machine learning so that it can help develop new ways to fight diseases associated with aging.[1] The company received US$80 million in investments in its Series A offering in summer 2014 and announced a further $220 million Series B investment offering in April 2016.[2] <span style="color:#FFFF40">It has made deals with drug companies Celgene and AstraZeneca to collaborate in its research.</span><br>
<br>
At the start of 2017, the company hired Cynthia Collins from GE Healthcare, and Venter became Executive Chair. The company's chief operating officer, Mark Winham, left the company in mid-2017, and Collins and the company's chief medical officer, Brad Perkins, left in December. Venter stepped back into the CEO role, but announced in May 2018 that he was leaving the company to return to the J. Craig Venter Institute.[5] <span style="color:#FFFF40">Venter was sued for allegedly 'stealing trade secrets' at Human Longevity</span>.[6] The case has been dismissed<br>
<br>
In 2018, according to The Wall Street Journal, "the company's valuation has declined 80 percent, from a $1.6 billion peak to $310 million" and "the company’s employee count has dropped from 300 workers in 2016 to 150" in 2018</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In the short clip Morgan says that in his view 'the work of Dr Craig Venter is the equivalent of the development of nuclear weapons when you realize that he created Life in a cell.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Born to a wealthy family in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Crowley rejected his parents' fundamentalist Christian <span style="color:#FFFF00">Plymouth Brethren</span> faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism.</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
[Funnily enough the Plymouth Brethren are the same order that Charlie Ward grew up with.]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>He was educated at Trinity College at the <span style="color:#FFFF40">University of Cambridge (1895-1898)</span>, where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency, further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898, he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett. ..<br>
<br>
.. At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershon's evangelical Christian boarding school in Hastings, and then to Ebor preparatory school in Cambridge, run by the Reverend Henry d'Arcy Champney, whom Crowley considered a sadist..
</div></blockquote>

Crowley returned to Hastings later in life where he ended his days.<br>

Hastings: birthplace of TV  <a href="https://lovehastings.com/hastings-the-birthplace-of-television/" class="postlink">https://lovehastings.com/hastings-the-b ... elevision/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hastings is best known for the famous Norman invasion, but did you know that it was also the birthplace of television?<br>
<br>
In 1922, John Logie Baird set up residence in Linton Crescent in Hastings, following a bout of illness. As a student, Baird had already experimented with the idea of television, however it was during his time in Hastings that he was able to develop and investigate the idea further. After appealing for help in The Times, Baird was approached by the BBC, who supported his quest to invent the television. By the end of 1923, Baird had successful transmitted a shadowy image with the receiver and transmitter still connected.<br>
<br>
In 1924, Baird was thrown across his workshop by a 1200v shock, which left him with burnt hands and a damaged apparatus. Unfortunately, this incident led to Baird being evicted and returning to London. It is clear that while the first true transmitted image took place in Soho, it would not have been possible without the groundwork that was established by Baird during his time in Hastings.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Interesting because in the UK, Hastings on the south coastline is known as the birthplace of television. It is also known as an area with much occult practictioners. Aleister Crowley died there too. <a href="http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/125th-birthday-of-the-inventor-of-television-john-logie-baird-1-5436074" class="postlink">http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/ ... -1-5436074</a><br>
<br>
[comment from carmencita] Yes, there is even a museum of sorts in Rigby dedicated to him. There is some really weird stuff going on with all this. Liverpool is a Cesspool and somehow Rigby is connected. John Lennon lived with his Uncle George TooGood Smith who bestowed too many kisses and time putting him to bed every night according to the wife. His Uncle is also buried in the cemetery. They lived in Mandip house on Manlove St. Too many signs in Liverpool, imo. Where was Gray taking that sand and for what? Is sand used for bombs or explosives?</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">So, Crowley was at Cambridge between 1895 and 1898. In 1898 he joined Golden Dawn. By then he was probably in contact with the intelligence services.<br>
<br>
Another esoteric group were making waves at that time too. The Theosophists..<br>
<br>
Neo-Theosophy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Theosophy" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Theosophy</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The term Neo-Theosophy is a term, originally derogatory, used by the followers of Blavatsky to denominate the system of Theosophical ideas expounded by <span style="color:#FFFF40">Annie Besant and Charles Webster Leadbeater</span> following the death of Madame Blavatsky in 1891.<br>
<br>
After Blavatsky died in 1891, William Quan Judge became involved in a dispute with Henry Steel Olcott and Annie Besant over Judge allegedly forging letters from the Mahatmas. As a result, he ended his association with Olcott and Besant during 1895 and took most of the Society's American Section with him. He managed his new organization for about a year until his death in New York City, whereupon Katherine Tingley became manager. The organization originating from the faction of Olcott and Besant is based in India and known as the Theosophical Society - Adyar, while the organization managed by Judge is known nowadays simply as the Theosophical Society, but often with the specification, "international headquarters, Pasadena, California."<br>
<br>
The Theosophical Society - Adyar is the group denounced as Neo-Theosophy by those who are followers of William Q. Judge and the original teachings of Madame Blavatsky; they do not accept what they regard as the Neo-Theosophical teachings of Annie Besant, Henry Olcott, and C. W. Leadbeater.<br>
<br>
The term <em class="text-italics">Neo-Theosophy</em> was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912 in a book called <em class="text-italics">Neo Theosophy Exposed</em>, the second part of an earlier book called <em class="text-italics">The Theosophical Society and its Esoteric Bogeydom</em>.[1] Around 1924, Margaret Thomas published a book called <em class="text-italics">Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy</em>. This book, now available online,[2] presents a detailed critical comparison of Blavatskyian Theosophy and Neo-Theosophy. ..<br>
<br>
The author Daryl S. Paulson associates "Neo-Theosophy" with Alice Bailey..Other neo-Theosophists include Steiner's contemporary Peter Deunov and Samael Aun Weor, who introduced theosophical teachings to Latin America. Dion Fortune and <span style="color:#FF0040">Aleister Crowley were also influencers of (and influenced by) the leading edge of the theosophical movement, which in turn influenced Anton LaVey's Satanism, L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, Wicca, and the modern New Age and New Thought movements. </span>(Alice Bailey introduced the term New Age)</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Vegan diet is anti-scientific. not just because of evolution but also because it causes severe nutritional deficiencies that cause death. Veganism causes B12, D and other micro and macromineral deficiencies. Part of it is because of how we grow food, but the other part of it is a fact that we are omnivores that require eating meat to obtain certain required nutrients B12 and D being those.<br>
<br>
You won't hear this from anyone else, but I've done deep autist-level research on vegan diet and the roots of it are with a group lucis trust, formerly lucifer trust and 2 occultist: <span style="color:#FFFF40">CW Leadbeater who wrote vegetarianism and occultism</span>, a 1918 book which I listened to on audiobook for free via Librivox (they have normal people read public domain books). Here's that book<br>

<a href="https://www.anandgholap.net/Vegetarianism_And_Occultism-CWL.htm" class="postlink">https://www.anandgholap.net/Vegetariani ... sm-CWL.htm</a><br>
<br>
[Alice] Bailey who formed the Lucifer Trust an NGO governance group that promoted occultism and theosophy used a lot of Leadbeaters work--they were very close contemporaries and influences of each other. They promoted the VEGAN diet, but it was just called vegetarian then. Lucis Trust (formerly lucifer trust) is a FOUNDING member of the UN and continues to this day AFAIK.<br>
<br>
..I'm saying that the Deepstate Ruling class families are mercantile globalist fascists very much like the Nazi party in early 20th century germany who believe in occultism. This started with "Spiritualism" and "seances" run by con artists that targetted the upper class in the turn of the 20th century in both the US, UK as well as in Germany. You know of this from movies and books. This actually happened. It started with fakes running seances to talk to the dead. Very smart and powerful people got deep into this</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It’s now known that during the first two decades of the 20th century, Anthony Mann was raised in a bizarre utopian commune known as “Lomaland,” run by the Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society. It was located on 350 acres of Point Loma, a peninsula bordering San Diego Bay.<br>
<br>
Shurlock’s bulwark against homosexuality is especially interesting when one considers that Katherine Tingley’s most aggressive weapon against her great rival in the Theosophical world, Annie Besant, head of the Adyar Society, was propaganda, widely distributed in a series of tracts, that denigrated Besant for the continued support within her organization of <span style="color:#FFFF40">reputed pederast Charles Webster Leadbeater</span>. <br>
<br>

<br>
..In the late 1920s, Besant travelled to the United States with her protégé and adopted son Jiddu Krishnamurti, who she claimed was the new Messiah and incarnation of Buddha. Krishnamurti rejected these claims in 1929.</div></blockquote>

Krishnamurti later rejected the Theosophists..</div>

			<div class="content">Krishnamurti had a a wealthy benefactress, American Mary Melissa Hoadley Dodge, who was domiciled in England<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Melissa_Hoadley_Dodge" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Meli ... dley_Dodge</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>She was the daughter of Sarah Tappan Hoadley (August 16, 1832 - January 10, 1909) and William Earl Dodge, Jr. (1832-1903) from New York. The family wealth came from a mercantile business that developed into one of the largest copper mining and copper wire manufacturing companies in America called Phelps, Dodge &amp; Co...Mary was one of six children and she, like her sister Grace Hoadley Dodge (1856-1914), remained unmarried and lived with her parents for several years. To seek some independence, Mary moved to London, England. Her father supported her decision, and purchased a house for her in Brompton Square, where she lived with a female companion from New York named Julia Fairchild Schreiner (1864-1953)<br>
<br>
Dodge moved from Brompton Square to the more fashionable Eaton Square, and then to <span style="color:#FFFF40">Warwick House in the precincts of St James’s Palace</span>.[2] She also had a residence named West Side House, located on West Side, Wimbledon Common, in south-west London. She was well-connected in London society, and corresponded with authors, artists and others including Lord Baden-Powell, Henry James and John Singer Sargent and architect Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens.<br>
<br>
Dodge gained a new companion at Warwick House, Countess Muriel De La Warr (née Muriel Agnes Brassey) (1872-1930)[5] (daughter of Lord Thomas Brassey), who had divorced her husband Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr in 1902. Lady Emily Lutyens (1874-1964),[6] architect Edwin Lutyens' wife, introduced Mary and Muriel to Theosophy and to the works of Annie Besant (1847-1933). <span style="color:#FFFF40">Dodge provided financial support for the Theosophical Society and for the construction of its London headquarters (designed by Edwin Lutyens) in Tavistock Square</span>. <span style="color:#FF0040">The building is now BMA House, the headquarters of the British Medical Association. </span> When in England during the period 1911-1919, the Krishnamurti brothers lodged in quite a few different places, including with Mary Dodge at West Side House, and in lodgings provided by Muriel De La Warr in 2 different locations: sometimes <span style="color:#FFFF40">Old Lodge in Ashdown Forest, Sussex</span>, and sometimes a flat at No. 2 Robert Street, Adelphi, London. In 1913 Dodge settled £500 per year for life on Jiddu, and £300 per year on Jiddu's brother Nitya during the years Nitya was a student at Oxford University..<br>
<br>
Dodge and De La Warr also supported the Suffragette movement and became involved with Francis Meynell. They helped him and George Lansbury purchase the Daily Herald, a bankrupt Labour newspaper. It was re-launched as a socialist daily newspaper and supported the militant suffrage campaign. Later the two ladies helped Meynell create the Pelican Press.</div></blockquote></div>

Warwick House was right next to Carlton House <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_House" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_House</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Carlton House was a mansion in London, best known as the town residence of the King. It faced the south side of Pall Mall, and its gardens abutted St. James's Park[1] in the St James's district of London. The location of the house, now replaced by <span style="color:#FFFF40">Carlton House Terrace</span>, was a main reason for the creation of John Nash's ceremonial route from St James's to Regent's Park via Regent Street, Portland Place and Park Square..</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Carlton House Terrace is a street in the St James's district of the City of Westminster in London. Its principal architectural feature is a pair of terraces of white stucco-faced houses on the south side of the street overlooking St. James's Park. These terraces were built on Crown land between 1827 and 1832 to overall designs by John Nash..This building was once the original location for offices belonging to the <span style="color:#FF0040">Information Research Department (IRD), a secret branch of the UK Foreign Office</span> dedicated to creating pro-colonial and anti-communist propaganda during the Cold War.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Oscar Wilde makes reference to Carlton House in his fictional novel The Portrait of Dorian Gray,</span> published in 1890. In chapter 11, as the protagonist looks over portraits of his ancestors, he writes, "What of the second <span style="color:#FF0040">Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent </span>in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose! What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as infamous. <span style="color:#FF0040">He had led the orgies at Carlton House</span>. The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast."</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The passages below reveal a connection between Oscar Wilde, his wife and Madame Blavatsky during her time in London.<br>
<br>
Constance Wilde and Blavatsky<br>
<br>
The London Express of Friday, June 24, carries a review of Fanny Moyle’s biography, Constance, about Constance Wilde, wife of Oscar Wilde, published in the U.K. by John Murray. The reviewer says:<br>
There is a wonderful episode which brings the whole era alive. She and Oscar are at the opening of Dorothy’s, a restaurant exclusively for women in Oxford Street and <span style="color:#FF0040">they are at Madame Blavatsky’s table talking theosophy. Soon after, Constance joins the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</span>.<br>
<br>
The Dorothy restaurants were the project of a pupil of Mme. Blavatsky’s, Isabel Cooper-Oakley, who operated two Dorothy restaurants in London, one for West End working girls and one for ladies, which opened until 10 PM with good food “in secure surroundings.” HPB had wanted Oscar Wilde to review her Key to Theosophy, but nothing came of this.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Larz Anderson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larz_Anderson" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larz_Anderson</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Larz Anderson (August 15, 1866 – April 13, 1937) was an American diplomat and bon vivant. <span style="color:#FF0040">He served as second secretary at the U.S. Legation to the Court of St. James's, London</span>; as first secretary and later chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Rome; as U.S. Minister to Belgium; and then briefly as the Ambassador to Japan. He also unsuccessfully sought appointment as Ambassador to Italy.<br>
<br>
Anderson was the son of Brevet Major General Nicholas Longworth Anderson and Elizabeth Coles Kilgour Anderson. He was born in Paris on August 15, 1866,[1] while his Cincinnati, Ohio, parents, who had married on March 28, 1865, were on their planned year-long honeymoon, which was extended six months due to the birth of their son.[2] He was the great-grandson of Lieutenant Richard Clough Anderson Sr., who served in the American Revolution. He was also the grandnephew of Brigadier General Robert Anderson, who defended Fort Sumter at the beginning of the American Civil War.<br>
<br>
Anderson attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, before attending Harvard College.[1] At Harvard, he was a member of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Hasty Pudding Club</span>, the A.D. Club, the Institute of 1770, Alpha Delta Phi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon. After graduating in 1888, Anderson set out on a year-and-a-half grand tour that included his first visit to Japan.[1] When he returned to the U.S., Anderson attended Harvard Law School for two semesters during the 1890–91 academic year.<br>
<br>
In June 1891, after Anderson had dropped out of Harvard Law School, his father interceded with his 1858 Harvard classmate Robert Todd Lincoln, <span style="color:#FF0040">son of President Abraham Lincoln, who was then serving as the U.S. minister to the Court of St. James's in London</span>. Lincoln offered Anderson the job of second secretary of the American legation in London.[<br>
<br>
<br>
..Anderson was admitted to the <span style="color:#FF0040">Maryland Society of the Cincinnati in 1894,</span> following the death of his father. He was eligible for membership in the Society of the Cincinnati by virtue of being the great grandson of Lieutenant Colonel Richard Clough Anderson of Virginia, one of the founding members of the organization. Normally, members of the Society join the Society of the state from which their ancestor served...<br>
<br>
Because of his diplomatic service, Anderson was admitted to the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (Italy), the Order of the Crown (Italy), the Order of the Rising Sun (Japan), and the Order of the Crown (Belgium).<br>
<br>
Between 1902 and 1905, the Andersons built a Beaux Arts mansion in the fashionable Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Known as Anderson House, the mansion was the couple's winter residence during the Washington social season, which generally extended from New Year's Day through Easter. After Larz's death, Isabel Anderson donated <span style="color:#FF0040">Anderson House in 1938 to the Society of the Cincinnati, of which Anderson was a member, and it now serves as its national headquarters.</span></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Either way if this is correct then this fits in nicely with my recent research on tunnels which led me naturally to the history of Washington DC and Pierre L'Enfant (personally I believe JA is a direct descendant) and the Society of the Cincinnati...<br>
<br>
I've written up more of an in depth subverse <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1568106" class="postlink">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1568106</a>. There is a little back history to begin with but it certainly joins many dots.<br>
<br>
The Society of the Cincinnati have their HQ next door to 1510/1512 21st St. NW. I have a sneeking suspicion Harrison G. Dyar was a member of Society of the Cincinnati and knew very well there were tunnels under Washington. I feel more research is needed on Harrison G. Dyar.<br>
<br>
They both sit a stones throw from The Pilgrimage <a href="http://www.thepilgrimage.org/" class="postlink">http://www.thepilgrimage.org/</a> (sounds like the're breeding an army of SJWs)<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>By connecting faith formation to social awareness and action, we are creating people who are invested in making immediate change, as well as young people who will carry a life-long commitment to social justice.
</div></blockquote>

and a place called the Cosmos Club <a href="http://cosmosclub.org" class="postlink">http://cosmosclub.org</a>. I think the logo speaks for itself..<br>
<br>
[Comment:] Thanks for the info. I did see your thread and read through it. I don't know about JA and whether he's a descendant, but what I do know is that he's always been close to Chris Lynch. Chris Lynch (along with partner Jim Ball) opened "L'Enfant Cafe". There is a whole story there in regards to them seizing control of another agency giving them problems. It seems to be an MO. As for the Society of Cincinnati residing in the house next door to Dyar, that is super interesting. And I agree. There is no doubt that Dyar had help ... and some of that was information regarding existing tunnels. He may well have dug to connect them into a new pattern. The Rock Creek part again makes my ears perk up and tingle. Definitely think there's a tunnel there. Perhaps Dyar connected everything together. Interesting stuff.</div></blockquote>

I'm quite interested in Cincinnati coz : <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3799165/23649869" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3799165/23649869</a></div>

			<div class="content">Hmm.. interesting story : Robert Todd Lincoln  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Todd_Lincoln" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Todd_Lincoln</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Robert Todd Lincoln (August 1, 1843 – July 26, 1926) was an American lawyer, businessman, and politician. He was the eldest child of President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, and the only one of their four children to live to adulthood. Robert Lincoln became a business lawyer and company president, and served as U.S. Secretary of War and U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom...in the Benjamin Harrison administration...<br>
<br>
...On the night of his father's death, Robert had turned down an invitation to accompany his parents to Ford's Theatre, citing fatigue after spending much of his recent time in a covered wagon at the battlefront..<br>
<br>
In 1871, tragedy beset the family again when Lincoln's only surviving brother, Tad, died at the age of 18, leaving his mother devastated with grief. Lincoln, who was already concerned about what he thought were his mother's "spend-thrift" ways and eccentric behavior, and fearing that she was a danger to herself, arranged to have her committed to a psychiatric hospital in Batavia, Illinois, in 1875. With his mother in the hospital, he was left with control of her finances. On May 20, 1875, she arrived at Bellevue Place, a private, upscale sanitarium in the Fox River Valley.[35]<br>
<br>
Three months after being installed in Bellevue Place, Mary Lincoln engineered her escape. She smuggled letters to her lawyer, James B. Bradwell, and his wife, Myra Bradwell, who was not only her friend but also a feminist lawyer <span style="color:#FFFF40">and fellow spiritualist.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Robert Lincoln was coincidentally either present or nearby when three presidential assassinations occurred</span>.[52]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Lincoln was not present at Ford's Theatre when his father was assassinated[53] but he was at the White House nearby,[54] and rushed to be with his parents.[55] The president was moved to the Petersen House after the shooting, where Robert attended his father's deathbed.[56]<br>
At President James A. Garfield's invitation, Lincoln was at the Sixth Street Train Station in Washington, D.C., when the president was shot by Charles J. Guiteau on July 2, 1881, and was an eyewitness to the event. Lincoln was serving as Garfield's Secretary of War at the time.<br>
At President William McKinley's invitation, Lincoln was at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, where the president was shot by Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901, though he was not an eyewitness to the event; he was just outside the building where the shooting occurred.[57]<br>
Lincoln himself recognized these coincidences. He is said to have refused a later presidential invitation with the comment, "No, I'm not going, and they'd better not ask me, because there is a certain fatality about presidential functions when I am present."</div></blockquote>

..Robert Lincoln was once saved from possible serious injury or death by Edwin Booth, whose brother, John Wilkes Booth, was the assassin of Robert's father. The incident took place on a train platform in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exact date of the incident is uncertain, but it is believed to have taken place in late 1863 or early 1864, before John Wilkes Booth's assassination of President Lincoln (April 14, 1865).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Bethlehem Steel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem_Steel" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem_Steel</a> ..During its early years, the company produced rails for the rapidly expanding railroads and armor plating for the US Navy.<br>
<br>
In 1883, <span style="color:#FFFF00">Secretary of the Navy William E. Chandler and Secretary of the Army Robert Todd Lincoln</span> appointed Lt. William Jaques to the Gun Foundry Board. Jaques was sent on several fact-finding tours of European armament makers and on one of these trips he formed business ties with the firm of Joseph Whitworth of Manchester, England. He returned to America as Whitworth's agent and, in 1885, was granted an extended furlough to pursue this personal interest.<br>
<br>
Jaques was aware that the U.S. Navy would soon solicit bids for the production of heavy guns and other products such as armor that would be needed to further expand the fleet.<br>
<br>
During the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, a structure that was designed to make the world marvel received its giant axle from Bethlehem Iron. The world's first Ferris wheel needed enough steel to assemble a 140-foot tower to support an all-steel wheel, altogether making a 264-foot (80 m) structure. The iron made in Bethlehem Steel's blast furnaces was responsible for the world's largest single piece of cast iron that had ever been made up to that time.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>During Harrison's time in office, the United States was continuing to experience advances in science and technology. Harrison was the earliest president whose voice is known to be preserved. That About this sound thirty-six-second recording (help·info) was originally made on a wax phonograph cylinder in 1889 by Gianni Bettini.[128] Harrison also had electricity installed in the White House for the first time by Edison General Electric Company, but he and his wife would not touch the light switches for fear of electrocution and would often go to sleep with the lights on..<br>
<br>
Over the course of his administration, Harrison marshaled the country's technology to clothe the nation with a credible naval power. When he took office there were only two commissioned warships in the Navy. In his inaugural address he said, "construction of a sufficient number of warships and their necessary armaments should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection."[130] Harrison's Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy spearheaded the rapid construction of vessels, and within a year congressional approval was obtained for building of the warships Indiana, Texas, Oregon, and Columbia. By 1898, with the help of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Carnegie Corporation</span>, no less than ten modern warships, including steel hulls and greater displacements and armaments, had transformed the United States into a legitimate naval power. Seven of these had begun during the Harrison term..</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional joint stock corporations as preparation for this. John Pierpont Morgan was a banker and America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the United States Steel Corporation. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Flexner Report of 1910 – The Rockefeller-Carnegie Big Pharma Scam<br>
<br>
..Abraham Flexner (1866-1959) was not a physician or scientist or medical educator. He was a former school teacher, expert on educational practices, had specialized training in psychology, held a bachelor of arts degree, and was founder and operator of a for-profit college-prep school in Louisville, Kentucky. Flexner published a critical assessment of the state of the American educational system in 1908 titled “The American College: A Criticism.” His work attracted the attention of Henry Pritchett, president of the Carnegie Foundation, and a staunch advocate of medical school reform. Flexner’s book consistently cited Pritchett in discussions of views on educational reform, and soon thereafter, Flexner joined the research staff at the Carnegie Foundation in 1908. ..<br>
<br>
The Flexner Report transformed the nature and process of medical education in America with the resulting elimination of natural medicine schools, and the establishment of the biomedical pharmaceutical drug model as the gold standard of medical training. It is a book-length study of medical education in the U.S. and Canada, written by Abraham Flexner, was published and given to the U.S. Congress in 1910 under the endorsement and financial support of the Carnegie Foundation. Congress acted on the report's conclusions and made them law. At the time, 155 medical schools existed in North America, and Flexner visited and conducted an in-depth evaluation of every school.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Many news channels broadcasted that Abdul Baha was saved by the British army, another media reported that he was saved by British secret service. The unprejudiced and sincere Bahais were shocked to hear from non Bahai News channel and they started questioning what a ‘Faith’ has to do with the secret service of Imperialistic Nation.This was the first time that non Iranian news channel and news broadcaster have thrown light on Bahai-Britain relationships. These Bahais were fearful to put their question to the Bahai Administration as they feared sanction.<br>

On 23 September 1918, in what is believed to be one of the last cavalry charges in modern military history, Indian soldiers carried out an attack that allowed British forces to capture Haifa from the Ottoman Empire.As they did so, they also ensured the safety of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who was the son of Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Baha’i faith. At the ​time, Major Wellesley Tudor Pole, one of the officers serving with General Allenby and an early British Baha’i, feared for the safety of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his family and made a case to General Allenby that they should be protected.”<br>
<br>
On May 14, 1948, the Arab village of al-Nuqayb, where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had owned land and grown grain, was depopulated in the fighting which broke out after the U.N. General Assembly’s adoption on November 29, 1947 of the Partition Plan for Palestine. Al-Nuqayb (transliterated as Nughayb in the Bahá’í orthography) is mentioned in Lady Blomfield’s The Chosen Highway, in the sectioned titled Bahá’í Villages...... In his book All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948, the historian Walid Khalidi details the history of many of these Palestinian villages and how they were depopulated. For example, he notes that in the 1880s most of the village land of al-Nuqayb was purchased by Bahá’u’lláh, with the villagers continuing to farm as tenant farmers. In the 1920s, <span style="color:#FFFF40">this land was sold by Shoghi Effendi to the Jewish National Fund. <br>
</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">On April 27, 1920, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was ceremonially knighted, an event which was prominently reported in the Bahá’í periodical Star of the West.<br>
</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">On February 23, 1914, at the eve of World War I, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had hosted Baron Edmond James de Rothschild, a member of the Rothschild banking family who was a leading advocate and financier of the Zionist movement, during one of his early trips to Palestine.</span><br>

Victor Rothschild, who worked for J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., and was an important part of MI5 (British Intelligence). Victor Rothschild was also a communist and member of the Apostles Club at Cambridge.45 Lord Rothschild was one of the original members of Rhode’s Round Table group which developed into the CFR. It was the Rothschilds who had financed Cecil Rhodes, beginning in Africa. The Rothschilds’ have several agents which their money got started and who still serve them well, the Morgans and the Rockefellers. The Rockefellers were Marrano Jews. The original Rockefeller made his money selling narcotics, (they weren’t illegal then). After acquiring a little capital he branched out in oil. But it was the Rothschild capital that made the Rockefeller’s so powerful. "They also financed the activities of Edward Harriman (railroads) and Andrew Carnegie Steel." <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/victor_rothschild.html" class="postlink">http://www.whale.to/c/victor_rothschild.html</a>

			<div class="content">Why the US Navy once wanted to turn Wisconsin into the world's largest antenna <br>
<br>
<br>
The Navy boasts its own version of Area 51. The Navy’s submarine community is experimenting with <br>
<br>
its own version of futuristic technology to TEST UNDERWATER VEHICLES,weapons,and systems.<br>
<br>
The Navy’s hunt for solutions to technical challenges include everything from video gaming to <br>
<br>
smart phones. (Elon Musk) Wisconsin is known for producing key naval capabilities. The USS Wisconsin<br>
<br>
will be the name of the newest Columbia class submarine. This shipbuilding in Wi is a testament <br>
<br>
to the strong ties between the state and the U.S.Navy. Submarines are used for marine science and <br>
<br>
exploration as well as transportation. Elon Musk has bought the Lotus submarine car prop from a <br>
<br>
James Bond movie and plans to convert it into a real car that transforms into a sub -- <br>
<br>
with the benefit of a Tesla electric power plant.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Great Lakes in Wisconsin connect, including Racine. They flow in to Lake Mi which goes out to <br>
the ocean and north to canada (as the underground railroad did ). The S.S. Badger is the last coal-fired passenger <br>
steamship in operation. It was listed on the Nat’l Register of Historic Places which makes it eligible<br>
for grants and tax credits.<br>
                              ties to the gov. hmm<br>
<br>
The Great Lakes have an Underwater tunnel for subs. So we now we have access to the very <br>
waters that are the hubs for trafficking drugs, money, weapons and people. The elites literally<br>
live in the area that used to be Aztalan. Many elite travel to racine for global events. Their <br>
secret hub is in Racine. Natives believed that the spot where Racine now stands was where souls<br>
ascended to heaven. A reference to this is encoded in the Rotary Club’s logo. It’s also referenced<br>
by the Great Lakes likely giving it a connection to the mound builders. So there’s probably some <br>
important stuff there.</div>
