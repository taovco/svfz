<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic9ES3AxV5E" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic9ES3AxV5E</a> - YouTube link, preferably watch this one.<br>
<br>
This part focuses on D.C. elite socializing, hanging out on same events, often with focus on Cafritz family (connected to NXIVM through Pamela Cafritz), Maccoby and Folger, also Clintons and FAPE associates. People connected to Innocents At Risk. It touches adoption topic. Very often I show it through lens of elite's friends like Kyle Samperton or Tony Powell who are photographing elite events - both friends of James Alefantis.<br>
<br>
0:00 - 11:48 - First I introduce Kyle Samperton and Tony Powell, standing close to each other in picture from article about them - they are often photographing elite events in D.C. so they know a lot of elite people.<br>
<br>
Then I drop article about Pamela Cafritz being daughter of Buffy and William Cafritz and Pamela being complicit in NXVIM dark side, Pamela also lured 12 year old girl for NXIVM leader and pedophile - Keith Raniere.<br>
<br>
I show Hillary Clinton honored at Woodrow Wilson Center. Buffy Cafritz is present.<br>
<br>
Then I show Buffy Cafritz holding hands with Hillary Clinton at Cafritz/Jordan Party in 2009 from Washington Life Magazine.<br>
<br>
FAPE Annual Event Photos - present are David Deckelbaum and FAPE Trustee Emerita Buffy Cafritz. Also Jane Lipton Cafritz and her husband Calvin Cafritz<br>
<br>
FAPE Dinner at The East Wing Art Gallery - photos by Tony Powell - Present are Hillary Clinton, Beth Dozoretz. I show image with connections [outside of that particular event] of Dozoretz to circle of Clintons, Alefantis. Then I come back to that event showing Heather and Tony Podesta being there. Also present are Buffy Cafritz and Robert and Marion Rosenthals - parents of Jane Rosenthal Cafritz - who was discussing invitation to dinner on James Alefantis Instagram profile.<br>
<br>
I show Tony Powell in friends of James on Facebook.<br>
<br>

Then I proceed to Refugees International Gala photographed by Tony Powell - among present is Richard Branson, he welcomed NXIVM sex cult to his island that is 54 km from Epstein Island, he is also in Epstein contacts.<br>
<br>
Then I show Ludmilla Cafritz (wife of Conrad Cafritz, both friends with James Alefantis) and Izette Maccoby Folger on the opening of TheCityCenterDC Botique.<br>
<br>
In friends of James Alefantis there's another photographer of D.C. elite events. It's Kyle Samperton aka midnightcelt on Instagram.

In Facebook friends of Mary Haft there are: James Alefantis, Jan Rothschild (not related to THAT Rothschild family according to my knowledge), Tamera Luzzatto, Joseph Wills (this guy build Comet) and Nora Maccoby Hathaway. Also in friends of Mary Haft there are: Jane Rosenthal Cafritz, Ludmilla Cafritz and Conrad Cafritz. There are also members of Folger family, Kyle Samperton and Barbara Harrison - she is announcing adoptions in D.C. and is on advisory board of Innocents At Risk (combating child trafficking) together with Izette Maccoby Folger. Barbara is called fairy godmother of D.C foster kids in Washington Post. She is announcing adoptions on November 22 2014. ON same day in same courthouse room where adoptions are announced by Barbara Harrison behind the crowd stands Justin Barrows (this guy build Comet too with Joseph Wills, Scott Cummings and James Alefantis) Justin Barrows is very creepy ...

			<div class="content">This part uploaded on YouTube together with other parts for the sake of better resolution. But not part three about potential Dutroux connections because that is already judged as "harassment" during processing of video, interesting isn't it? Other parts are not but that one is judged as "harassment" before it is even uploaded/published fully.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Since 1983, the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has provided medical and nursing care to children at Camp Fantastic. Camp Fantastic is a week-long adventure for children ages 7-17 years, who are undergoing treatment, or are within 3 years of their last cancer treatment, or are within 5 years of their bone marrow transplantation for cancer. The camp is run in cooperation with Special Love, Inc., a non-profit organization providing unique experiences for children with cancer and their families...<br>
<br>
Special Love has a special logo, check it out : <a href="https://specialove.org/specialevents/" class="postlink">https://specialove.org/specialevents/</a><br>
<br>
..<br>
<br>
NIH Director Francis Collins donned a dragon hat recently when he visited Camp Fantastic (Front Royal, Va.) to help campers celebrate the theme Medieval Magic. The weeklong camp lets children in all stages of cancer treatment shed their cancer image and feel like normal kids again. Camp Fantastic, in its 31st year, is the hallmark program of Special Love, a nonprofit organization that provides cancer families a network of support.<br>
<br>
..“We draw doctors and nurses from NCI, NHLBI, and the CC, as well as from regional hospitals that send kids to the camp,” said Chanock. NCI/NICHD nurse Tamara Jenkins and NIH <span style="color:#FFFF40">Children’s Inn director Kathy Russell</span> “oversee, plan, and coordinate the camp.”<br>
<br>
..Comcast is the proud lead sponsor of the free outdoor film festival, benefiting the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Children’s Charities. Comcast’s sponsorship of this popular ten-day event raises needed awareness and funds for the NIH’s Children’s Charities programs. The Children’s Charities programs work to enrich the lives of seriously ill children and their families both financially and emotionally. The three programs that benefit from this worthy event are <span style="color:#FFFF40">Children’s Inn</span>, Camp Fantastic/Special Love, and Friends of the Clinical Center. </div></blockquote></div>
