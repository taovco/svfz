			<div class="content">This is a follow on from the post <em class="text-italics">Theatre of the Absurd</em> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2816&amp;p=10041#p10041" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2816&amp;p=10041#p10041</a> where I touched on the use of the clown / jester archetype in freemasonry and the counterculture movement via such characters as Wavy Gravy, the Merry Pranksters, and the Warlocks who became the Grateful Dead. <br>
<br>
In doing that post I came across this article: <em class="text-italics">Why Do Jesters and Tricksters Appear in the DMT Experience?</em> <a href="https://www.samwoolfe.com/2019/02/jesters-tricksters-dmt-experience.html" class="postlink">https://www.samwoolfe.com/2019/02/jeste ... ience.html</a> and in looking into DMT I came across this video: jaguar tastes the hallucinogenic effects of yage

This is an interesting clip borrowed from the "Peculiar Potions" episode of BBC's series "Weird Nature" - A Jaguar in the Peruvian rain forest eats Yage (banisteriopsis caapi), a vine containing hallucinogenic chemical harmaline and other beta carbolines, used by natives in a ritualistic ceremony involving Ayahuasca. (it's the one of the two ingredients, <span style="color:#FF0040">the other contains usually DMT</span>)</div></blockquote>

<br>
1986-2003 – Ayahuasca Is Patented in the US <a href="https://ayahuasca-timeline.kahpi.net/ayahuasca-us-patent-trademark/" class="postlink">https://ayahuasca-timeline.kahpi.net/ay ... trademark/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Loren Miller, director of California-based International Plant Medicine Corporation, had brought a sample of B. caapi to the US in 1981. In 1986, an ayahuasca US patent was granted to Miller, who received exclusive rights to breed and sell the vine, which he named Da Vine and claimed to be a new species of plant. About a decade later, the indigenous communities caught wind of this action and attempted to get Miller to withdraw his patent. He ignored their repeated requests.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the Coordinating Body for Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA), a group based in Ecuador and representing over 400 indigenous groups from eight countries, stepped in and challenged Miller’s patent arguing that it was improperly issued. Their request was approved by the US Patent and Trademark Office, and the patent was nullified in 1999.<br>
<br>
However, the PTO allowed Miller to submit new evidence, disregarding COICA’s argument that B. caapi’s religious value should exempt it from any patenting attempt. Two years later, Miller’s patent was allowed to stand yet again, until its expiration date, which came on June 17, 2003. The patent cannot be renewed, and, seeing as its original instatement likely originated solely from the lack of awareness of ayahuasca’s existence, it’s not likely to happen again.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 1972, the first major study of urban ayahuasca shamanism, entitled Visionary Vine, was published by Marlene Dobkin de Rios, a medical anthropologist and psychotherapist who studied the use of psychoactive plants by urban Peruvian shamans. She wrote numerous books and articles about ayahuasca, shamanic techniques of healing, and psychotherapy, and later studied the UDV (União do Vegetal) church.</div></blockquote>

MKULTRA a Psyop / Cover Story?<br>
<br>
This is looking increasingly like a cover story believed by many of those who participated in the operation.

<em class="text-italics">Whether you search in Dutch, French, German, English, American, or South-African newspapers of the past 35 years, you will find that there is virtually no information available on a private association naming itself the 1001 Club. Even in the Netherlands, where Prince Bernhard’s involvement with Bilderberg should be widely known by now, absolutely no one has heard of his role in creating “the 1001″. The only official information available about this club – which the average person is very unlikely to stumble upon – is that it was established in the early seventies by individuals as Prince Bernhard, <span style="color:#FF0040">Prince Philip</span>, Charles de Haes, and Anton Rupert, and that every member paid a one time fee of $10,000 to get lifetime membership – that’s about it. This almost total absence of public awareness seems odd, as the men visiting 1001 Club receptions often represent some of the greatest economic interests on the planet.<br>

<br>
Cathedrals are not necessarily Christian, many were constructed by the Templars as mystery schools and were only taken over by the Church after the French aristocracy decided to murder them all rather than pay off their Usury. St Pauls is unusual in that it has a dome. <span style="color:#FF0040">Domes are meant to contain energy</span> whereas steeples direct that prayer energy up into the firmament. My findings are that St Paul’s is built on the site of the main Roman temple to Lucifer, which in turn was built over the site of a Druidic human sacrifice site – thus the requirement to contain the energy. The pentagrams shown in your blog encompass The City of London. The City is an independent, sovereign state and along with Washington DC and Vatican City, they administer the different aspects of Pope Innocenti’s 3 Trusts of the 1400’s, otherwise known as Unum Sanctum.<br>
<br>
Hawksmoor’s 5 churches are in fact temples in my opinion. which guard and mark the boundaries of the City as do the many dragon statues on the roadways into it. The City is indeed the New Jerusalem as celebrated in that favourite hymn of the same name sung by the Establishment at every opportunity. Its called ‘New’ because the treasures of the ‘Old’ were transported here for safe-keeping away from Suleiman’s sons and daughters. These ‘treasures’ have formed the Capital of Stirling ever since and is the reason why Stirling is the only fiat currency to last more than 50 years – it isn’t fiat, its backed by treasure on infinite value and can be hypothecated to infinity as a result. Its no coincidence that The City is called ‘The Jewish Vatican’ because that’s exactly what it is. Its also no coincidence that the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family hold their coronations and marriages there. St Pauls is a Synagogue.<br>
<br>
Meridian Delta Ltd. had been chosen by the government to develop the Dome as a sports and entertainment centre, and to develop housing, shops and offices on 150 acres (0.61 km2) of surrounding land. It also hoped to relocate some of London's tertiary education establishments to the site.[citation needed] Meridian Delta is backed by the American billionaire Philip Anschutz,..<br>

Meridian Delta Limited operates as a subsidiary of Trinity College, University of Cambridge.

Sisters of Nazareth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_Nazareth" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_Nazareth</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0040">The Sisters of Nazareth, until recently known as the Poor Sisters of Nazareth</span>, are a Roman Catholic apostolic congregation of religious sisters of pontifical right, based in London, England. Members live in "Nazareth Houses" in English-speaking countries around the world: the UK, Ireland, United States, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa...<br>
<br>
History<br>
Victoire Larmenier was born on 21 July 1827 at Liffré, near Rennes, France. <span style="color:#FF0040">In 1851 she entered the Paris novitiate of the Little Sisters of the Poor</span>, taking the name Sister Basil Marie. Shortly thereafter, she and four other sisters were sent to make a foundation in London. This was in response to a request from the London branch of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. In keeping with mission of the LSP they directed their service to the care of the elderly poor.[1]<br>
<br>
In October 1857 the Sisters built the first Nazareth House in Hammersmith. By this time, the Sisters were also caring for poor and infirm children.[1] In 1861 Hammersmith community separated from the Little Sisters of the Poor and were recognised as a diocesan religious community under the title Poor Sisters of Nazareth in 1864.<br>
<br>
In 1924, Archbishop John Joseph Cantwell invited the Sisters of Nazareth to California, where they founded the first Nazareth House in the United States, in San Diego. A home for the aging was established in September 1935.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Child abuse</span><br>
Allegations of cruelty and sexual abuse were made in 1998 about Nazareth Houses in Tyne, Sunderland, Plymouth, and Manchester in England, Swansea in Wales, and Aberdeen, Glasgow, Midlothian and Kilmarnock in Scotland. A report was published on allegations of abuse and brutality at one of the order's homes in Queensland, Australia, over a 90-year period ending in 1976, including 48 children who were part of the British government Child Migrant Programme...</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/opgwe8.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>A book on Cornell University and another one called Power Trip.  I think it might be this one: <a href="https://www.amandalittle.com/power-trip" class="postlink">https://www.amandalittle.com/power-trip</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The story of America's love affair with energy.<br>
<br>
After covering the environment and energy beat for more than a decade, journalist Amanda Little decided  the only way to fully understand America’s energy crisis was to travel into the heart of it. So she embarked on a daring, cross-country power trip to the most extreme and exciting frontiers of our energy landscape.<br>
<br>
In Power Trip, we accompany her to a deep-sea oil rig, the cornfields of Kansas, the catacombs of the Pentagon, the Talladega Superspeedway, and inside New York City’s electrical grid. We visit laboratories creating the innovations that will carry us into a clean-energy future. We also travel back through history to investigate how America developed its unrivaled appetite for fossil fuels. In vivid, fast-paced prose, she illustrates how the same American ingenuity that got us into this mess can get us out of it too.<br>
<br>
With next-generation candor and optimism, Little explores the most promising clean-energy solutions on the horizon, arguing that everything we know about our past teaches us that we can solve the problems of our future. Hard-hitting and forward-thinking, Power Trip is a lively and impassioned travel guide for all readers trying to navigate our shifting landscape, and a clear-eyed manifesto for the younger generations inheriting the earth.<br>
<br>
PRAISE FOR POWER TRIP<br>
<br>
“Power Trip offers a panoramic view of our energy crisis, exploring past, present, and future with hope, passion, and humor. Whether you are liberal or conservative, expert or novice, young or old, you’ll find adventure and insight in this book.”<br>
– Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.<br>
<br>
“Energy is the most important story in the world bar none, and no one has ever told it with more verve than Amanda Little. If you want to know how the world works, and why it may not work much longer, this is the book you need.”<br>
– Bill McKibben, author of Deep Economy and The End of Nature<br>
<br>
“Lively, engaging, and most thought-provoking, Power Trip takes us on a journey through the very wide world of energy, from its colorful past to its high-tech future. Little answers the questions that perplex many and, so importantly, identifies the key questions that only the future will answer.”<br>
– Daniel Yergin, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power<br>
<br>
“Power Trip weaves a fast, fun, and gripping story–one that’s both candid and unflinching in its approach. Amanda represents the best of a new, young perspective, a new voice of green.”<br>
– <span style="color:#FF0040">Robert Redford</span></div></blockquote></div>

<br>
Jill Parker was a staunch supporter of the NHS and an admirer of Aneurin Bevan. It was, of course, Jennie Lee, Minister of the Arts and wife of Aneurin Bevin, who negotiated bail for the vile paedophile Colin Peters, caught ferrying scugnizzi from Naples to Ischia..........Together with David Steel, Anthony Steen and Cardinal Hume (who introduced Savile to the Athenaeum), Sir Peter Parker was a sponsor of Youth Call, a movement chaired by Nick Stacey of Kent social services.&nbsp;..

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>PAEDOPHILE Sir Clement Freud was nominated for a knighthood by ex-Lib Dem leader Lord Steel, The Sun on Sunday can reveal. And Freud was the SECOND child sex abuser backed by the peer - who also pressed for fellow Liberal Sir Cyril Smith to get a gong.<br>
<br>
The evil pair, who shared a Commons office, were both awarded knighthoods in the space of 12 months between 1987 and 1988 after Steel proposed them. His support was given even after he was told of allegations that Smith had abused kids. We revealed last month how the Cabinet Office had refused to tell us who had proposed Freud for a knighthood in 1987.<br>
<br>
But after we appealed, Whitehall caved in and last week confirmed the mystery sponsor’s identity as Lord Steel. Dad-of-five Freud, who died aged 84 in 2009, became a Sir in 1987 when he lost his Commons seat. At the time Lord Steel wrote a glowing obituary, calling him “one of those rare characters who managed to excel in several spheres”.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%28Get_Your_Kicks_on%29_Route_66" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(Get_Your ... )_Route_66</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66" is a popular rhythm and blues song, composed in 1946 by American songwriter Bobby Troup. The lyrics follow the path of U.S. Route 66 (US 66), which traversed the western two-thirds of the U.S. from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The song became a standard, with several renditions appearing on the record charts..<br>
<br>
The lyrics read as a mini-travelogue about the major stops along the route, listing several cities and towns through which Route 66 passes: St. Louis; Joplin, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Gallup, New Mexico; Flagstaff, Arizona; Winona, Arizona; Kingman, Arizona; Barstow, California; and San Bernardino, California. Winona is the only town out of sequence: it was a very small settlement east of Flagstaff and might indeed have been forgotten if not for the lyric "Don't forget Winona", written to rhyme with "Flagstaff, Arizona".<br>
<br>
Many artists who have covered the tune over the years have changed the initial lyrics, usually to "It goes to St. Louis, down through Missouri ..." then continuing with Oklahoma City and so on. Of the eight states through which the actual route passes, only Kansas and its cities are not mentioned (US 66 only passes eleven miles (18 km) inside the state's southeast corner).<br>
<br>
..Nat King Cole, with the King Cole Trio, first recorded the song in 1946 at Radio Recorders in Los Angeles. Capitol Records released it as a single, which became a hit, appearing on Billboard magazine's singles charts...<br>
<br>
The song has become a standard and has been recorded by numerous artists:<br>
<br>

<ul><li>Billy Bragg recorded an anglicised version of the song titled "A13 (Trunk Road to the Sea)" for a <span style="color:#FF0040">John Peel session</span> in 1985. It uses the original music, but the landmark cities are replaced with English towns along the route of the A13, with Bragg inviting listeners to "Go motoring, on the A-thirteen". According to Bragg, he wrote the lyrics while playing with his band Riff Raff in 1977: whilst the band played "Route 66" as part of their set, Bragg "objected to singing about these places that (he) didn't know ... <span style="color:#FF0040">there's a tradition of driving down the A13 to the glory of Southend</span>. Growing up in Barking, that was the promised land, in quite a Springsteenish way". The song was originally meant to be released on Bragg's 1983 debut album Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy; however, it was ultimately not included due to problems getting permission to use the music of "Route 66". It was finally released commercially on the bonus disc of the 2003 compilation Must I Paint You a Picture? The Essential Billy Bragg.</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>Michael Martin Murphey recorded the song for his 1989 album Land of Enchantment. Released as a single in 1990, it peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The 2006 Walt Disney and Pixar animated film Cars includes renditions by Chuck Berry and John Mayer.[7] Mayer's version was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.</li></ul></div></blockquote>

<br>
BY HONOURING A SEX PREDATOR LIKE JOHN PEEL THE BBC SHOWS IT’S LEARNT NOTHING FROM JIMMY SAVILE <a href="https://timetostartcaring.com/2014/10/16/by-honouring-a-sex-predator-like-john-peel-the-bbc-shows-its-learnt-nothing-from-jimmy-savile/" class="postlink">https://timetostartcaring.com/2014/10/1 ... my-savile/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..in March 2012, the Corporation decided to rename a wing at Broadcasting House after Peel, who died in 2004. But while they were preparing to nail a blue plaque on the wall, an allegation was made that the DJ had had sex with an underage girl numerous times on BBC premises in 1969.<br>
<br>
Amid a fusillade of similar allegations involving other former BBC DJs and employees, most notably Jimmy Savile, the Beeb hurriedly shoved the plaque into a drawer. It also said it would consider calling the Peel Wing something else, though in the event it did nothing.<br>
<br>
Now, more than two years later, the Mail’s Sebastian Shakespeare Diary has revealed that the Corporation is dusting off its blue plaque in the belief that the furore has died down. This is a decision that speaks volumes about the BBC. It shows it has still not come to terms with the industrial-scale sexual abuse which it tolerated among its ‘stars’.<br>
<br>
I realise, of course, that Peel is still widely admired as a ‘national treasure’. All I can say is this was also true of many of the figures whose reputations lie in ruins: Jimmy Savile, Rolf Harris, Stuart Hall, Dave Lee Travis and so on.<br>
<br>
Even before the allegation against Peel surfaced in October 2012, there were good reasons, which naturally the BBC had entirely ignored, for suspecting that he had unusual sexual tastes — or at any rate sexual tastes that were unusual outside the BBC.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">As a young man he worked as a DJ in Texas in a local radio station</span>. Much later he recalled that girls, some as young as 13, used to queue up outside his radio station.<br>
<br>
‘Well, of course I didn’t ask for ID,’ he said. ‘All they wanted me to do was to abuse them sexually which, of course, I was only too happy to do.’ He complained that American girls had ‘this strange notion of virginity as a tangible thing which you surrendered to your husband on your wedding night. So they would do anything but s*** you’<br>
<br>
Aged 26, in 1965, Peel married a 15-year-old American girl called Shirley Anne Milburn. He later claimed she and her family had lied about her age. They divorced in 1973. Some years later, after returning to the U.S., she committed suicide.<br>
<br>
In the mid-Seventies, Peel wrote a column in Sounds (a rock music weekly) in which he sometimes mentioned that he preferred the company of fans when they were dressed as schoolgirls. He once put on a schoolgirl uniform for a picture, and ran a Schoolgirl of the Year competition on his Radio 1 show...

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Born John Robert Parker Ravenscroft on August 30, 1939 in Cheshire, England, Peel moved to the U.S in 1960 at age 21 to work for a cotton producer, and soon found other jobs that included working as a travelling insurance salesman.<br>
<br>
During that period he lived in Dallas, Texas and even got the opportunity to talk with the, then, presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, and his running mate Lyndon B. Johnson, who were touring the city during the 1960 election campaign, famously taking photographs of them. He started to work professionally as a Radio DJ while in Texas, and as Beatlemania hit the United States, Peel got a job with the Dallas radio station KLIF as the official Beatles correspondent on the strength of his connection to Liverpool.<br>
<br>
In 1967 he returned to England and worked with <span style="color:#FF0040">the famous offshore pirate radio station Radio London</span> where he started to develop his talent as a promoter of new bands and sounds. At the time, he promoted heavily the Psychedelic Rock scene from the U.S as well as the new emerging bands and music styles in the U.K. After Radio London closed, Peel went to work at BBC Radio 1, and broadcast regularly from 1967 until 2004, that earned Peel the title of the longest serving of the original BBC Radio 1 DJ’s .</div></blockquote>

The Undertones – Teenage Kicks <a href="https://powerpop.blog/2020/01/03/the-undertones-teenage-kicks-powerpop-friday/" class="postlink">https://powerpop.blog/2020/01/03/the-un ... op-friday/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Undertones were a Northern Irish punk band led by Feargal Sharkey. This song got them a record deal when British DJ John Peel played it on his show. Peel was a very influential and well-respected DJ, and he raved about this, even playing the song twice in a row, something he never did before. With Peel’s endorsement, it became a punk anthem and got the group signed to Sire Records...<br>
<br>
From Songfacts:<br>
<br>
Sharkey: “Our only hope was John Peel, and we sent him a copy – that was the only copy we sent anyone”<br>
<br>
Peel died October 25, 2004. This was played at his funeral. <br>
<br>
Guitarist John O’Neill (from Q Magazine): “In 1978 we didn’t think ‘Teenage Kicks’ was the best song. True Confessions was the one we thought people would go for and we only named the EP after it because we were teenagers and it seemed appropriate. When John Peel played it twice on his show we were in shock. I came-up with the title. I was an MC5 fan and they had a song called Teenage Lust and we used to cover Route 66, so with the licks in the chorus I just made the connection. I was actually shocked that there wasn’t already a song called Teenage Kicks because it’s an obvious cliché...<br>
<br>
The line, “teenage dreams so hard to beat” from this song was carved on John Peel’s gravestone. His widow, Sheila Ravenscroft said: “We have put the words on the stone that he would have wanted. I wouldn’t dare do anything else.”<br>

Radio London <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderful_Radio_London" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderful_Radio_London</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Radio London, also known as Big L and Wonderful Radio London, was a top 40 (in London's case, the "Fab 40") offshore commercial station that operated from 23 December 1964 to 14 August 1967, from a ship anchored in the North Sea, three and a half miles (5.6 km) off Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, England.<br>
<br>
The station, like other offshore radio operators, was dubbed a pirate radio station. Its offices were in the West End of London at 17 Curzon Street, just off Park Lane.<br>
<br>
Radio London was the brainchild of Don Pierson, who lived in Eastland, Texas, United States. In a 1984 interview, Pierson said he got the idea in 1964, while reading a report in The Dallas Morning News of the start of <span style="color:#FF0040">Radio Caroline</span> and Radio Atlanta from ships at that time anchored off south-east England.</div></blockquote>

In the early 1960s, Teret met Jimmy Savile after winning the Savile-run singing contest at the Palace Theatre in Manchester.[4] The two men later shared a flat on Great Clowes Street in Broughton, Salford,[4] with Teret becoming Savile's support DJ, assistant and chauffeur...<br>

Another former BBC Radio 1 DJ who was friends with Jimmy Savile has been jailed for possessing indecent images of children after police raided his private yacht. As reported by our sister site PlymouthLive, former Parliamentary candidate Michael Willis, 74, was caught with nearly 500 vile pictures on his computer equipment. Willis, who went under the stage name Steve Merike when he was a disc jockey, was a BBC Radio One DJ in the 1970s. He was also a DJ on the famous pirate station Radio Caroline.

John Peel, recorded June 23,1996:<br>
<br>
"I went over there the beginning-to-middle of 1960.  The first radio programs I did were on a station called WRR in Dallas and they had a rhythm &amp; blues program called Kats Karavan, spelled inevitably with two K's.  I'd gotten some British LPs of blues and rhythm &amp; blues stuff that were only available in Britain, or in Europe anyway, so I went along and played them some of those records and they put me on the radio to talk about them.  I thought they'd probably put me on there because of my extraordinary knowledge of the music, but I think in fact they probably put me on there because they found my accent very entertaining because in those days I used to talk a bit like Prince Charles." ...<br>
<br>
"This was not the day that Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby; it was a few days before that.  It was when he was kind-of presented to the press as the man who'd been arrested and charged. And, I mean, it was just one of those things that -- Earlier on when the assassination first happened, and I'd been - I used to work here for an insurance company on Central Expressway, so I was able to get into town pretty quickly.  I was an office boy, so I could come and go as I pleased, and so when I heard about the assassination, it was announced on the P.A. in the office, and I just drove into town and went to the police cordon and told the policeman, I said, "I'm from The Liverpool Echo" and instead of telling me to piss-off, he let me through.  It's one of those things which sounds so bizarre.  And I walked down - I didn't go to the grassy knoll - I just stood on the other side of the road and kind of watched what was going on until frankly it became boring.  It's hard to imagine that it did, but after I stood there about 40 minutes and watching people scurrying about, so I then went and made what I'd said kind-of retrospectively true and phoned The Liverpool Echo, and funnily they weren't terribly interested.  I thought, Cripes, here's my chance because I've always wanted to be in journalism, so I thought, hey, this is my chance to get into journalism.  I could be The Liverpool Echo's "Man in Dallas", but they really didn't care.  So I was a bit wounded by that, but then that night a mate of mine and I had been driving around and were trying to figure out what to do, and at the end of the evening I said, why don't we go down to the police headquarters and see what's going on. And we got down there, and I said to this policeman, I said "what's happening?"  And he said, "Well, actually there's a press conference down here," pointing to a flight of steps into the basement of the building - "there's a press conference in here in a few minutes."  And I said, "Well, actually I'm from The Liverpool Echo and this is my photographer," and we went down there.  I mean, we didn't have a pen or paper or camera between us, but we went in there anyway.  It's a story that I've told so often that you get to the point where you don't really believe it yourself, it just seems so unlikely.  But then in one of the bits of film of that press conference, we were all standing in this room and they had the identification parade in the basement of this building and they said - Henry Wade said - that this is the man that's been charged in the assassination of President Kennedy, and they brought in Lee Harvey Oswald.  And he stood there looking slightly puzzled and alarmed for a while, and then was taken away again.  In one of the films of this, which they showed on British television, they showed that Jack Ruby was in the room as well - which I didn't know he was until I saw this film  they sort-of panned across the room and in the last few frames you can see me and my friend Bob standing there looking like tourists." ...<br>
<br>
"None at all, no.  I wish, I don't know, y'know, I think, I mean, everybody else does, but I think we'll probably never know the truth."</div>
