YouTube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44p0E_IbgwI" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44p0E_IbgwI</a> [Watch this one preferably]<br>
<br>
This compilation presents connections of James Alefantis and his close circle to Cafritz Jewish family who are connected to NXIVM human trafficking cult run by a pedophile. I mention Bronfmans (also connected to NXIVM) and Rothschilds (connected to Bronfmans, James Alefantis, Epstein, Clintons and more). I also decode symbolism and networks that are using it. For the context I'm using some research from older threads.<br>
<br>
0:00 - 5:22 - Bronfmans are connected to Jeffrey Epstein, Lynn Forester de Rothschild who is connected to Epstein/Maxwell is connected to Bronfman business too. Bronfmans are connected to NXIVM human trafficking cult run by a pedophile Keith Raniere. Cafriz who are Jewish family have member (now dead) family Pamela Cafritz who established slavery aspect of NXIVM and lured children for her partner Keith Raniere. James Alefantis, Maccoby family and Transformer DC are very close to Cafritz family. Lynn Forester de Rothschild is friends with David Brock/James Alefantis. Brock was presenting book in her house.<br>
<br>
5:23 - 9:30 - Anthony Cafritz - the only Cafritz that I've found in D.C who is more influential in D.C art circle and on board of Cafritz family foundation is also socializing with Maccoby family members - Izette and Nora. Anthony also follows Pajama Factory that has been linked to suspicious James Alefantis friend Jeff Smith. I show how Jeff Smith is linked to three different suspicious profiles under three different nicknames, I show some of the activities of those profiles and I begin to set narrative towards explaining "pizza" symbolism.<br>
<br>
9:31 - 11:54 - I show how Nora Maccoby follows Henry David Gerson who is friend of James Alefantis and played Levi (anagram for evil?) role in movie Chapel Perilous for which James Alefantis was an associate producer, written and directed by their friend Matthew Lessner. I'm showing occult symbolism in Chapel Perilous movie, there's a lots of snake references, spiritual references, occult references in that movie that indicate it promotes evil on some level. They're also showing in that movie they are Barack Obama fans which could be important in later context. I show David socializing with James Alefantis and Septime Webre in some private house.<br>
<br>
11:55 - 13:30 - I show how under previously mentioned picture (David picture on James Alefantis profile) James says to user jscottdesign2 that he is missed. Same user travels to Turkey with Alefantis where James pings him so he can see suspicious picture of Alefantis showing little girl and woman looking at Alefantis, he also travels to Venice with James Alefantis where James visits Axel Vervoordt's (accused during Dutroux related accusations) exhibitions. Same user is being followed by Michael Giacalone (ex migrations operations officer) and friend of Podesta and Alefantis. That guy was going on social media by nickname celadon61 that is very similar to celadon which is signature under pedophile site about SM pedo homosexual stories. Interestingly that site mentions variation of pizza pedo code use - Pueros and Zelamir Archive = PZA. I show Nora Maccoby being linked to Kate Damon who commented bizarre taped girl picture on Alefantis profile. Kate also socializing with Nora sister, Izette who works on board of Innocents At Risk (combating child trafficking)<br>
<br>
13:31 - 14:17 - I show Nora following Victoria Lynn Reis (co-founder of Transformer DC, also connected to suspicious activities on social media) and Christopher Boutlier who is friend of the crew and also posting suggestive pictures like boy being set on fire. Whole crew (Alefantis, Kate Damon, Septime Webre, Izette Maccoby Folger) socializing on Halloween as pictured by Boutlier. Again - Folger and James socializing together as pictured by Boutlier. Birthday dinner for David Brock as Boutlier pictures him on private event on his profile. Brock with Alefantis are connected to friend of most powerful human/child traffickers - Lynn Forester de Rothschild. In last moments I show Boutlier posting picture of boy being set on fire by old men, Boutlier comments "bad boy". One of the people liking it is Kyle Samperton aka midnightcelt.<br>
<br>
14:18 - 20:58 - I show Nora Maccoby liking midnightcelt posts. James Huckenpahler liking midnightcelt posts. James Huckenpahler is artist and friends with another artist Nilay Lawson (also friend of Alefantis) - who has been linked to same suspicious profiles as Jeff Smith and is friends with that crew. James Huckenpahler posts creepy dark pictures of baby toys in dark place, liked by James Alefantis. Pictures with kids on same profile are being liked by Jeff Smith, Justin Barrows, Amanda Kleinman - from band Heavy Breathing (previously Apes) that has been linked to promotion of pedophilic undertones within their artistic work. Justin Barrows who was linked to James Alefantis, Jeff Smith and Nilay Lawson together with Victoria Reis is big fan of Heavy Breathing band, the only vid he posted on his YT channel is of their concert. Midnightcelt is also friend with James Alefantis and being followed by Conrad Cafritz who is friend with James Alefantis. Conrad Cafritz is cousin of Pamela Cafritz father. Pamela Cafritz established slavery/human trafficking aspect of NXIVM sect of her partner Keith Raniere - she also lured children for him so he could rape them.<br>
<br>
Midnightcelt is being followed by Sarah Nixon who is socializing with Septime Webre, James Alefantis and sister of Nora - Izette Maccoby Folger. According to pictures posted by Ginny Grenham who is also picturing herself with Hillary Clinton. Ginny Grenham also follows midnightcelt. Sarah Nixon posts picture of her daughter Maggie Nixon with Barack Obama and picture of her daughter among many girls for which location shows Martha's Vineyard island. Obama is too pictured with Maggie on Martha's Vineyard. Martha's Vineyard is place where Bill Clinton (connected with Epstein and Maxwell child traffickers) socializes with husband of Lynn Forester de Rothschild (friends - David Brock, James Alefantis, Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell) who is named Evelyn de Rothschild. Prince Andrew is socializing with them during same time on same island, interestingly Lynn Forester de Rothschild was the one who introduced Prince Andrew to Epstein. Also Prince Andrew is accused of child abuse by Virginia Giuffre (Epstein/Maxwell trafficking victim). Lynn Forester and Evelyn de Rothschilds have their mansion on Martha's Vineyard. Interestingly another child abuser who is accused of child abuse by Virginia Giuffre is Alan Dershowitz. Dershowitz claim he was introduced to child trafficker Jeffrey Epstein by Lynn Forester de Rothschild on Martha's Vineyard. Interestingly, James Alefantis, Matthew Lessner and David Hengry Gerson who are known for satanic movie Chapel Perilous have also produced another movie called "Automatic At Sea" with message about "secret pizza". That movie was created on Martha's Vineyard island when Barack Obama was vacationing down the road. I show how it already had that description of "secret pizza" before pizzagate even broke out. This way I set narrative towards proving that they are indeed using "pizza" as a code word for something.<br>
<br>
Midnightcelt is followed by Kate Damon, Izette Maccoby Folger and Christopher Boutlier. All tied, all connected.<br>
<br>
20:59 - 30:34 - I show how man was arrested after "cheese pizza" post and arrest of DrPizza. So basically two men connected to potential use of pizza code. Cheese pizza was code for child pornography at least a decade ago. People connected to James Alefantis social circle are "joking" about child abuse, some even using blatant nicknames like "pizzafuckingparty" and joking about pizza sacrifice. People who were sometimes pictured at Comet are too connected to weird posts with children or profiles using "pizza" code. Comet Ping Pong employee himself often uses that code. Nilay Lawson (friend of Comet owner - James Alefantis) says about pizza and baby picture that it's "new comet ad". Other user under same picture equals pizza with baby by saying he has picture of himself and pizza as a baby. Nilay Lawson is commmenting killroom picture of Alefantis in weird way "just rinse it off when you're done" or saying about little girl that she needs a "crate around her", she is also liking cartoon picture of Mr Burns eating a child in half, posted on Justin Barrows profile (one of the people who build Comet). Nilay also praised art that included pedophilic behavior. Nilay also posts picture of pizza on sculpture/depiction of woman who could be pregnant - which means that Nilay very likely equals babies or unborn babies with "pizza". Nilay is linked with very creepy art, often liked by James Alefantis. Another profile potentially using "pizza" code but unrelated to Comet Ping Pong so far is Jason Kreher connected to movie industry. He also posts about "child abuse", "missing children" or "crying children". He even posted about "child enthusiast" dream.<br>
<br>
30:35 - 39:06 - James Alefantis posts what is most likely Barack Obama picture in 2012 November election time, James sits beside president. One of the people liking the picture is Avi Gupta aka brownisgood on Instagram, he posts a lot of balloon pictures and creepy pictures like lost shoes or shoes hanging from tree, or what looks like school backpack lying on the ground in darkness. He is friend of Nilay Lawson, James Alefantis, Justin Barrows, Amanda Kleinman and few other people of interests. I show how they interact with each other and show the context again for some people. I show Panda Head Morgan - led by Morgan Hungerford West and at some point Nilay Lawson - activities including "pizza" and "666" code aligning, also liking James Alefantis pictures, or liking creepy Avi Gupta pictures like toddler shoes with ping pong ball in one of them. Balloon pictures posted by Avi Gupta could be explained by some sort of connection with "IT" movie and book by Stephen King that obviously has a killer clown walking around with balloons, one theory links balloons to representations of children killed by monstrous being. So I go into that potential connection. Some people liking those baloon pictures like Amanda Kleinman are also linked to Apes band that on its own site wrote about children going missing and being melted into feed for woodland animals. Apes instructed people to ignore these rumors. I also show Justin Barrows presence on adoption day and usual pizzagate crew liking that pic, including father of girl who was pictured taped on James Alefantis profile and James Alefantis.<br>
<br>
39:07 - 43:44 - Remember Biljana Djurdjevic? Serbian artist and friend of Tony Podesta and James Alefantis. The one who is painting child abuse/sadistic themes with children that could indicate that she tries to portray child snuff/child murder ring reality. She is liking on pizza pictures of James Alefantis on Facebook and she is likely doing that before Pizzagate scandal broke out (November 2016), picture comes from June 2016. She is also being followed by James Alefantis on Instagram and she is friend of his on Facebook. As I've presented in previous compilations she is very well connected to Tony Podesta not only through art selling but also real life events/meetings and being friends on social media.<br>
<br>
This is indication that they are likely using it as a code for child abuse in Tony Podesta and James Alefantis circle. Restaurant/business chains are also good way to launder money or hide illegal activities. It was done before with drug trafficking - which is proven by pizza connections trial where independently owned pizza parlors were used as front for heroin drug trafficking which had imported 1.65 US$ billion of heroin.<br>
<br>
Remember Kate Damon? She posted a picture of Tony Podesta and James Alefantis and huge pizza behind them, she also seems to be linked to some of the more suspicious children related activities of James Alefantis and as pointed out before - efforts with Haiti orphans.<br>
<br>
James Alefantis like to hang out at MoMA - Museum of Modern Art. Some of the people from there were linked to Epstein. Remember that if they are indeed criminals with lots of money involved they need to launder that money. Restaurants are one thing. But art galleries/museums and art organizations like MoMA or Transformer DC (where James Alefantis is president) come in handy because of subjective value of art.<br>
<br>
Another person who is connected to MoMA is Marina Abramovic who is cooperating with them for many years, so it's not like she only likes to hang out there, it's more of a business connection. MoMA's new gallery has been named for wealthy trustee couple with links to Epstein - Glenn Dubin and his wife Eva Dubin. Back in 2016, Virginia Giuffre accused Glenn Dubin of being the first in a long list of powerful men that Epstein's companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, had instructed her to have sex with. Thus this associate of MoMA has been linked to child abuse ring. Another one is Leon D. Black, chairman of MoMA who paid 158 million dollars to Epstein who has been instrumental in obtaining state department of taxation and finance opinion regarding a contemplated transaction involving Black's art.<br>
<br>
Interestingly this Marina Abramovic who is friends with Tony Podesta and was promoted by James Alefantis and Victoria Reis in Podesta house has also been linked to Ghislaine Maxwell in social events in Chateau Marmont of Andre Balazs - who is another influential contact of Jeffrey Epstein. Andre Balazs was often seen socializing with Marina Abramovic and Ghislaine Maxwell.</div>
