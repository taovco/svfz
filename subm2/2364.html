			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Here is a <span style="color:#FFBF00">2009 interview with epidemiologist Tom Jefferson which basically foreshadows the situation we're in now. At the time, the WHO had changed its definition of "pandemic" just in time for H1N1 (swine flu).</span><br>
<br>
I have copied the juiciest parts below:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>: Mr. Jefferson, the world is living in fear of swine flu. And some predict that, by next winter, one-third of the world's population might be infected. Are you personally worried? Are you and your family taking any precautions?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tom Jefferson</strong>: I wash my hands very often -- and it's not all because of swine flu. That's probably the most effective precaution there is against all respiratory viruses, and the majority of gastrointestinal viruses and germs as well.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>: Do you consider the swine flu to be particularly worrisome?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jefferson </strong>: It's true that influenza viruses are unpredictable, so it does call for a certain degree of caution. But one of the extraordinary features of this influenza -- and the whole influenza saga -- is that<span style="color:#FFBF00"> there are some people who make predictions year after year, and they get worse and worse. None of them so far have come about, and these people are still there making these predictions. For example, what happened with the bird flu, which was supposed to kill us all? Nothing. But that doesn't stop these people from always making their predictions. Sometimes you get the feeling that there is a whole industry almost waiting for a pandemic to occur.</span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>: Who do you mean? The World Health Organization (WHO)?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jefferson</strong>: <span style="color:#FFBF00">The WHO and public health officials, virologists and the pharmaceutical companies. They've built this machine around the impending pandemic. And there's a lot of money involved, and influence, and careers, and entire institutions! And all it took was one of these influenza viruses to mutate to start the machine grinding.</span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>: On your Italian homepage, there is a "pandemic countdown" that expires on April 1. Don't you think the situation calls for just a bit more seriousness?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jefferson</strong>: I'm just using it ironically to expose the false certainty that we are fed.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>: Do you think the WHO declared a pandemic prematurely?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jefferson</strong>:<span style="color:#FFBF00"> Don't you think there's something noteworthy about the fact that the WHO has changed its definition of pandemic? </span>The old definition was a new virus, which went around quickly, for which you didn't have immunity, and which created a high morbidity and mortality rate. Now the last two have been dropped, and that's how swine flu has been categorized as a pandemic.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>: So why aren't researchers interested in viruses other than influenza?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jefferson</strong>: It's easy<span style="color:#FFBF00">: they can't make money with it. Against influenza, though, there are vaccines, and there are drugs you can sell. And that's where the big money from the pharmaceuticals industry is.</span> It makes sure that research on influenza is published in the good journals. And that's why you have more attention being paid there, and the entire research field becomes interesting for ambitious scientists.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>: But is there any scientific reason to be interested in influenza viruses?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jefferson</strong>: The strict focus on influenza is not only misguided; it's also dangerous. <span style="color:#FFBF00">Do you remember something called SARS? That was a truly dangerous epidemic. It was like a meteor: it came and it went quickly, and it killed a lot of people. SARS took us by surprise because it was caused by a completely unknown coronavirus. Where did it come from? Where did it go? Or is it still here? We still don't know.</span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>:<span style="color:#FFBF00"> You have been systematically evaluating all the studies on immunization against seasonal influenza. How good does it work?</span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jefferson</strong>: <span style="color:#FFBF00">Not particularly good.</span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SPIEGEL</strong>: <span style="color:#FFBF00">So, at the moment is it reasonable to keep vaccinating against seasonal influenza?</span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jefferson</strong>:<span style="color:#FFBF40"> I can't see any reason for it, but I'm not a decision maker.</span></div></blockquote>

That's correct.  Good hygiene is the number one preventative measure against respiratory viruses. <br>

<br>
"Months after the Trump Administration’s chopped the CDC’s immunization fat and excesses, a UK-based non-profit Vaccine Confidence Project produced a report for the European Commission called, “The State of Vaccine Confidence in the EU.”<br>
<br>
In the WHO-CDC’s plan to convince the masses that vaccines are safe and effective, the Vaccine Confidence Project, a partnership between GSK, Brighton Collaboration, UNICEF, the CDC, the WHO, and long list other organizations, formulated a plan to attack “anti-vaxxers” by defining vaccine confidence"</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Are Vaccine Travel Passports Next?<br>
<br>
Called the Roadmap on Vaccination, the European Commission has created and published a timeline of deliverables, including the distribution of a “common vaccine card/passport for EU citizens.” This undoubtedly means that soon, to be able to travel through Europe, people will need to show that they have been injected with a select number of vaccines. I recently spoke with a vaccine expert, who wished to remain anonymous. Their assessment was the EU program will require vaccine records with proof of vaccination against polio, diphtheria pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and the seasonal or universal flu shot...<br>
<br>
Biometric Passport in America<br>
<br>
Last year, DHS announced it will build a Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART) that will work in conjunction with valid government IDs. The massive artificial intelligence database will use a plethora of biometric and relationship data points to positively identify people, including their DNA, palm prints, scars, physical markings and tattoos. It will also track their geolocation and monitor behavior for predictive analytics...<br>
<br>
In the near future, the threat would become evermore worrisome if DHS links individual immunization records through the <span style="color:#FFFF40">CDC’s IIS tracking system to HART and Real-ID 2020.</span> People could be prohibited to travel, to enter government facilities, to secure government-backed student loans and mortgages, to drive motor vehicles and to receive any type of insurance. Either people submit to full compliance or be shutout from this abbreviated list.

<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040"><strong class="text-strong">In 2013, a newly formed IIS Executive Board</strong></span> comprising federal, state, and local government stakeholders, assisted CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) in the development of a strategic plan that analyzed the current state of IIS and provided direction for continued enhancement of the quality, performance, and position of IISs in the health information technology (IT) infrastructure. <span style="color:#FF0040">The Immunization Information Systems Strategic Plan for 2014-2017 was released in November 2013.</span><br>
<br>
The 2018-2020 strategic plan builds on the previous plan and aims to continue the progress attained in IIS performance, standards, sustainability, and strengthening connections to the health IT environment.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>An 11Alive investigative series uncovered claims of wide-spread discrimination at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An unprecedented number of CDC employees come forward with details about their complaints, typically kept secret, because someone at the agency disclosed a list of nearly every employee who filed complaints to 11Alive Investigator Andy Pierrotti over the past decade.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Anjella Johnson-Hooker is one of those employees who filed a complaint.</span><br>
<br>
She was a top management official at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). At the time, Johnson-Hooker was responsible for a $5 billion budget and 1,300 employees.<br>
<br>
Throughout her 17-year career, the agency recognized her with awards and accomplishments. One of those achievements included creating a system to track immunizations and vaccines across the world, a project the CDC struggled to launch for eight years. Johnson-Hooker told 11Alive she got it up and running in a year.<br>
<br>
"I’ll never forget," she said. "Even senior leaders did not think it could be done, because it hadn’t been done."<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Six years later, new CDC management came onboard, and in 2016, Johnson-Hooker was forced to re-apply for her job. </span>Despite a stellar record, management told her they were looking for fresh blood..<br>
<br>
Johnson-Hooker still works at the agency, but she said she’s no longer invited to strategic meetings and has no voice in an agency she used to run.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Biographical Sketch:<br>
Amy Metroka has been the Director of the Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR) of the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) since October 1997. The CIR was established in 1997 when a NYC Health Code Amendment went into effect mandating reporting by health care providers of all immunizations administered to children age seven and younger to DOHMH....<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Before joining the NYC DOHMH, Ms. Metroka served as the Associate Project Director of the All Kids Count (AKC) Project of the Medical and Health Research Association (MHRA) of NYC, Inc. from January 1992 through September 1997.</span> Her role at the AKC/MHRA project, which was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the NYC DOHMH, was to assist the DOHMH in a comprehensive planning process for establishing a childhood immunization registry in NYC. This included conducting outreach to parents, providers and health plans to facilitate their participation in the planning process. She also assisted DOHMH in forming the NYC Coalition for Immunization Initiatives, the advisory council to DOHMH for the CIR and the core program components of the DOHMH Bureau of Immunization. This Coalition, which includes representatives of medical professional associations, public and private providers, health plans, child advocacy organizations, and vaccine manufacturers, has been a key partner in establishing and promoting the CIR. Amy Metroka is a founding member of the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA), and served as AIRA president from 2000 - 2003.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Since 1997, the Council has been a member of the state-level KIDS COUNT network, supported with f<span style="color:#FF0040">unding by the Annie E. Casey Foundation.</span> A primary objective of the New York State KIDS COUNT project is to disseminate county-level data that focuses on child well-being in order to advance the use of children’s health, education and well-being indicators as a tool for policy development, planning and accountability. Utilizing a framework called New York State Touchstones, data from numerous state agencies are organized by six major life areas</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The earliest iteration of immunization registry funding in the<br>
U.S. came in the wake of a health crisis. The nationwide measles<br>
epidemic of 1989-91 shocked the country into the realization<br>
that it could not be complacent about childhood immunization...<br>
<br>
In response, the first Bush administration and Congress quickly<br>
moved to authorize new spending to improve vaccine delivery<br>
and immunization practice <br>
<br>
...Also, during the early 1990s, funding from the private<br>
philanthropic sector became available for early registry<br>
development, serving as a critical stimulus to innovation. The<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)</span>, along with several<br>
other smaller philanthropies, launched the <span style="color:#FFFF40">All Kids Count (AKC)<br>
program in 1991</span>. <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">The other foundations were t<span style="color:#FFFF40">he Annie E. Casey Foundation,<br>
the Skillman Foundation, the Flinn Foundation, the Lucile<br>
and David Packard Foundation, and the California Wellness<br>
Foundation.</span></em><br>
<br>
It began with one-year planning grants of up to<br>
$150,000 issued to 23 state and local health departments, leading<br>
in 1993 to 12 four-year implementation grants of up to $525,000, a<br>
phase that came to be known as AKC I. The purpose of AKC I was<br>
to use philanthropic funding to learn not only if immunization<br>
registries would work, but how they work best and whether they<br>
were promising enough to warrant sustained public funding</div></blockquote></div>
