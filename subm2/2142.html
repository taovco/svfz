			<div class="content">In Jan, I went into a supermarket I have been using for many years. I had been there muzzle-free on many ocassions. This time, a brown woman physically stepped in front of me to stop me entering and told me I needed a mask. This is contrary to what my doctor has advised me. A mask is classified as a medical advice, so this bitch was practising medicine without a licence.<br>
<br>
I am not a large woman and this brown bitch called the male manager and a nigger security guard on me and they all 3 harassed and victimised me in full view of others - to the point where I had to leave. <br>
<br>
Of course I made a formal complaint to the HQ which has gone unanswered, I sent it 3 x including by special delivery to the CEO. To give them extra work I also made a formal request for all CCTV footage and documentation relating to the incident; that dept did respond because they have a statutory obligation to do so - they claimed that part of the store is not covered by CCTV. You know - the area that ALL retailers have covered as standard for obvious reasons. <br>
<br>
Fine. So the manager, a White faggot, refused to give me his name on the day and told his staff not to give me their names. But of course his name is all over the internet as the store manager. Not only that, I used my bogus FB account to find him and he's such a cock that his entire FB profile is OPEN; 80% of his posts are about farting and his "nuisance" neighbours who disturb him by cutting their lawn and having barbecues in their own garden. For a 41 year old, his posts are puerile and vulgar. He also made a post advocating violence against women and one some people could deem racist. Made screenshots of everything. <br>
<br>
Dipshit also has a LinkedIn profile so I have his entire career history, educational background, date of birth, area he lives, etc.<br>
He's looking for a new job asap. <br>
Next step - I searched the employment tribunal transcripts freely available online. He was the HR manager involved in the unfair dismissal of a longstanding minority employee. In short, the judge commented on the record about his unprofessional conduct and lack of integrity. <br>
<br>
Now on to the fun part. I made a twitter profile that looks like an Equal Rights group that advocates for women's rights, nigger rights, disabled people's rights, etc etc. <br>
<br>
Then I started drip feeding screenshots from his FB profile, the employment tribunal etc and "copied" the store. Asked if they tought it was appropriate for their store manager to make public racist posts - especially after what happened in that employment tribunal! Not to mention his public post advocating violence against women! No wonder he harasses female shoppers!<br>
<br>
Ahahah, and I'm only warming up. He thought it was cool to harass an old woman, that was a mistake because I have many decades' experience in how to be a bitch and I don't like being bullied by homosexuals. I'm going to take him on a ride he won't believe. Funnily enough - after 9 weeks' silence in relation to my complaint, a tweet popped up from the store saying "We are looking into this urgently".<br>
<br>
Oh I'll bet - because I also tweeted a black tranny disability group and warned them this store manager is racist and disability-phobic...... and I haven't even started reposting his fart-fetish posts yet.</div>

I just wish it were a better system. i wish it was a better society that didn't require such actions because little old ladies weren't harassed to begin with. But if this the way they want to play it,that's the rules. Keep going.</div>

Teach me, teach me! He knew what he was doing, medical exemptions apply and I have one and I told him. They breached their statutory obligations under the relevant "equality" legislation. And their own fucking CEO is ok with it. AND they are witholding the CCTV by claiming it does'nt exist.</div>

Good on you for using the system against itself. I just wish it were a better system. i wish it was a better society that didn't require such actions because little old ladies weren't harassed to begin with. But if this the way they want to play it,that's the rules. Keep going.

Ok I'm old but not "little old lady" old. Just so you know.</div>
