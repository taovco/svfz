<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hillary, on a somewhat (but not completely) different track from the one that's brought us together of late: [REDACTED]—a dear friend who's been vastly helpful to [REDACTED] in her current "science experiment," and who, as you know, [REDACTED] and whom you've supported via the <span style="color:#FF0040">Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation</span>/mother-to-child int'l work—would be interested, when the time is appropriate, in working for you on issues like PEPFAR (pediatric AIDS in particular), obesity, tobacco, women's reproductive health, pandemics, and global public health in general. These are, as you also know, not subjects on which State has traditionally asserted or distinguished itself. But [REDACTED] gueses—as do I—that that's about to change. If and when you or someone one your behalf wants to reach out to him, best is by e-mail: . Cheers, Strobe</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

Founded in 1988 by Elizabeth Glaser, Susie Zeegen, and Susan DeLaurentis, EGPAF’s mission is to end global pediatric HIV/AIDS through prevention and treatment programs, research, and advocacy.  The organization has had a presence in Kenya since 2000 and has since grown into one of the largest HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs in the country.

We plan to start eating (and drinking) in the early afternoon hours at 3 p.m. Kosher and vegetarian options will be available. We will have a decent selection of white and red wines at hand as well as beer. This is a family friendly event, so you should bring all children that are available.

Posts about Sasha Lord always trigger my memories about the strange visit by Prince Charles to Washington DC to meet Obama and talk about "good food" when he visited that DC farm and met that actress/herbalist/yogi, connected to the Sasha Lord community and who was murdered.. anyhoo...

<br>
In 1979 the film “Caligula,” directed by Tinto Brass and starring Malcolm McDowell, shocked the world with its explicit portrayal of the emperor’s cruel and salacious escapades. It was the first major motion picture that juxtaposed segments featuring respected, mainstream actors with scenes that were essentially pornographic. To this day, the highly controversial movie remains banned in some countries.

What a revelation the The Master Class in Synthetic Genomics was. In addition to being informative on so many literal levels it reinforced the mystery and wonder of the world. George Church and Craig Venter were generous to give us a glimpse of where we are today and fire the imagination of where we are going. It's all science but seems beyond science fiction — living forever, reprogramming genes, resurrecting extinct species. All told at SpaceX — a place where people are reaching for the stars, not just thinking about it but building rockets to take us there. Where Elon Musk contemplates the vastness of space and our tiny place in it, where we gained a perspective on the things that are very small and beyond the vision of our eyes. So small it's a wonder we even know they are there. Thanks for giving us a profound glimpse into the future.</div></blockquote>
