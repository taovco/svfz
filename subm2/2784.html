<br>
That's an idea started by pedophile Nicholas Negroponte at MIT <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child</a><br>

 <blockquote class="uncited"><div>When the program launched, the typical retail price for a laptop was considerably in excess of $1,000 (US), so achieving this objective required bringing a low-cost machine to production. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer designed by <span style="color:#FF0040">Yves Béhar</span>.[3] The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel. Chi Mei Corporation, Red Hat, and Quanta provided in-kind support...<br>
<br>
The OLPC program has its roots in the pedagogy of Seymour Papert, an approach known as constructionism, which espoused providing computers for children at early ages to enable full digital literacy. Papert, along with Nicholas Negroponte, were at the MIT Media Lab from its inception...Negroponte led the creation of the first corporation for this: the Hundred Dollar Laptop Corp...<br>
<br>
At the 2006 Wikimania, Jimmy Wales announced that the One Laptop Per Child Project would be including <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wikipedia</span> as the first element in their content repository...At the 2006 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) announced it would back the laptop....In 2008, OLPC lost significant funding. Their annual budget was slashed from $12 million to $5 million which resulted in a restructuring on January 7, 2009. Development of <span style="text-decoration:underline">the Sugar operating environment</span> was moved entirely into the community...

Sugar operating system?  Hmm.. there's a theme emerging here..  now who bought themselves a St Kitts and Nevis citizenship via the SIDF?  Answer: Telegram boss Pavel Durov  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Alma mater : Saint Petersburg State University<br>
<br>
Pavel Valerievich Durov (Russian: Па́вел Вале́рьевич Ду́ров; born 10 October 1984) is a Russian-born entrepreneur who is best known for being the founder of the social networking site VK, and later the Telegram Messenger.[3] He is the younger brother of Nikolai Durov. Since being dismissed as CEO of VK in 2014,[4] the Durov brothers have traveled the world in self-imposed exile[5] as citizens of Saint Kitts and Nevis.[6] In 2017 Pavel joined the World Economic Forum (WEF) Young Global Leaders as a representative of Finland.<br>
<br>
Upon leaving Russia, <span style="text-decoration:underline">he obtained Saint Kitts and Nevis citizenship through donating $250,000 to the country's Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation</span>, and secured $300 million in cash within Swiss banks. This allowed him to focus on creating his next company, Telegram....Later he tried to launch the "Gram" cryptocurrency and the TON platform, raising a $1.7 billion startup with <span style="text-decoration:underline">investors including the widow of Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs</span>. ..

When I was on the David Icke forum (the old one which had a minefield of elite pedophile criminals information, then all completely lost when they redesigned the website and produced a new forum..*cough*) researching the Hampstead case, some of us were encouraged to use the Russian search engine Yandex instead of Google.. you know.. as an alternative..*<em class="text-italics">cough</em>*  Oh look, Telegram uses the Yandex cloud.. <a href="https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/tracker/telegram" class="postlink">https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/tracker/telegram</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Negroponte occasionally came up with bold plans, including one in 2011 where he declared he would drop tablets out of helicopters loaded with 100 books as a way to encourage children to read. These tablets were never created, and by 2014 the OLPC Foundation was defunct. The OLPC Association continued to distribute laptops in Latin America; in 2015 the association was acquired by the Fundación Zamora Terán, a Nicaraguan nonprofit whose wealth comes from banker Roberto Zamora. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sugar Labs</span> continues as a nonprofit and continues to develop inexpensive software that can be bundled into computers.

From 1982 to 1984 Karp practiced pediatrics with <span style="color:#FF0040">pediatrician Paul Fleiss</span> in Los Angeles, California.[3] He then opened his own practice in Santa Monica, where he continued to see patients until 2005.

<br>
In the description box of the YT video:<br>
<br>
I managed to deflect Alves' sexual advance, is everyone else as lucky? Assailant Anthony Alves, now age 63, is confronted in this video to confirm he did intentionally overdose me with USC LSD shortly after I had turned 16. It was 1980 when Alves was at USC grad school with access to the vault with LSD in it somehow. That vault was at the USC Keck School of Medicine, Physiology Department. There must be some conspiracy for this to have happened. The federal criminal statute of limitations never ends. <br>
<br>
Did he/they ever stop? Who in assailant Alves' new residence address neighborhood has also been abused? What about the week long multi-family trip to Doheny Beach with children every year? <br>
<br>
Assailant Alves is the March AFB Architect. Alves' home address at 20 Galeana, Foothill Ranch, CA 92610-1828 is in the Saddleback Valley Unified School District where more children are at risk to assailant Alves. <br>
<br>
Assailant Alves' sister Teresa Simmons appears in the video. The location of the video is 3801 E. Larkstone Dr., Orange, CA 92869 where Simmons and her children live with Mrs. Martha Alves, A retired Professor of Music at USC.<br>
<br>
The homes of Alves, Simmons and other conspirators need to be included in the damages we need to seek for a class of victims that should include myself but cannot because technically too much time has passed. There might be many others for whom we can still get a court to provide money damages to. No attorneys will be interested until more victims come forward.</div></blockquote></div>

Mr. Alves grew up in Hayward, CA before serving in the United States Air Force from February 1943 to October 1945 in World War II. He was stationed in Hardwick, England and was a radio operator on a B-24H Liberator plane named "Bonnie Lee" as part of the 8th Air Force. He flew on 33 missions during the war.

An Orchestra’s Near-Death and Transfiguration  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-aug-31-mn-27677-story.html" class="postlink">https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm ... story.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1997, GARDEN GROVE —<br>
<br>
It was a symphony orchestra that had no musicians, no concert hall and no conductor, and was missing almost everything that makes an orchestra an orchestra.<br>
<br>
Overwhelmed by debt and unpaid taxes, the Orange County Symphony had fallen so low that rumors of its death had been constant for three years. But the symphony lives.<br>
<br>
It is operating in the black and this summer had a series of three concerts in Coto de Caza. In November, the symphony will give its regular Children’s Concert in Garden Grove. To put the Orange County Symphony back on track, a cadre of music lovers dealt with a budget nightmare, an angry Internal Revenue Service, a fed-up musicians union, personality conflicts on the symphony board and a romantic tangle that a board member compared to “Peyton Place Revisited.”<br>
<br>
“What’s amazing about what’s going on now is how far they had fallen and how far they’ve come back,” said conductor David Warble. <span style="color:#FF0040">Warble, a former conductor of the Disneyland orchestra</span> who is now touring with Broadway performer Betty Buckley of “Cats” fame, has often volunteered his services to the orchestra and will lead its November concert.<br>
<br>
When it was founded in 1984 as the Garden Grove Symphony, it was greeted by enthusiastic crowds at concerts, most of them held at Garden Grove High School. Then the name was changed to give the symphony broader appeal, the orchestra grew and so did the audiences. The symphony hired well-known soloists and celebrities, such as Patrick Stewart of “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” to work with its mix of professional and community musicians--and the board went deeper and deeper into debt.<br>
<br>
“It got worse and worse and worse,” said <span style="color:#FF0040">Martha Alves, president of the symphony board.</span> “I think there was this pie-in-the-sky attitude about making beautiful music, but in the meantime the ship was sinking.” ...<br>
<br>
Besides Target, Time Warner Inc. and a host of other businesses, large and small, made donations or advertised in symphony brochures. Some forgave the symphony’s debts, including the supporters who were owed the $50,000. The Garden Grove City Council gave the group free office space.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Micheal Maccoby has been on the board of Our Little Brothers and Sisters since 1977. He even did a study on the orphanage with Erich Fromm who was associated with the Frankfurt School..Max Maccoby (SON) is on the board of directors for Friends of the Orphans<br>
<br>
Our Little Brothers and Sisters/Friends of the Orphans/Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs (NPFS)/Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH)is the place where Laura Silsby got her kids from. The different names are explained..<br>
<br>
Micheal Maccoby ran a private practice of Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis from 1962-1988. He would have been a good candidate to carry out MKUltra experiments. He now teaches people how to become leaders ....Reading his academic achievements it would be safe to say he would be very familiar with the works of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Carl Jung wrote books on psychiatry and psychoanalising and analytical psychology. He also wrote a book called Symbols of Transformation that included plenty of esoteric symbology</div></blockquote>

Lots more at both posts.. connections to Scientology..just saying coz Robert David Steele is a friend of Maccoby and once said that us pizzagate researchers didn't know what we were doing.  Now he's selling his own book on pedophilia.  Really looking forward to his Arise Tour around America with all his New Age comrades.</div>
