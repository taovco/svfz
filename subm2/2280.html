<span style="color:#FFFF40"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">In the last few days I've been wondering about the role of the University of Oxford in all of this specifically to do with the current crop of buffoons, I mean politicians, who have emerged from that place.<br>
</span></span><br>
<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Let's take Matt Hancock as an example.</span></span> Dyslexic and clearly on the 'spectrum', he emerged with a First Class Degree in PPE from Exeter College, University of Oxford.  Taking a closer look.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Hancock" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Hancock</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Matthew John David Hancock was born on <span style="color:#FFFF40">2 October 1978</span> in Chester, Cheshire..Hancock attended Farndon County Primary School, in Farndon, Cheshire, and the independent King's School, Chester. He took A-levels in maths, physics, computing and economics.[5] <span style="color:#FFFF40">He later studied computing at the further education college, West Cheshire College.</span>[6][7] He studied at Exeter College, Oxford, and graduated with a first in philosophy, politics and economics, and earned a MPhil degree in Economics at Christ's College, Cambridge a few years later.</div></blockquote>

So after his A Levels he went on to study computing at a further education college.. and then OXFORD, leaving with a First?  Anyone who knows the English education system knows how difficult, even unlikely, that would be.. maybe Daddy and Mummy were well connected?  Or maybe the college has excellent programs? <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sara Mogel, Principal of West Cheshire College said: “It was an evening that our guests and the College will remember for a long time.”</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Former West Cheshire College principal Sara Mogel has been made an OBE for services to vocational education in the New Year’s Honours list. She retired from her post as principal of West Cheshire College in the spring of 2013 having worked in education for all of her career.<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">When she took over at West Cheshire College at the end of 2000 the college had property, financial and quality issues..</span></div></blockquote>

Wait.. If Matt Hancock was born in 1978 and attended the college after A levels (at around 18 years old) for 1 or 2 years he would have been leaving just as she was arriving at the college that had <em class="text-italics">property, financial and quality issues</em>.. then he went to Oxford?<br>

Dee Associates Visit to University of Cape Town - Dee Associates visited the University of Cape Town in January 2018 to meet members of staff from the Department of Chemical Engineering and the local Branch of the IChemE. Dr Mike Hancock (centre right) gave a presentation on behalf of the University of Chester and explored opportunities for student exchange.  Mike also delivered a paper reviewing the latest innovations in Energy Efficiency including the patented OxyGen energy from waste process. The background to the UK’s notable 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was also discussed.

According to Mike Hancock's bio at Western Cape University:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dr Hancock’s has a wealth of industrial experience, and also is a Visiting Lecturer in the department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Chester. His Ph.D. was from<span style="color:#FFFF40"> Cambridge under Nigel Kenney who specialised in reaction kinetics.</span> He joined Shell to see the world --- and was sent to Manchester to train on the petrochemicals site at Carrington. He then moved to a new fertiliser production site next to nearby Stanlow refinery. After many years he joined ICI in a corporate planning role before embarking on consultancy. More recently he has focussed on industrial energy efficiency and has had the opportunity to visit a great many facilities large and small in different sectors. He is a Fellow of IChemE, Fellow of the Energy Institute, Chartered Engineer, member of the Register of Professional Energy Consultants and IRCA registered Auditor for the ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard.</div></blockquote>

CMAC was established in 2011 with support from founding members, such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),<br>
Novartis, and AstraZeneca. Equipment is also provided by various engineering and instrumentation firms,<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">including Cambridge Reactor Design</span>, NiTech Solutions, Amtech, Avantium Crystallization Systems, PSE, Perceptive Engineering, Clairet AWL, Mettler Toledo, and Bruker. There is broad engagement with other<br>
pharmaceutical and fine-chemical companies, such as Pfizer, Sanofi (Genzyme), Fujifilm, Syngenta, and<br>
Johnson Matthey, to name a few. The physical hub is at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow), with<br>
Glasgow, Heriot-Watt, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Loughborough, and Bath Universities rounding out the<br>
multidisciplinary academic team. The center has raised nearly $100 million in two years, initiated several<br>
