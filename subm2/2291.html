<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Giudecca Island, a ten minute ride across the grand canal by public vaporetto, has had a strong association with contemporary art for a while so it's no surprise that it has just officially launched itself as Venice's newest art district. The Venice Biennale Arte has used spaces on the island since the 1980s. <span style="color:#FF0040">And before that, in 1976, Giudecca was the site of various performances by Marina Abramović.</span><br>
<br>
In 2012, a former artist's house, Tre Oci, became a public exhibition space. A photography exhibition by Palermo based artist Letizia Battaglia is currently on show until 18 August. In 2013, Zuecca Project Space, a not-for-profit arts space on Giudecca, founded by innovative young curator Alessandro Possati, hosted Ai Weiwei’s exhibition Disposition. This year, coinciding with the art biennale, <span style="color:#FFFF40">Zuecca Project Space is hosting American artist Warren Neidich's solo exhibition Rumor to Delusion. The centerpiece of the show is an impressive neon display of words referencing the crazy "Pizzagate" fake news story of the 2016 Presidential campaign that accused Hillary Clinton and her staff of running a child sex slave ring out of the basement of the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor in Washington D.C.</span>.....

Leon co-founder and CEO, John Vincent, has co-authored a book, Winning Not Fighting with Sifu Julian Hitch, published in November 2019. The book takes the principles of the ancient martial art of Wing Tsun and applies them to work, life and business.[28] According to Vincent, Wing Tsun shapes the way that Leon operates, and all new employees at Leon are put through Wing Tsun training..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A collective of female artists is inaugurating a new art quarter in Venice to coincide with the opening of the 58th Venice Biennale. Founded by Venetian art directors Pier Paolo Scelsi and Valentina Gioia Levy, the Guidecca Art District will be the city’s first permanent art quarter, and will comprise 11 new art galleries and exhibition spaces, including three national pavilions and a new contemporary art space called the Giudecca Art District Gallery and Garden.<br>
<br>
As implied in the name, the district is being built on the former industrial island of <span style="color:#FFFF40">Giudecca, a historic site that played host to Marina Abramović’s first performance in 1976, Ai Weiwei’s 2013 biennale exhibition, “Disposition,” and Damien Hirst’s 2017 Giudecca Canal exhibition.</span><br>
<br>
..Giudecca island has transformed in recent years from a former industrial area, home to the Dreher brewery, to a buzzing arts district, complete with artist studios, edgy hotels, art-inspired restaurants, and is even home to a few celebrities, including <span style="color:#FFFF40">Elton John and Miuccia Prada</span>.<br>
<br>
..The new spaces will add to the existing art scene on the island, alongside the existing Galleria Michela Rizzo, which was the first gallery to open on the island in 2004. Elsewhere, <span style="color:#FFFF40">the Zuecca Project Space in a former convent of the Le Zitelle church, now linked to the Bauer Palladio Hotel</span>, hosts exhibitions that center around the idea of displacement, a major part of the Venetian identity. The venue collaborated with London’s Lisson Gallery in 2013 to host Ai Weiwei’s show “Disposition.” The cloister of another former convent of Cosma and Damiano has studio spaces reserved for young artists as part of the Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa’s Atelier program.</div></blockquote>

It originally opened in 1880 as the Grand Hotel d'Italie Bauer-Grünwald and moved to its current location in 1902...The Bauer group also owns several other hotels in Venice: the Bauer Casa Nova, adjacent to the hotel on the Campo San Moisè;[2] and the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Bauer Palladio</span> and Villa F, on the Giudecca facing San Marco across the Giudecca Canal... In 1999, <span style="color:#FFFF40">Francesca Bortolotto Possati, granddaughter of Arnaldo Bennati, became the Chairwoman and CEO of the hotel.</span>..<br>
<br>
Elliott Management and Blue Skye investments acquired the hotel through a series of debt restructuring deals between 2017 and 2019. In 2020, the Austrian real estate investment group SIGNA group bought the hotel, adding it to its portfolio which includes the Park Hyatt Vienna, The Chalet N in Lech am Arlberg, and the Villa Eden resort at Lake Garda in Italy.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Belmond Hotel Cipriani is a deluxe hotel on the island of Giudecca in Venice, northern Italy. It is reached by hotel launch from St Mark's Square, a five-minute journey across the lagoon.. The hotel was opened in 1958 by <span style="color:#FFFF40">Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of Harry’s Bar in Venice</span> and inventor of the Bellini cocktail. As well as Giuseppe Cipriani, the partners in the joint company were the three daughters of the 2nd Earl of Iveagh, who provided the financing. The three sisters—Viscountess Boyd of Merton, Lady Honor Svedar and Lady Brigid Guinness—each had a suite designed for themselves and their families. <br>
<br>
The hotel achieved instant acclaim. In 1962, the Earl asked Giuseppe Cipriani to rebuild and manage the Hotel Belvedere on his property in <span style="color:#FFFF40">Asolo</span>; this was reopened as the Hotel Villa Cipriani..<br>
<br>
In 1976, the Hotel Cipriani was purchased for £900,000[4] by <span style="color:#FF0040">Sea Containers</span>, which established a leisure division named Orient-Express Hotels Ltd.[5] The hotel subsequently expanded into the adjacent Palazzo Vendramin, a 15th-century palace facing the lagoon[6] and St Mark's Square. A restaurant, Cip's Club,[7] was built on a floating pontoon in the lagoon. In 1990, the adjacent Granaries of the Republic were opened as an event space...<br>
<br>
In 2014, the Hotel Cipriani was renamed the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Belmond </span>Hotel Cipriani as part of the rebranding of Orient-Express Hotels as <span style="color:#FFFF40">Belmond</span>.[9][10] In April 2014, the hotel opened Oro restaurant, designed by Adam Tihany, which in December 2015 was awarded a Michelin star.[11] <span style="color:#FFFF40">George Clooney got married at the hotel.</span></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sea Containers was a Bermudan registered company which operated two main business areas: transport and container leasing. It filed for bankruptcy on 16 October 2006. In 2009 its maritime container interests were transferred to a new company SeaCo Ltd...<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Yale University graduate and retired United States Navy officer <span style="color:#FF0040">James Sherwood</span> founded Sea Containers in 1965,</span> with initial capital of $100,000...

<br>
In March 2006, Sherwood resigned from all positions in the various Sea Containers Companies. Sherwood was replaced by turnaround specialist Bob Mackenzie, while Ian Durant became senior vice-president of finance.<br>

One of Pordu's relatives worked at Scott's Restaurant in Mayfair and then at Sloane Square Hotel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Square_Hotel" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Square_Hotel</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 2005 the hotel was bought by the hotelier John Tham, former managing director of the Cliveden hotel, and renamed the Sloane Square hotel. It was completely renovated in 2006..<br>
<br>
In early 1960, the hotel was temporary home to Peter Llewelyn Davies, a leading figure in London's publishing industry and the inspiration for J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, while en route to Gibraltar.[5] On 5 April 1960, Davies left the bar of the hotel and threw himself under a train at the nearby underground station, making "front-page news around the world"..<br>
<br>
During the 1960s, the hotel was part of the Swinging London phenomenon, which encompassed fashion, music, art and other forms of popular culture. Early in February 1962, The Beatles stayed in the hotel for several weeks, and in the following year they used the building as a venue for a photographic session on 10 February 1963. The hotel also played host to the first meeting between Paul McCartney and his future girlfriend Jane Asher, when McCartney was interviewed by the Radio Times on 18 April 1963</div></blockquote>

<br>
James Sherwood obituary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/james-sherwood-obituary" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/business/20 ... d-obituary</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>James Sherwood, who has died aged 86, was a rambunctious business opportunist who parlayed a fortune made in the unglamorous world of shipping containers into life with the rich and famous by reviving the Orient Express and building up a chain of exclusive hotels. An American, he chose to run his business empire from London, where he constructed a headquarters building overlooking the Thames and mixed in Mayfair society.<br>
<br>
Although he was reckoned personally to be worth £60m by 2004, his eclectic Sea Containers business empire, shaped by whim as much as by strategy, was collapsing under its debts when he was forced to step down in 2006. But his hotel interests blossomed and amounted to over 40 high-class establishments all over the world by the time he died.<br>
<br>
He was an early beneficiary of the privatisation of British Rail, acquiring Sealink ferries and the prime East Coast mainline franchise. He showed his political colours by having the assets of the National Union of Seamen sequestered in a 1988 ferry dispute, though he protested that he did not want to destroy the union. At the handover to his company GNER, he insisted: “We have to break the communist approach to running a railway.” Said one commentator: “He has the habit of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.”<br>
<br>
..After studying economics at Yale, he spent four years in the US Navy Reserve as a cargo specialist. This led to a job with the United States Lines’ luxury transatlantic liners. Posted to Europe, Sherwood devised a plan to capitalise on unused cargo space. He shipped luxury goods, normally expensively airfreighted, in containers, at high rates, and soon found himself regarded as a container expert. He recalled: “It was all entirely bogus but that is how it began.”<br>
<br>
..His British aspirations were advanced with the launch of Harry’s Bar in Mayfair, <span style="color:#FFFF40">which was jointly owned with the impeccably establishment figure of Mark Birley</span> [owner of Annabel's Nightclub]....<br>
<br>
His assorted properties included the 80-acre Hinton Manor in Oxfordshire and an Italian vineyard. His interest in modern art was exercised as a trustee of the Guggenheim Foundation and his support for the arts in Venice included a plan for a glass bridge over the Arsenale canal. He was made an honorary citizen of Venice in 1995.</div></blockquote>

5 hertford Street Mayfair - Who will be crowned King of Clubs in the battles for Mayfair? How a tiger-mauled aristocrat is taking on the perma-tanned maestro of London society <a href="http://5hertfordstreet.blogspot.com/2014/07/who-will-be-crowned-king-of-clubs-in.html" class="postlink">http://5hertfordstreet.blogspot.com/201 ... bs-in.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Richard Caring and Robin Birley are not friends.<br>
Perma-tanned Caring – the rag trade tycoon turned restaurateur – is nicknamed ‘the coat hanger king’ and lives in a vast Hampstead house dubbed ‘the Versailles of London’.<br>
Birley, by contrast, is the languid, aristocratic son of glamorous socialite Lady Annabel Goldsmith and Mark Birley, the club owner and founder of Annabel’s. He is never seen without his whippets...<br>
<br>
Their spat has been caused by Robin Birley’s triumphal return to his old turf with a new club, 5 Hertford Street – on which he has lavished £30 million. As his sister, Jemima Khan, tweeted: ‘After bankruptcy, litigation, bullying &amp; 5yrs of hard slog, it’s a real lesson in tenacity and perseverance.’..<br>
<br>
At the age of 12 Birley was mauled by a tiger at Howletts zoo in Kent, leaving him horribly disfigured. In 1986 his brother Rupert, 30, disappeared while swimming off a beach in Togo, West Africa.<br>
He was disowned by his father and fell out with his sister, India-Jane, when in 2006 he was caught using £200,000 of money from Annabel’s to pay a former policeman for information (which turned out to be false) about a man with whom his married sister had an affair and child.<br>
The following year he suffered the ignominy of his father, just before he died, selling the clubs empire  to which Robin was heir – as  well as Annabel’s it included <span style="color:#FFFF40">Mark’s Club, Harry’s Bar and George</span>, the smartest venues in town – to Caring for about £100 million.<br>
Caring, 60, seemed to have developed an insatiable appetite for buying up social London with a swoop that included Le Caprice, The Ivy, J Sheekey, Scott’s and Daphne’s.<br>
<br>
...But it is in the beautiful courtyard for the smokers, all candlelit and filled with peonies, where the social melting pot of the absolute elite itself converges. Here, we are in a pre-Austerity England time warp. It is glamorous and grotesque.<br>
A billionairess leans over in barely-there lace Stella McCartney and asks Taki Theodoracopulos, the playboy Greek shipping heir, for a light. ‘You can have whatever you like,’ he leers before rising to greet fashionista Debbie von Bismarck, wife of a German count. Does she know that Beatrice and Eugenie York, whom she so disastrously styled for the Royal Wedding, are already downstairs at the bar of the nightclub? Awkward.</div></blockquote></div>

<br>
Blue Skye was founded by Salvatore Cerchione and Gianluca D'Avanzo in 2004  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arena-investors-and-blue-skye-form-italy-focused-joint-venture-301161074.html" class="postlink">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-release ... 61074.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The transmission Report on Rai 3 (Italy), has investigated Yonghong Li and the origin of the Chinese money [Source]and has raised suspicions of money laundering, all linked to the figure of Silvio Berlusconi. The service opens with the reconstruction of the pre-closing events and continues with the images of the journalists in the Chinese office of Li, which deals with phosphorus mines: “we note an abandoned room with garbage bags full of worms.” Later Report shows a scheme of the money with which Milan was taken and explains that most of them derive from tax havens.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">At the top of the list also two Neapolitan financiers who took care of the relationship with Elliott. Gianluca D’Avanzo and Salvatore Cerchione</span>, a manager based in London and whose names were made for the possible CDA of AC Milan. <span style="color:#FF0040">Their partner is Giuseppe Cipriani, a friend of Nicole Minetti, in politics with Berlusconi</span>...<br>
<br>
But what are the anomalies of this affair? Mr. Li chooses as advisor<br>
Rothschild Bank, vice president in London, former Eni, Paolo Scaroni, who is loyal to Berlusconi.<br>
The Neapolitan financiers who put up the financial vehicle for the bridge loan with the Elliott fund € 303 million. They are old acquaintances of Galliani. Galliani yet, with us he did not speak, you heard him...<br>
<br>
The transmission of Rai Tre then underlines how all the people in the business are tied to Berlusconi. “The only one who can tell us who is really Mr. Li, where the money comes from, is you, president Berlusconi. Who is more worthy to tell us who you entrusted AC Milan? Is the sarcastic question with which the service ended.

Curled up barefoot on the 1960s Brazilian sofa in the leather-swathed library, Clarissa has a laid-back demeanor that belies her formidable role in New York cultural life as a vice-chairman of Carnegie Hall, a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, and cochairman of the Guggenheim Museum’s Latin American Committee. (She also practices photography and creates a sought-after line of jewelry.) The six-bedroom apartment, she explains, was conceived as an easygoing environment for raising four children (now ages 15 to 20) and as a flexible backdrop for the global art collection she’s assembled with her husband, a scion of the family behind Seagram distillers and the former CEO and chairman of the Warner Music Group, who is now a venture capitalist with a special interest in profitably reducing carbon emissions.
