			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (KY3) - The Missouri Attorney General’s Office filed numerous charges of abuse against the operators of the Circle of Hope Girls Ranch in Cedar County.<br>
<br>
Authorities arrested Boyd and Stephanie Householder. They remain jailed in the Vernon County Jail in Nevada, Mo. Boyd Householder faces 80 charges. Stephanie Householder faces 22 charges.<br>
<br>
Boyd Householder faces 79 felony charges and one misdemeanor, including six counts of second-degree statutory rape, seven counts of second-degree statutory sodomy, six counts of sexual contact with a student, one count of second-degree child molestation, 56 counts of abuse or neglect of a child, and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Stephanie Householder faces 22 felony charges, including 12 counts of abuse or neglect of a child, and 10 counts of endangering the welfare of a child.<br>
<br>
“My Office has filed a total of 102 criminal charges against Boyd and Stephanie Householder, proprietors of the now-defunct Circle of Hope Girls Ranch and Boarding School,” said Attorney General Schmitt. “The charging documents allege extensive, and horrific, sexual, physical, and mental abuse perpetrated by the Householders. My Office has worked tirelessly to investigate this case and will continue to work around the clock to ensure that justice is obtained in this case.”<br>
<br>
State investigators removed about two dozen girls in mid-august from the facility outside Humansville. The state along with the Cedar County Prosecutor’s Office began outlining a case against the Householders.<br>
<br>
Four former residents of the girls ranch filed civil lawsuits against them. Attorneys at Haden, Cowherd and Bullock in Springfield represent all four of the former residents. The lawsuits list them as “Jane Doe” because of the nature of the allegations. All four allege both physical and sexual abuse during their time at Circle of Hope Girls Ranch. The alleged abuse includes restraining girls on the ground with multiple people for extended periods, refusing restroom breaks even after an accident, forcing girls to remain in push-up position for hours and in solitary confinement for days.<br>
<br>
The first two young women who filed lawsuits lived at Circle of Hope girls ranch in 2014 and 2015. The third Jane Doe arrived at Circle of Hope in 2012 when she was 14-years-old. She claims, similar to Jane Doe two, Boyd Householder made her his “secretary” and repeatedly sexually assaulted her. The lawsuit claims Stephanie Householder was fully aware of the abuse.<br>
<br>
The fourth Jane Doe stayed at the ranch for two years, starting in 2014 when she was also 14-years-old. Similar to the first Jane Doe, she claims the Householder’s son sexually assaulted her multiple times. The lawsuit claims she told Boyd and Stephanie Householder, but they didn’t believe her.<br>
<br>
A former employee says she never witnessed sexual abuse, but did witness and was forced to participate in the physical torture. She says Boyd Householder manipulated Bible verses to defend his actions, that she now knows were not at all Christian.<br>
<br>
Members of a Missouri House committee listened to testimony proposing state oversight for private faith-based boarding schools like Circle of Hope. Since Circle of Hope called itself a Christian organization, it was not required to get a state license, and was unregulated.<br>
<br>
The Attorney General’s Office is continually working to identify and contact victims, and urges anyone who has any information related to abuse at Circle of Hope Girls Ranch to contact the Office at 573-751-0309.</div></blockquote>

This one is from 2011 : Circle of Hope Girls Ranch: Place of Hope or Place of Fraud, Child Neglect and Abuse? <a href="https://chucklestravels.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/circle-of-hope-girls-ranch/" class="postlink">https://chucklestravels.wordpress.com/2 ... rls-ranch/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Recently Chuck Travels was contacted by a mother who reports that her daughter was abused and neglected at Circle of Hope Girls Ranch located in Humansville, Missouri. She and others have alleged that the CEO Boyd Householder made fraudulent statements as well.  Circle of Hope Girls Ranch and Boarding Schools is a tax exempt/non-profit. Many have alleged that Boyd Householder uses Circle of Hope Girls Ranch’s tax exempt status to not only commit fraud against parents, but also abuses and neglects teenage girls. Mr. Householder is the self-described “CEO and Founder of Circle of Hope Girls Ranch. Husband, Father, Grandfather.”<br>
<br>
Householder also calls himself, ‘Gunslinger for God.’  Why one who is entrusted with teenage girls would go around calling himself a “Gunslinger for God’ is beyond comprehension....<br>
<br>
Former “students” of Circle of Hope claim the Mr. Householder screams and spits in girls faces, girls were either force fed or denied food depending on the whim of the staff. If a girl vomited her face was shoved in her vomitus, and much more.  Girls claim that a few of them were made to preform push-ups in horse feces. Parents were charged thousands of dollars for tuition, and $300.00 for uniforms....<br>
<br>
In the same month and year that the website for Circle of Hope claimed to be registered with the Missouri Board of Education, the Missouri Department of Education wrote stating that Circle of Hope Girls' Ranch is not registered with their office.  Circle of Hope lies and uses deceptive marketing practices. </div></blockquote>

Lots of stories on this review site <a href="https://greatnonprofits.org/org/circle-of-hope-girls-ranch-and-boarding-schools" class="postlink">https://greatnonprofits.org/org/circle- ... ng-schools</a><br>
<br>
So the question is, why were they allowed to stay open for so long?</div>

			<div class="content">This link has a  photo of the Householders and video news coverage <a href="https://msn.com/en-us/news/us/missouri-owners-of-girls-boarding-school-charged-with-abuse/ar-BB1esKC4" class="postlink">https://msn.com/en-us/news/us/missouri- ... r-BB1esKC4</a>  archive.is/3LcFO<br>
<br>
Also: <br>
"LIBERTY, Mo. — The owners of a former Christian reform school for girls in southwest Missouri are charged with more than 100 counts alleging they sexually, emotionally and physically abused girls for years.<br>
<br>
Sixteen former residents of the Circle of Hope Girls Ranch in Cedar County say Boyd and Stephanie Householder frequently restrained them with handcuffs, whipped them with belts, taped their mouths shut and struck or punched them for minor offenses such as drinking from a spring or singing."<br>
<br>
..."Attorney General Eric Schmitt said during a news conference Wednesday that the alleged victims also said they were forced to shovel manure for hours on end, stand with their noses against a wall while handcuffed for days at a time and were locked in rooms without beds or lights."<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/state/missouri-reform-school-abuse-charges/63-e926cd00-5ddd-4cb3-9d15-36e2d9bb3bca" class="postlink">https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/state ... e2d9bb3bca</a><br>
<br>
So the Householders, in addition to the abuse they were quick to use, were paid to have slave labor on their ranch (shoveling manure and likely every other job that needed to be done.)<br>
<br>
The Householders are very sick and sadistic people.<br>
<br>
"Schmitt said Boyd Householder also told at least seven girls the “proper way” to commit suicide, and he's accused of forcing a girl to drink at least 220 ounces of water, run a mile until she vomited and then run again."</div>
