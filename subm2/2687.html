He played role in two movies of Matthew Lessner and for which James Alefantis was executive and associate producer, Chapel Perilous and Automatic At Sea:<br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2937630/" class="postlink">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2937630/</a><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4169074/?ref_=rvi_tt" class="postlink">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4169074/?ref_=rvi_tt</a><br><br>
Shooting of Automatic At Sea started in year 2014, from Matthew Lessner Instagram profile called Montelomax:<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ow6z9DGwQi/" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/ow6z9DGwQi/</a><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835568879958622210/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
In October 2014 he posted "Satan" writing picture just after he posted his "Automatic At Sea" post on Instagram:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835571050418405446/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/u1OBhAmwUv/" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/u1OBhAmwUv/</a><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835571447010689124/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
In December 2015 he posted "pizza scene" from the movie and tagged it "secret pizza":<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-znjtJGwR_/" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/-znjtJGwR_/</a><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835569820166520852/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Footage for movie was being shot on Martha's Vineyard when Obama was vacationing down the road:<br><a href="https://nofilmschool.com/2018/01/automatic-at-sea-lessner" class="postlink">https://nofilmschool.com/2018/01/automa ... ea-lessner</a><br><br>
Martha's Vineyard is island where Dershowitz was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein, also island where Rothschilds (Lynn Forester, friend of David Brock, ex boyfriend of Alefantis, also probably she knows Alefantis because he was invited with Brock to her house) and Obamas have their mansions:<br><a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/politics/2020/01/24/2-lawyers-on-trump-defense-team-shared-epstein-as-a-client/" class="postlink">https://www.ksat.com/news/politics/2020 ... -a-client/</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In his 2019 book, “Guilt by Accusation: The Challenge of Proving Innocence in the Age of #metoo,” Dershowitz offers a detailed rebuttal to Guiffre. He states that meeting Epstein was “just about the worst thing that ever happened to me.” He was introduced to Epstein in late 1990s by their mutual friend Lynn Forester de Rothschild while vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard.</div></blockquote>

Obamas house on Martha's Vineyard was described by some as high end cult site: <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/news/0P5Mtv6I/people-are-confused-by-the-obamas-weird-summer-house-a-high-end-cult-compound" class="postlink">https://www.newsbreak.com/news/0P5Mtv6I ... t-compound</a><br><br>

Additionally it's island where John Podesta was in August/September 2014 and where famous "pizza related map" (that people thought was code for something) was supposed to be left. John Podesta was planning to be there already in first half of August 2014:<br><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43058" class="postlink">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43058</a><br><br>
And he was there August/September 2014 when Automatic at Sea production was reaching its climax, and he was asked about "pizza related map", Martha's Vineyard mentioned in lower part of the conversation:<br><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795" class="postlink">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</a><br><br>
On IMDB they changed description after Pizzagate broke out, from "secret pizza" to "secret soda" but pizza cultish like scene is still in the movie:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107084457if_/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4169074/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20161107084 ... _=tt_ov_pl</a> - secret pizza archive from November 2016<br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4169074/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl" class="postlink">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4169074/pl ... _=tt_ov_pl</a> - secret soda after Pizzagate broke out for good<br><br>
I've watched the movie and made screenshots so I actually will show you what is inside of it, or some parts of it. Movie is basically about Eve, Swedish girl trapped on island with weirdo and dangerous Peter (played by David Henry Gerson) as he is described by other girl living with them on this island.<br><br>

First of all you have James Alefantis listed as executive producer when the movie starts:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835551282638749716/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
To be listed as executive producer James Alefantis needed to give at least 10,000$ for the movie if that's the way he got listed in credits: <br><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/caesura/automatic-at-sea-a-feature-film-exploring-hidden-r" class="postlink">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ca ... g-hidden-r</a><br><br>
You have two scenes in this movies where book called "Three Books of Occult Philosophy" is being shown:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835551174333693962/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835550228265959464/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Here's the deal with the book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Books_of_Occult_Philosophy" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Boo ... Philosophy</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Three Books of Occult Philosophy (De Occulta Philosophia libri III) is Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's study of occult philosophy, acknowledged as a significant contribution to the Renaissance philosophical discussion concerning the powers of magic, and its relationship with religion. The first book was printed in 1531 in Paris, Cologne, and Antwerp, while the full three volumes first appeared in Cologne in 1533.[1]<br><br>
The three books deal with Elemental, Celestial and Intellectual magic. The books outline the four elements, astrology, kabbalah, numerology, angels, God's names, the virtues and relationships with each other as well as methods of utilizing these relationships and laws in medicine, scrying, alchemy, ceremonies, origins of what are from the Hebrew, Greek and Chaldean context.<br><br>
These arguments were common amongst other hermetic philosophers at the time and before. In fact, Agrippa's interpretation of magic is similar to the authors Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola and Johann Reuchlin's synthesis of magic and religion, and emphasize an exploration of nature</div></blockquote>

There are also scenes like this in the movie, very cultish stuff, some figure you can sit on, Eve sits on it:<br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835551881513795619/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835552687901638666/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
There are scenes like this that maybe are trying to tell us something with 3D illusion book "Magic Eye II: Now You See It...":<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835552923278114856/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835550174247125032/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Here Eve holds little goat: <br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835586063963521055/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
There's also this scene with Eve surrounded by flowers but unlike the trailer it doesn't have her eating pizza, that will be later in the movie:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835550518545088532/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Eve is getting trapped with bizarre vision of Peter (David Henry Gerson) turning into horned Greek god "Pan":<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835551061284487168/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835558389710323732/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Seeing visions of naked women on trees:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835553247812386866/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
She also tells to Peter she saw a dragon or dragonfly, in other scene he is performing to song, on his back there is a dragon:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835554243246161950/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
When it comes to dragon, it is one of the description for Satan:<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpents_in_the_Bible#Ancient_serpent" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpents_ ... nt_serpent</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Serpent (Greek: ὄφις;[39] Trans: Ophis, /ˈo.fis/; "snake", "serpent") occurs in the Book of Revelation as the "ancient serpent"[40] or "old serpent"(YLT) used to describe "the dragon",[20:2] Satan[41] the Adversary,(YLT) who is the devil.[12:9, 20:2] This serpent is depicted as a red seven-headed dragon having ten horns, each housed with a diadem. The serpent battles Michael the Archangel in a War in Heaven which results in this devil being cast out to the earth.</div></blockquote>

When she says to Peter that she wants to escape from island Peter turns into horned creature again:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835553674864361502/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Then she is seen with guy with horns in cultish like scene with huge fire beside them:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835550298143588352/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
In one scene Peter jokingly talks about "being sacrificed" but I can't show that unfortunately, subtitles are only for moments when Eve talks in Swedish. There's also moon theme repeating in the movie from the beginning of it, almost in ritualistic manner. Eve is asked by Peter what she knows about moon, she answers that she knows about tidal forces of the moon that impact behavior of waters in the oceans. And then the moon is sometimes reappearing throughout the movie with camera focus on it.<br><br>
While being trapped in the bizarre vision she is finally trapped so much that she isn't trying to escape anymore, she joins weirdo girlfriend of Peter. Also in one vision she is eating pizza at night, very strange:<br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835550372671520799/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
At the end of the movie Martha's Vineyard location is mentioned with list of many people but also Alice Waters is being thanked as one of the people on the list:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835578253456310312/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
And if that's the same person as Alice Louise Waters then she is the one who sent something with writing Moloch Maschine on it to James Alefantis:<br><a href="https://searchvoat.co/search.php?t=alice+waters&amp;co=on" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/search.php?t=alice+waters&amp;co=on</a><br><br><a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/james-alefantis-instagram_files/35bde0b4fd1c623655f7403f5270f4ef60a98c36.png" class="postlink">https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/ja ... a98c36.png</a><br>
Source: <a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/james-alefantis-instagram" class="postlink">https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/ja ... -instagram</a><br><br>
Moloch obviously is deity associated with child sacrifice:<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Moloch (/ˈmoʊlɒk/; Masoretic מֹלֶךְ‎ mōlek; Ancient Greek: Μόλοχ, Latin: Moloch; also Molech or Molek) is a name or term that appears several times in the Hebrew Bible, primarily in the book of Leviticus. The Bible strongly condemns practices associated with Moloch, which appear to have included child sacrifice.</div></blockquote>

<br><strong class="text-strong">------------------------------------<br>
CHAPEL PERILOUS - ANOTHER MOVIE ASSOCIATED WITH MATTHEW LESSNER, DAVID HENRY GERSON AND JAMES ALEFANTIS</strong><br><br>
This one is available for free on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-Bbbck2Nk" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-Bbbck2Nk</a> It was produced before Automatic at Sea.<br><br>
Let's start with the name of the movie, Chapel Perilous, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_perilous" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_perilous</a><br><br>
One of the descriptions of it says:<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Chapel perilous" is also a term referring to a psychological state in which an individual is uncertain whether some course of events was affected by a supernatural force, or was a product of their own imagination. It was used by writer and philosopher Robert Anton Wilson in his 1977 book Cosmic Trigger. According to Wilson, being in this state leads the subject to become either paranoid or an agnostic.[citation needed] In his opinion there is no third way.[citation needed]</div></blockquote>

Interestingly Robert Anton Wilson used Aleister Crowley as his inspiration for the books:<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson</a>
 <blockquote class="uncited"><div>Wilson, a well-known author in occult and Neo-Pagan circles, used Aleister Crowley as a main character in his 1981 novel Masks of the Illuminati, also included some elements of H. P. Lovecraft's work in his novels, and at times claimed to have perceived encounters with magical "entities" (when asked whether these entities seemed "real", he answered they seemed "real enough," although "not as real as the IRS" but "easier to get rid of", and later decided that his experiences may have emerged from "just my right brain hemisphere talking to my left").</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Among Wilson's 35 books,[17] and many other works, perhaps his best-known volumes remain the cult classic series[18] The Illuminatus! Trilogy (1975), co-authored with Shea. Advertised as "a fairy tale for paranoids," the three books—The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple, and Leviathan, soon offered as a single volume—philosophically and humorously examined, among many other themes, occult and magical symbolism and history, the counterculture of the 1960s, secret societies, data concerning author H. P. Lovecraft and author and occultist Aleister Crowley, and American paranoia about conspiracies and conspiracy theories. The book was intended to poke fun at the conspiratorial frame of mind.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Trigger_I:_The_Final_Secret_of_the_Illuminati" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Tr ... Illuminati</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Cosmic Trigger I deals with Wilson's experiences during a time in which he put himself through a process of "self-induced brain change" as well as vignettes of his earlier life. The main discovery of this process—which, he tells us, is known in certain traditions as Chapel perilous—is that "reality" (although a noun in most Indo-European language systems, and therefore[citation needed] commonly conceptualized as being a definite, unchanging "'thing") is mutable and subjective to the observer.</div></blockquote>

Crowley himself was being accused of endorsing human sacrifice:<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>He was also accused of advocating human sacrifice, largely because of a passage in Book 4 in which he stated that "A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim" and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to ejaculation, something not realised by his critics.[257]</div></blockquote>

So going back to the movie, David Henry Gerson is playing as Levi, some say this is anagram for "evil". Anagram is simply word created from letters of another word.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-Bbbck2Nk" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-Bbbck2Nk</a><br><br>
It starts with the one eye symbolism:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835558694652739655/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
That one eye on hand was used by Montelomax profile picture (Matthew Lessner profile) on YouTube before people started accusing him in the comments of being part of the Illuminati, and they've started accusing him before Pizzagate broke out btw which you can still find on the link that is not archived and when you scroll through the old comments (before 2016) and here's his archived profile picture from 2014:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140118235736if_/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-Bbbck2Nk" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20140118235 ... j-Bbbck2Nk</a><br><br>
Then snake symbolism appears in the movie: <br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835584357937840158/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
There are snakes on David Henry Gerson (playing as Levi in the movie) trousers if you look closely (guy on the right):<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835559034102874182/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
They are introducing "The Cosmic Serpent" Book about ayahuasca and secret message encoded in DNA which can be found through ritualistic brew like ayahuasca:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835559143506313276/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cosmic_Serpent" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cosmic_Serpent</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Investigating the connections between shamanism and molecular biology, Narby hypothesizes that shamans may be able to access information at the molecular level through the ingestion of entheogens, specifically ayahuasca.[1] Biophysicist Jacques Dubochet criticized Narby for not testing his hypothesis.[1]</div></blockquote>

Further in the movie Levi opens package he received from black guy who sits beside him, there's a snake in the package:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835559316941045810/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Levi is growing horns through weird ritual that allows him to discover secret of his DNA, horns are direct sign from the heavens according to guy leading him through ritual:<br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835559723889590302/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835560130095087676/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Woman with snake at the end of the movie: <br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835560267789500447/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
James Alefantis was associate producer for Chapel Perilous:<br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/835560483553148998/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>
Serpents are ofc associated with devil and evil powers in the Bible:<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpents_in_the_Bible" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpents_in_the_Bible</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Serpent (Greek: ὄφις;[39] Trans: Ophis, /ˈo.fis/; "snake", "serpent") occurs in the Book of Revelation as the "ancient serpent"[40] or "old serpent"(YLT) used to describe "the dragon",[20:2] Satan[41] the Adversary,(YLT) who is the devil.[12:9, 20:2] This serpent is depicted as a red seven-headed dragon having ten horns, each housed with a diadem.</div></blockquote></div>

Here's our synopsis (if you're into that sort of thing): On a whim, Eve (young Swedish traveler) accepts an invitation from Peter (wealthy heir) to vacation on his family’s private island off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter and that something is not quite right on this mysterious island. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of her surroundings dissolves, and Eve finds herself trapped in an unstable reality punctuated by feverish visions, dimensional shifting and <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><span style="text-decoration:underline">secret pizza</span></span></span>.<br><br><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/0qrkxj.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/0qrkxj.jpg</a> David Henry Gerson in <span style="color:#FF0040">James Cagney's barn</span> in a set still by Zach Lanoue [<strong class="text-strong">EDIT : THE IMAGES FOR THIS ARE BEING 'DISAPPEARED'</strong> <a href="https://archive.ph/4WvT7" class="postlink">https://archive.ph/4WvT7</a>]<br><br>

David approached Matthew immediately after the screening and told him that he was interested in helping him make his next film.

A number of points from that WaPo article on the Finders cult. I'm going to look at the journalists who wrote that piece in 1987 - Saundra Saperstein and Victoria Churchville... <span style="color:#FF0040">Saundra Saperstein, who has been the media director of the Sundance Film Festival since its inception</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">History of the Sundance Film Festival</span>  <br><br>
On the arts side, there was Sterling van Wagenen, a Brigham Young University film school graduate; on the commercial side, Utah State Film Commissioner John Earle. Together with a small group of associates, they decided it would be an excellent idea to launch a film festival for the state - the Utah/US Film Festival.<br><br>
To oversee the event, the management of the fledgling festival tapped its network of friends and colleagues to put together a board of directors. A local Utah resident since the late 1960s, Robert Redford became involved as the festival board's inaugural chairman through Van Wagenen (at the time, <span style="color:#FF0040">Redford was married to Van Wagenen's cousin Lola</span>). Funding for the festival came predominantly from Earle through the Utah Film Commission, but it also relied on industry sponsors and donations from wealthy friends of those involved....The first Utah/US Film Festival kicked off in Salt Lake City in September 1978...Having Redford's name associated with the festival helped the young team garner interest from studios and distributors who would have probably otherwise not returned their calls.<br><br>
Lola  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lola_Van_Wagenen" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lola_Van_Wagenen</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Van Wagenen was born in Provo, Utah, in December 1938. She was raised in a Mormon family, but as an adult has explored other sources of religious and philosophical thought. She met her first husband, actor Robert Redford, in Los Angeles in 1957.[6] They were married on September 12, 1958, in Provo, Utah, following a secret wedding a few months earlier in Las Vegas, Nevada. They divorced in 1985.<br><br>
She married George Burrill, Ph.D., the founder of the international development firm ARD,[10] on July 17, 2002, in Shelburne, Vermont. Burrill is the Honorary Consul from New Zealand to Vermont.[11] He was a US delegate to the United States New Zealand Partnership Forum in 2011, held in Christchurch, New Zealand, when a devastating earthquake struck the city.. Since the 1970s, Van Wagenen has served on the Board of Directors or in other capacities with various charitable organizations, including Shelburne Farms,[16] the Vermont Historical Society[17] and the New York Women’s Foundation.[18] She served on the Task Force on Appropriate Technology with the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment in 1977.[19] In 1979 she was a member of the National Commission on the International Year of the Child.</div></blockquote>

George Burrill founded an international professional services consulting firm, ARD Inc., and served as Chief Executive Officer from the firm’s inception in 1977 until 2007 when it was acquired by TetraTech. ARD was one of the premiere international economic development consulting firms in the USA with <span style="color:#FF0040">clients ranging from the World Bank to the US Department of State and foreign governments</span>. Focused mainly on the developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the transitional states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe the firm developed a project portfolio in the areas of agriculture, environment and natural resources, water supply, renewable energy, financial analysis, and building democracies and the institutions and civic societies that sustain them.

The Cagney family sold the farm in the 1980s, and it was later used as a commune, according to Ms. Bodnar. Boston restaurateurs Patrick Lyons and Sean Gildea bought the property for $4.1 million in late 2012.<br><br>
Mr. Lyons and Mr. Gildea, who are friends and business partners, said they bought the property under the name You Dirty Rat LLC in homage to Mr. Cagney. They each planned to build vacation homes on the property, which can be split into several different parcels. But Mr. Lyons said he and his wife have since decided to keep their current Vineyard home on the South Shore, while Mr. Gildea ended up buying a different property.<br><br>
Mr. Lyons is known for his role in making Boston’s Lansdowne Street a nightlife destination and owns a number of restaurants and nightlife spots in Boston. Mr. Gildea co-owns Blue Dragon and is co-owner of a commercial real-estate firm.</div></blockquote>

....Parts of Home Alone 2 was filmed in Trumps Plaza Hotel...<br><br>
But I digress, let me get back to the Gangster Film in Home Alone I and II that were specifically created for these films.

James Cagney, famous for playing cinematic tough guys, once owned an island in Newport Harbor, CA. Known as Collins island, it's located on the western tip of Balboa Island and has since been divided into eight separate residential properties. One of those properties is now on the market for $10 million....<br><br>
Cagney, who died in 1986 at age 86, owned the island from 1938 to 1948, and it’s rumored that he may have even won it in a poker game. Off screen, Cagney he was a fan of the seas, and was reported to have had boats harbored on both the East and the West coasts. Although he’s known for playing gangsters in “The Public Enemy,” “Angels with Dirty Faces,” and “White Heat,” he was a song-and-dance man who won an Academy Award for his role in the musical “Yankee Doodle Dandy.”</div></blockquote>

Lodge History Armstrong Lodge No. 26 A.F. &amp; A.M. was chartered on June, 1870 and could rightly be called the “mother Lodge” of Newport, because of the rapid rise in membership during the 1940’s and 50’s. It would help four Lodges get their start in the Newport area. Included would be Ionic Lodge No. 31 in 1950, Unity Lodge No. 32 in 1955, Christiana Lodge No. 35 in 1963 and High Noon Lodge No. 38 in 1978. The events of the last fifty years have shone brightly from the labors of the quarries of Armstrong Lodge No. 26. In addition to the formation of new Lodges they have also had the honor of four of them members being elected <span style="color:#FFFF40"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Grand Master of Masons in Delaware</span></span>; Joseph W. H. Watson, served two terms, in 1880 and 1881, Paul Yearsley in 1947, Arthur G. Craig in 1965 and David J. Marianelli in 1989.<br><br>
 After serving as Senior Grand Warden and Deputy Grand Master, Grand Master-elect Edward P. Sturgis was called from labor on September 15, 1974 about two weeks prior to his scheduled installation as a very young Grand Master at the age of 40. Brother “Ed” was a hard working Master Mason who had been awarded nearly every honor possible as a DeMolay, including the DeMolay Cross of Honor. Bill Clinton was a DeMolay. Although not a "Masonic organization" as such, DeMolay is considered to be part of the general "family" of Masonic and associated organizations, along with other youth groups<br><br>
 While many brethren have been involved in the in the maintenance of the Newport Masonic Temple over the years. Though they have been called from labor, their devotion to serving the membership in providing a well-maintained facility will long be remembered and appreciated by the various bodies that use the facility.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div> In 1964, PGM Paul Yearsley retired as Treasurer of the Lodge after twenty-two years of service.

Through the influence of PGM Craig, the early English Table Lodge was reconstituted at Armstrong Lodge. It proved to be a very popular event and it was not unusual to have 250 to 300 brethren in attendance. <br>
 As part of the 100th Anniversary Celebration of Armstrong Lodge, a public installation of officers was held at the H.C. Conrad High School Athletic Field on June 27, 1970. Much hard work had to be done to make this event a success, as the field had not been in use for some time. In addition, the Lodge furniture had to be moved to the field as well. There were over 200 family members and friends who watched from the bleachers. </div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

On August 6, 2018 Barack Obama dined at The Cardboard Box, a new restaurant on Martha's Vineyard: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmKZ7mTFB5_/?taken-by=thecardboardboxmv" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/BmKZ7mTFB5_ ... boardboxmv</a><br><br>
Owner Ben De Forest's explanation of the name: <em class="text-italics">It’s called Cardboard Box because it’s been my belief for a long time that if the food is great, someone will sit in a cardboard box to eat it.<br></em><br><br>
The Cardboard Box opened on May 1, 2018. May 1 happens to be during Walpurgisnacht, April 30-May 1, which is tied with Halloween as the highest Satanic holiday. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BiPnJEYFAhr/?taken-by=thecardboardboxmv" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/BiPnJEYFAhr ... boardboxmv</a><br><br>
Notice the logo. The faceless man in the dark suit and hat, holding a box with a heart on it, is called The Messenger Man. <span style="color:#FFFF40">The artist Traeger di Pietro's website</span>: <a href="https://www.traegerdipietro.com/" class="postlink">https://www.traegerdipietro.com/</a><br><br>
The Cardboard Box restaurant used “kidnappers’ ransom note” style cut-out words, a cut-out of a little boy, and wrote the word “dinner” with pasta: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl-pr_8H5gS/?taken-by=thecardboardboxmv" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl-pr_8H5gS ... boardboxmv</a><br><br>
..The box with the heart on it is suspicious, and, links below may suggest The Messenger Man references the Finders Cult, due to his dark suit and role as “a messenger.” A similar hat was noticed in a Finders group house. ..<br><br>

Di Pietro worked with Island students with autism to create art with a message — the most important things in life are free. Using a lot of color, stars, rainbows, and hearts, the students and the artist have created the perfect backdrop for the Messenger Man, di Pietro’s faceless man in the black suit that pops up in his artwork and around the Island; he’s on the logo for the Oak Bluffs eatery, the Cardboard Box.<br><br>
..The Artism for Autism fundraiser for IAG came about serendipitously. Jhenn Pillsworth, director of the Field Gallery in West Tisbury, is a board member for IAG as well as Friends of Family Planning (FFP), and when FFP raised enough money with proceeds from its annual art show at the Ag Hall to purchase a permanent Island home for their clinic, they decided to pass the event on to the IAG. Pillsworth explained that FFP, after putting the art show together for 28 years, is passing the torch.<br><br>
..The IAG was founded more than 10 years ago by two moms, Marcy Bettencourt and Kate DeVane, who were looking for resources for their then kindergarten-age sons. Their sons are now teenagers, and the IAG is working to provide permanent support for both young children and adults with autism. They’ve developed an afterschool program for students ages 5 to 17 that gives them access to the YMCA, the Barn Bowl &amp; Bistro, Misty Meadows, the FARM Institute, SailMV, and Rick Bausman’s drumming group. The IAG is now raising funds to develop a home base that could provide job training, work, social opportunities, and other activities for people with autism and other disabilities.<br><br>
..Two fun projects, #themessengerman and #onthewarehousefloor, are di Pietro’s creations that spark the imagination and go beyond pieces of art. <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">“On the warehouse floor”</span></span> began <span style="color:#FF0040">when the artist worked for Pepsi-Cola</span> and instead of loading trucks, he’d snap photos of a crack in the wall or a wet spot on the ceiling and turn it into a rendering of a couple in an embrace or an eagle swooping down to grab a fish out of the ocean. </div></blockquote></div>

James Cagney’s Island Refuge <a href="https://mvmagazine.com/news/2011/05/01/james-cagney%E2%80%99s-island-refuge" class="postlink">https://mvmagazine.com/news/2011/05/01/ ... and-refuge</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>By the mid-eighties, the much-loved Cagney farm had been sold. The paper trail regarding ownership becomes complicated at this point but the new residents were a communal group whose members included Thomas Hart Benton’s daughter, Jessie Benton. Jessie was among the founders of the Boston-based commune known as the Fort Hill Community, which had achieved national notoriety in the 1970s amid allegations of drug use, violence, intimidation, and mind-control tactics. The estate became one of a handful of properties scattered across the United States acquired by the family collective. Its nucleus was Mel Lyman, a charismatic Boston-area folk musician and writer whose controversial lifestyle and outspoken philosophies were sensationalized in a two-part Rolling Stone magazine cover story in 1971 likening him to the notorious California cult figure Charles Manson.<br><br>
..The commune, which referred to itself as a family collective, repeatedly denied all claims of wrongdoing but retreated from the public eye, reemerging in the 1980s (following Lyman’s death at age forty in 1978) for interviews with People magazine, The Kansas City Star, The Boston Globe, and The Boston Herald, among other publications. By then, two decades after its inception, the commune had raised a generation of children and forged a reputation for legitimacy as operators of Fort Hill Construction, respected builders and remodelers of homes in California, New York, and Boston.</div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Once-Notorious ‘60s Commune Evolves Into Respectability : After 19 Years the Lyman Family Prospers as Craftsmen and Farmers </span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201205195626/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-08-04-vw-4546-story.html" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20201205195 ... story.html</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Aug. 4, 1985<br><br>
Today they are prosperous builders who remodel homes for the stars, the 117 members of a notorious ‘60s commune who a decade ago wrote off the rest of the world as hopelessly corrupt and withdrew so completely that they adopted their own calendar to number the years. They are the Lyman Family, an eclectic band of musicians, artists, writers, philosophy students and psychic explorers who comprise one of the few ‘60s communes to survive the era.<br><br>
The 60 adults have stuck together for 19 years, evolving from poverty, drugs and even a bank robbery into an unusual version of familial joy with 49 children, 10 of whom are now adults. There are eight other young adults who have joined the Family in recent years after growing up elsewhere...<br><br>
..Prosperous today because of their industriousness and a small fortune inherited by one of their leaders, the Lymans own two Hollywood Hills mansions worth at least $4 million, with formal gardens, a peaceful stone pond filled with koi, a swimming pool and a classroom for the children. There is a huge underground garage where they keep their old white Lincoln limousine, two sports cars and a luxurious recreational vehicle, and surrounding all of this is a high brick and mortar wall.. They also own a scenic 280-acre Kansas farm, a Manhattan loft, a hilltop compound of eight residences above Boston’s poor Roxbury section and a Martha’s Vineyard retreat, plus three deep-sea pleasure fishing boats.<br><br>
..Master craftsmen, the Lymans remodel homes for actors Dustin Hoffman and Richard Chamberlain, <span style="color:#FF0040">producers Steven Spielberg and Larry Gelbart</span> and others made rich by Hollywood. Their own homes reflect extraordinary craftsmanship. In one Kansas farmhouse the wooden banister’s finial is a delicate carving of a nude woman. Lavish rugs that one of the women hooks enhance the Hollywood Hills mansions.<br><br>
...They came from diverse backgrounds. The children of Kennedy men and Brooklyn laborers, they all became ‘60s cultural revolutionaries, witnesses at the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. They dropped out of Harvard, Brandeis and Michigan State to seek God in vials of acid; they found him in an odd-looking banjo player named Mel Lyman.<br><br>
..Deny Worshiping Manson<br><br>
Today, Family members insist they never worshiped Manson, never put his picture above a vase of flowers that were changed daily, as several outsiders report they saw. Their deeds back then were no more crazy than the times, they say.<br><br>
“We did a lot of outrageous things just to get people to open their eyes, to see what they were blind to,” said Eve Lyman, one of seven women who bore Lyman’s 12 children.<br><br>
Then, in 1973, three commune members robbed a federal bank, saying they were protesting Richard Nixon’s involvement in Watergate. Boston police killed one bandit. (Another bandit, actor Mark Frechette, the star of “Zabriskie Point,” director Michelangelo Antonioni’s savage look at American decadence, later died in prison in what authorities said was an accident. The third bandit, Sheldon (Terry) Bernhard, 43, served his term and has rejoined the family.)<br><br>
After that some of the commune children burglarized houses on Martha’s Vineyard and burned them down to cover their misdeeds.<br><br>
The Family soon withdrew from the world, believing themselves badly misunderstood.<br></div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content"><span style="color:#00FF40">The Mel Lyman Personality Cult Revisited by Kliph Nesteroff</span> <a href="https://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/03/the-mel-lyman-personality-cult-revisited.html" class="postlink">https://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/03/ ... sited.html</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"I tell you I am the greatest man in the world and it doesn't trouble me in the least." - Mel Lyman<br><br>
It seems unlikely that a scrawny, disheveled kid wearing a sailor hat and oversized military coat could actually hold power over one hundred people, let alone convince them he was God. A 1966 Oscar-nominated film called Festival is the closest look at this man we have today. The stark, black and white, cinema-vérité style documentary follows the goings-on at <span style="color:#FF0040">The Newport Folk Festival</span>. It opens with a shot of Mel Lyman, flashing a toothy grin, playing harmonica with The Jim Kweskin Jug Band. He appears happy and sweet, young and sheepish. He looks like he could be the malnourished spokesperson for a brand of fish n’ chips. Many conclude that Charles Manson modeled himself after him.<br><br>
Three years later Dick Cavett spoke into a television camera. “Will you welcome please Daria Halprin and Mark Frechette!” With that the young couple walked across the stage of The Dick Cavett Show and shook hands with fellow panelists Mel Brooks and Rex Reed. The two young stars of Michelangelo Antonioni’s Zabriskie Point didn’t smile. They didn’t wave to the audience. They sat down and stared off camera. It was one of the most awkward interviews Dick Cavett would ever conduct. Each question was greeted with long moments of hesitation. The interview subjects acted as if they were appearing against their will.<br><br>
Not long after that awkward televised exchange, Frechette watched a close friend go down in a hail of bullets. Frechette himself would die under mysterious circumstances when he was asphyxiated by a barbell in a Massachusetts prison. It was obvious to Mel Brooks, Rex Reed and Cavett’s entire viewing audience that these kids weren’t normal - but nobody could pinpoint why. The world eventually learned that Daria Halprin and Mark Frechette were emotionally captivated players in an unnerving countryside family of young, hippie outsiders, or as Cavett refers to it today, "a cult that didn't kill anyone." In 1970, when Cavett said to his guests, “I understand you two live in a commune,” Frechette responded tersely. “It’s not a commune. It’s a community … and the purpose is to serve [our leader] Mel Lyman.”<br><br>
The Harvard area had nurtured a nineteen fifties bohemian culture that eventually fostered folk luminaries like Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, bands such as The Lovin Spoonful and The Chambers Brothers, and a wealth of other underground notables. In 1961 Fritz Richmond was the focal point of this burgeoning scene, the leader of a small folk band making the rounds of Boston coffeehouses. Richmond was described by his peers, with only the slightest tinge of irony, as “the foremost washtub bassist in the world.” A few years later the obscure musician would join the West Coast hippie movement and leave a lasting influence on the counterculture as a whole. Roger McGuin of The Byrds says it was Richmond who popularized “the granny glasses look,” eventually appropriated by Jerry Garcia, John Lennon and legions of conforming flower children. Richmond’s band The Hoppers also profoundly affected a frequent New England coffeehouse patron named Jim Kweskin.<br><br>
..The Family tried to recruit high profile members in the hopes they could be used to further the vague Lyman philosophy. The recruitment campaign brought in notables such as Owen deLong, a former speechwriter for Robert Kennedy, George Peper, an assistant to CBS President Don West, and a recently discovered nobody turned actor named Mark Frechette. Clearly, Lyman could not just captivate a series of conformist dummies, but some highly educated people. In the late sixties Mark Frechette was panhandling and picking up odd jobs around Boston, living the typical life of a late sixties drop-out. He stumbled across a copy of Avatar. Frechette was instantly captivated by the musings of Mel Lyman and wanted to join his controversial community.<br><br>
...the final day Lyman Family member Christopher Thein was seen alive. During their hold-up of Brigham Circle Bank, he was shot several times by Boston police and killed. Mark Frechette was sentenced to five years in Norfolk State Prison. Still motivated to protest Watergate, the two surviving bank robbers mounted an in-prison play called The Whitehouse Transcripts based on a television special of the same name. Terry Bernhard played Richard Nixon and Frechette directed. Joining the inmate population to watch the performance were Massachusetts political notables Michael Dukakis and Ted Kennedy...<br><br>
The last week of September 1975, Frechette’s body was found lifeless in the prison recreation room. A barbell weighing close to two hundred pounds was sitting on his throat. It was considered a freak accident. Death, financial woes, splitting factions, a tarnished reputation thanks to Rolling Stone and a perceived association with the Manson Family helped tear apart Mel Lyman’s peculiar world. Members continued to wheel and deal in real estate and run a profitable construction company, but they retreated further from public view. </div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Mark Frechette</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Frechette" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Frechette</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mark Frechette (December 4, 1947 – September 27, 1975)[1] was an American film actor. He is best known for his attempted bank robbery and the lead role in the 1970 film Zabriskie Point, <span style="color:#FF0040">directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, in which he was cast despite his lack of previous acting experience.</span>..<br><br>
Despite the film's being a critical and box office failure, Frechette enjoyed a period of considerable publicity, his face gracing the covers of Look magazine[3] in November 1969 and Rolling Stone magazine on March 7, 1970.[4] He appeared on the cover of Sight and Sound, the March 1970 and September 1970 covers of Films and Filming along with several other magazines. He also appeared in the November 1969 issue of Vogue in a fashion shoot. He appeared on The Merv Griffin Show alongside Abbie Hoffman when the latter controversially wore the American flag as a shirt and Frechette got in a fight with another guest, which was later discussed during his appearance on The Dick Cavett Show in April 1970 with his Zabriskie Point co-star Daria Halprin. He and Daria were romantically involved for a time after the film and were often referred to as the first counter-culture couple. <br><br>
....<span style="color:#FF0040">In the early 1960s, Frechette was allegedly one of several victims of sexual abuse by Rev. Laurence Francis Xavier Brett of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport in Connecticut.</span></div></blockquote></div>

The day after we ran into him at Peter Norton’s place and, later, Peter and Melinda Farrelly’s party, he was back at it, hanging out with a group of Nobel Prize winners before joining a few friends at <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#FF0040">Patrick and Kristina Lyons</span></span>’s spread in Chilmark. The next day, we again bumped into him at an event, held at the enormous compound of millionaire trial lawyer James Ferraro, honoring Morgan Freeman. (The host had several of the Oscar winner’s movies playing on large-screen TVs throughout the house.) Dershowitz and his wife, Carolyn Cohen, were there, chatting with others poolside and sampling some of the to-die-for apps prepped by party planner Patrie Grace and caterer Jaime Hamlin. The next night? A poker game at Peter and Ronni Simon’s house, where Dershowitz played Texas Hold ’em with “Curb Your Enthusiam’’ crank Larry David, filmmaker Farrelly, island insurance man Bob Mone, and Sox vice chairman <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">David Ginsberg</span></span>.

The revelations began when former professional footballers waived their rights to anonymity and talked publicly about being abused by former coaches and scouts in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. This led to a surge of further allegations, as well as allegations that some clubs had covered them up...Echoing similar revelations in the 1990s, the initial 2016 allegations centred on abuse of young players at Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City due to the clubs' associations with Barry Bennell (previously convicted of sexual abuse offences in the US, in 1995, and in the UK, in 1998) who, on 29 November 2016, was charged with new offences. ..<br><br>

			<div class="content">Once there was a masonic camp for kids on Balboa Island. Originally called Camp Collins, it later became Camp Tucker after William Collins sold the island and left. Via Balboa Island Museum #newportbeach #collnsisland
<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/hxfi22.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Masonic camp on Little Balboa</span> <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zLM5xx87ZYgJ:https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-xpm-2003-04-27-export24443-story.html+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ch" class="postlink">https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/ ... clnk&amp;gl=ch</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 1914, W.S. Collins, an early Newport Beach developer, donated a large parcel of land -- 28 lots -- on Little Balboa Island bordered by Grand Canal, Park Avenue, Abalone and Balboa Avenue to the camp known then as Camp Collins. The parcel would be used by the Masonic Home during the summer -- July to September -- for their children.<br><br>
The first Masonic Home for Children was built for children of deceased Masons in 1899 in Northern California. It moved to the San Gabriel Valley, its final home, in 1915 to the hills of <span style="color:#FF0040">Covina</span> surrounded by orange groves. The Covina home was funded by the Masons devoting time for education of children whose parents did not feel they had the skills to rear their children. Camp Collins was a needed summer diversion for the children because “they had too much time on their hands.”<br><br>
In 1919, John Tucker donated $2,000 to Camp Collins, which became Camp Tucker. This allowed construction of a recreation-cultural building, 21 dormitory tents and several smaller tents. In 1925, 13 buildings were constructed, cement walks were laid and trees were planted....<br><br>
In 1942, because of World War II, <span style="color:#FF0040">Camp Tucker activities carried on at Covina instead of Balboa</span>. Parts of the Camp were leased to Newport Beach Grammar School and the Girls Scouts. Camp Tucker closed in 1944. The superintendent of the Masons noticed that many houses and people were now living close to the camp on the island.<br><br>
“The environment has deteriorated,” he said.<br><br>
A big change came about in the ‘90s when a Newport Beach Mason, Mr. Tait of the Seafarer’s Lodge, donated undisclosed millions, creating a grant to the Masonic Home in Covina with a proviso that they allow children of nonaffiliated Mason families enter their children’s home. Today, his dream has been accomplished. The Masonic Home continues to operate in Covina. With state rules and regulations, they are only allowed 80 kids instead of 175.</div></blockquote></div>

...It’s now known that during the first two decades of the 20th century, Anthony Mann was raised in a bizarre utopian commune known as “Lomaland,” run by the Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society. It was located on 350 acres of Point Loma, a peninsula bordering San Diego Bay...<br><br>
..In its day, the Theosophical movement had a strong presence in Hollywood. The Krotona colony, founded by followers of Annie Besant, was established on 10 acres in lower Beachwood Canyon in 1912, and, in 1924, moved to a 115-acre property in Ojai. That same year, Thomas Ince, “father of the Western”, after dying mysteriously (in some reports, he was shot by William Randolph Hearst), was given a Theosophist funeral. Talbot Mundy, writer of “King of the Kyber Rifles” and “Her Reputation,” lived on the grounds of Lomaland from 1922-1927, and there wrote the Blavatsky-influenced “Om: The Secret of Ahbor Valley.”<br><br>
Lomaland dissolved in the aftermath of the Great Depression of the 1930s and in 1942, the campus was sold to Coronado developer George W. Wood [huge Navy connections]. <span style="color:#FF0040">The Theosophical Society staff and remaining students moved to Covina.</span><br><br>
After Wood died, Dwight Standord helped purchase the property for the struggling <span style="color:#FFFF40">Balboa University</span>, a deal which was finalized on September 15, 1950. That same year, <span style="color:#FFFF40">Balboa University</span> became affiliated with the Southern California Methodist Conference, changed its name to California Western University and relocated to Lomaland. In 1960, the failing Cal Western law school moved from its downtown location to Rohr Hall at Point Loma to join the rest of the school. The law school received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1962. In 1968, California Western University changed its name to United States International University (USIU). The law school, however, retained the name Cal Western. In 1973, the law school relocated from its Point Loma location to the current downtown campus and Pasadena College moved to Point Loma to replace it. USIU moved to Scripps Ranch and in 2001 it merged with California School of Professional Psychology to form Alliant International University.<br><br>
navy connections:<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Geographically, Coronado is a peninsula or a "tied island"; since the completion of a road to the mainland, it is no longer an "island". Coronado is connected to the mainland by a strip of land called the Silver Strand. The Silver Strand, Coronado and North Island (again, not an island), form San Diego Bay...  The Navy still operates Naval Air Station North Island (NASNI or "North Island") on Coronado. On the southern side of the town is Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, a training center for Navy SEALs and Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen (SWCC). Both facilities are part of the larger Naval Base Coronado complex. Coronado has increased in size due to dredge material being dumped on its shoreline and through the natural accumulation of sand. The "Country Club" area on the northwest side of Coronado, the "Glorietta" area and golf course on the southeast side of Coronado, most of the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, most of the Strand Naval Housing, and most of the Coronado Cays (all on the south side of Coronado) were built on dirt dredged from San Diego Bay.</div></blockquote>

That one eye on hand was used by Montelomax profile picture (Matthew Lessner profile) on YouTube before people started accusing him in the comments of being part of the Illuminati, and they've started accusing him before Pizzagate broke out btw which you can still find on the link that is not archived and when you scroll through the old comments (before 2016) and here's his archived profile picture from 2014:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140118235736if_/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-Bbbck2Nk" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20140118235 ... j-Bbbck2Nk</a></div></blockquote>

To sum it up, there's rebellious, leftist ideology driving some of these people and some of them tend to dwell into occult more than mainstream spirituality point of views, like you have in case with Matthew Lessner and people like Gerson [that's why they promote their leftist cause with occult symbolism like they did with "revolt" campaign for The Woods movie]. In case of Maccoby, it looks like she's more like simple environmentalist, nonetheless - a rebel in western society. You can read about her on Globalist, she was born in Mexico City:<br><br><a href="https://www.theglobalist.com/contributors/nora-maccoby/" class="postlink">https://www.theglobalist.com/contributors/nora-maccoby/</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Nora Maccoby<br><br>

Will you be at the Vineyard at any time during that period, and, if so, would you like to get together?</div></blockquote><script data-cfasync="false" src="https://searchvoat.co/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script></div>

			<div class="content">Here's email from March 2014, Sandler discussing vacation on Martha's Vineyard with John Podesta, 23 August is supposed to be arrival date, 2 September departure date.<br><br><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52344" class="postlink">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52344</a><br><br>
Here Sandler is talking about finalizing few details about Martha's Vineyard with John Podesta:<br><br><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31313" class="postlink">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31313</a><br><br>
Here's email that John Podesta and his wife were supposed to visit Martha's Vineyard. Made in August 2014:<br><br><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43058" class="postlink">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43058</a><br><br>
Here Sandler is saying to John Podesta they arrived on Martha's Vineyard:<br><br><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54496" class="postlink">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54496</a><br><br>
And here's email from September 2 2014 where he is being asked by someone who is likely still on Martha's Vineyard about so called "pizza related map":<br><br><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795" class="postlink">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</a><br><br>
So maybe he was already out of this place however he was there around that time and asked about "pizza related map" by person - Sandler - who was there, or it seems so. When you scroll down you'll see Sandler is still discussing details about Martha's Vineyard island.</div>

			<div class="content">Anons pointed something interesting. Music for Automatic at Sea was made by Rene Hell: <br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/836710118817136681/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>

Maybe just unfortunate coincidence, who knows.<br><br>
Another guy I've found in credits beside Alice Waters, he is Logan Sandler:<br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/837114038230974524/Alice_Waters.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... Waters.png</a><br><br>

That movie includes themes of human trafficking:<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Cargo" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Cargo</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Following a devastating loss, Nadine (Dree Hemingway) and Lewis (Keith Stanfield) retreat to a small Bahamian island where Nadine's family has kept a house for many years. As they try to heal and move forward with their relationship, the community on the island shows signs of unraveling—with the island's mayor, Roy (Robert Wisdom), squaring off against Doughboy (Leonard Earl Howze), a human trafficker who manipulates the impressionable homeless teenager Myron (Sam Dillon) into assisting with his smuggling operation.</div></blockquote>

Another guy listed as executive producer beside James Alefantis is Todd Remis:<br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/837053073364353073/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Silver_Lake" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Silver_Lake</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sam is an aimless 33-year-old in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, interested in conspiracy theories and hidden messages in popular culture and uninterested in paying his overdue rent. The public is warned to "Beware the Dog Killer" who is murdering pets. Sam meets his new neighbor, Sarah, who despite having caught him spying on her, invites him over. The two get high and watch How to Marry a Millionaire, but when her roommates interrupt as they begin to kiss, Sarah suggests Sam leave and they hang out the next day.<br><br>
In the morning, Sam discovers Sarah and her roommates have moved out overnight, and becomes obsessed with learning what happened. Noticing a strange symbol painted on the apartment's wall, Sam trails a woman from the apartment to a series of elite Hollywood parties, encountering the pop band "Jesus and the Brides of Dracula" and a performance artist working for a prostitution ring of struggling actresses. All seem connected, but Sam struggles to find any meaningful pattern.</div></blockquote>

Watch the trailer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwgUesU1pz4" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwgUesU1pz4</a> It mentions secret groups.</div>

After Yale, Mr. Gerson joined the Justice Department in Washington as a trial lawyer in the newly created Office of Special Investigations. His job was to track down Nazi collaborators — concentration camp guards, chiefs of auxiliary police and active fascist sympathizers — who had succeeded in acquiring visas to the United States after the war by misrepresenting their roles in the Holocaust. Before it was disbanded in 2010, the office won rulings against more than 100 collaborators, many of whom were deported or extradited.</div></blockquote>

Where he found his peace?  In Chilmark on Martha's Vineyard:<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Allan Gerson, a self-described dreamer whose family fled Nazi-occupied Poland under a false name and who became a prominent international lawyer representing victims of human rights abuses and terrorist attacks, died Dec. 1 at his home in Washington. He was 74.<br><br>
The cause was complications of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a degenerative brain disorder, said his wife, cookbook author Joan Nathan.<br><br>
A man of many passions, he was also fine art photographer whose works are displayed in various museums and inspired a line of jewelry he designed by transferring photographic images onto gold and silver.<br><br>
Mr. Gerson found solace in the quiet beauty of Chilmark, where he and Ms. Nathan built a home nearly two decades ago and where he enjoyed summer vacations with friends and family.<br><br>
“He especially loved having breakfast alone at the Beach Plum Inn alone overlooking the water, and enjoying the finer things in life at Lennox and Harvey and stores with purpose and intention and design,” said his daughter Merissa.</div></blockquote>

Another quote:<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>As a young lawyer, he worked for the Justice Department, pursuing Nazi war criminals who had fled to the United States, and later served as senior counsel to two U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and Vernon A. Walters, before entering private practice.<br><br>
In addition to his wife and daughter Merissa, he leaves two other children, Daniela Gerson and David Henry Gerson, both of Los Angeles; a brother, Sam; and two grandchildren.<br><br>
A graveside service was held Dec. 5 at the Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Cemetery in Vineyard Haven.</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">Interesting music video recorded at the location of a suspect pedo-network operator, James Alefantis, published April 2016, some time before people started to suspect something:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-qaqce9pbE" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-qaqce9pbE</a><br><br>
A slightly strange text in the context of later findings:<br><br><a href="https://thegreya.bandcamp.com/track/unusual-as-usual" class="postlink">https://thegreya.bandcamp.com/track/unusual-as-usual</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Didn’t you know they'll lie right to you<br><br>

At 2:36 you can see the symbolism of the left hand, which represents the path of the left hand in the occult:<br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/975139154641965156/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br><br>
The symbolism of the left hand was promoted by occult films produced by James Alefantis, Matthew Lessner and David Gerson (together with James they know Nora Maccoby, who has been in a close relationship with Anneke Lucas, the person who claims to be a victim of "satanic ritual" abuse ")<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I know Im late with this one but Lessner site promoting Automatic at Sea and Chapel Perilous with left hand symbolism and one eye seems to be pretty telling.<br><br><a href="https://m.facebook.com/joinusinthewoods" class="postlink">https://m.facebook.com/joinusinthewoods</a><br><br><a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/716477412505944167/962792933235511366/1649361509771_20220410211404.jpg" class="postlink">https://media.discordapp.net/attachment ... 211404.jpg</a><br><br>

Going back to "Unusual As Usual", this guy wears a fez hat ... what is he even eating ?!<br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/975141002006384640/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>

According to federal prosecutors, the Jesters frequently employed strippers and prostitutes at their parties, with some of the prostitutes being illegally transported over state lines for Jesters events.[5]</div></blockquote>

In the clip "Unusual As Usual", just like in Chapel Perilous, you can feel a slight bohemia twisting in strange directions:<br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/975144271046922290/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>

You think technology can free us, please explain<br><br>
Cause no I don't think we'll be emancipated<br><br>
They'll just drop us all and then leave<br><br>
They'll just drop us all and then leave<br><br>
You know I don't think we'll be emancipated<br><br>
They'll just drop us all and then leave<br><br>
They'll just drop us all and then leave<br><br>
And we're bound by the wheels and the wires<br><br>
Until they break, let us steal and conspire<br><br>
to tear them up and down<br><br>
Until they find us<br><br>
You know I don't think we'll be emancipated<br><br>
They'll just drop us all and then leave<br><br>
They'll just fuck us all and then leave<br><br>

Here is The Grey A's response to the conspiracy accusation in the lyrics of their songs, which were supposedly meant to serve as a political manifesto.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Unusual As Usual" is a single piece of an 11 song politipop opera and album that tells the story of a country divided by partizan fights, an undemocratic election system, greed of the elitist classes in both parties, inaction on deadly climate change, and the economic strangulation of the working poor. <br><br>
But at it's heart the message of the record is one of unity of all peoples and the power of the collective heart and mind. The song My Country Song says, "We won't get the most out of life til we let go. As long as we detest and despise one human soul...look out below". The peoples unified voice is stronger than greedy elites fences and towers. While a few political differences exist among the citizenry, they are a SMALL percentage of the overall beliefs the citizen's of My Country share. The struggles and frustrations listed above are universal to people of many nations, not just my own, and if we join together there will be no stopping us from breaking free.<br><br>
"the criminals are casual, cause their behaviors everyday, so never you mind" looks at the way the wealthy class in My Country, the USA, lets bankers who rob us go free, healthcare companies who bankrupt the poor stay in business, military industrial complex and contractors who piss 125 billion of our taxes away, and the leadership on both side of the political spectrum that smile and lie about impending danger so they can illegally invade other countries and our private lives through our own technology. <br><br>
I accept all people and do not demonize those that think differently than me. That said, the lyrics to Unusual were inspired and speak strongly towards Republican leadership that stands in front of the camera's with practiced lies, that repeated, gain traction. For me it started with the middle east invasions, actions I spent years in the streets opposing. The lyric says, "think you're ever gonna beat em', you better learn to read your lines". In order to push back at practiced lies you have to have an equally practiced script and must endlessly stay on message to be heard. But don't become a practiced liar. Instead listen to truth tellers and start practicing telling truths.<br><br>
As a music activist I fight for all people and am a loud defender of the working poor and the ignored. I am also a fierce activist against rape culture and sexual violence against all people, especially against children.

Those that are overcome by their fear and run from understanding will be lost forever. Those that accuse from behind digital walls and are afraid to speak face to face to their "enemy" will forever be lost. I will not make you my enemy and instead extend my hand of friendship and understanding to you. Listen to the music for more knowledge and know that there is love and kindness for you if you desire it. Don't be afraid to accept it. You deserve to be loved. <br><br>
UNITE BEHIND TRUTH AND BE FREE<br><br>
RUN FROM THE DARKNESS OF FEAR AND IGNORANCE </div></blockquote>

There's a bit of symbolism on their homepage and FB.<br><br><a href="http://thegreya.com/" class="postlink">http://thegreya.com/</a><br><br><a href="http://thegreya.com/stuff/grey-a-my-country-tshirt" class="postlink">http://thegreya.com/stuff/grey-a-my-country-tshirt</a><br><br><a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52169c35e4b0ccd55f4dfd46/1407284154972-5O5V5IMJI9GK9UQMSKVU/GreyA-Shirt-Black.jpg" class="postlink">https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/cont ... -Black.jpg</a><br><br>
However, they were used to such symbolism prior to the scandal, so it doesn't seem like a provocation given the Fraternal/freemasonic reference in their music clip:<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGreyAmusic/photos/a.247584805427698/464590070393836/" class="postlink">https://www.facebook.com/TheGreyAmusic/ ... 070393836/</a><br><br><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/975150078320869436/unknown.png" class="postlink">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png</a><br><br>

Everything matches. The film was shot on the Marthas Vineyard where Epstein flew and was introduced by Lynn Rothschild to Dershowitz, who also lives there.<br><br>

‘ALL MEN ARE EVIL’<br><br>
The wife of celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz has blamed the #MeToo movement for allegations against her husband. Speaking to New York Magazine’s Intelligencer, <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Carolyn Cohen lamented that her husband is the victim</span></strong> of man hating and claims by another celebrity lawyer David Boies that her husband had sex with one of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims while he defended the financier are pure fantasy. “My hope, my greatest dream, would be for this to be revealed as really a sinister plot by Boies, and that he gets what’s due to him, and Alan gets totally exonerated,” Cohen told the Intelligencer. “And the #MeToo movement pulls back some and becomes a more reasonable, due process-oriented, valuable movement. This alerts us to the dangers of being too fanatical.” She added that she believed that the balance of presumption had tilted too far. “It’s like, all men are evil.”</div></blockquote>

Remember that left hand path symbolism was used by Lessner/Gerson/Alefantis movies:<br><br><a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?p=23467#p23467" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=23467#p23467</a><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I know Im late with this one but Lessner site promoting Automatic at Sea and Chapel Perilous with left hand symbolism and one eye seems to be pretty telling.<br><br><a href="https://m.facebook.com/joinusinthewoods" class="postlink">https://m.facebook.com/joinusinthewoods</a><br><br><a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/716477412505944167/962792933235511366/1649361509771_20220410211404.jpg" class="postlink">https://media.discordapp.net/attachment ... 211404.jpg</a><br><br>
