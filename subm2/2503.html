There was a sports shop we always used to go into, and there was a McDonald's." Like Easterbrook, McDonald's UK was then a comparative fledgling, just four years old. "We used to go off with three or four quid in our pocket. That would cover our train fare, mooching around Harrow, and going to McDonald's. It was the first time I had shakes and fries."<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Berlin Packaging is a supplier of packaging services based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Its customers include companies in the beverage, food, personal care, pharmaceutical, household care, industrial, and coatings sectors.

<br>
At the end of 2017, the firm had 30 sales offices as well as more than 75 dedicated or third-party warehouse locations across the United States and Canada. Through its European operations with Bruni Glass and Bruni Erben, Berlin Packaging also has sales and warehouse locations in Italy, France, Spain, England, and South Africa..<br>
<br>
Berlin Packaging was formed in 1988[3] when<span style="color:#FF0040"> lawyer Andrew T. Berlin joined his father in purchasing Alco Packaging</span>, a longtime Chicago-based container company, which was renamed Berlin Packaging. Alco Packaging earned $69 million in annual sales at the time, and its roots trace back to 1898, when Riekes Container was founded, a firm purchased by Alco Packaging in 1975.<br>
<br>
Acquisitions<br>
In 2000, Berlin Packaging acquired Knap-Pac Containers,[4] a wholesale provider of industrial and personal care packaging.<br>
<br>
In 2003, it purchased Freund Container,[5] a packaging, closure and industrial-supplies distributor, maintaining it as an operating division.<br>
<br>
In 2010, the firm acquired two companies: All-Pak Inc.[6] of Bridgeville, Pennsylvania, a supplier of rigid packaging products and services, and Continental Packaging Solutions,[7] a multinational supplier of glass and plastic containers and closures headquartered in Chicago. Both companies were merged into Berlin Packaging's larger packaging business.</div></blockquote>

According to Variety, the party guests included many well known names in the music biz.  The party was held at the fancy shmancy Madison Club in La Quinta, a resort city near Indio, California where Coachella is held. Bold face names on the property include Karsdashians and Jenners, Rande Gerber and Cindy Crawford, Sly Stallone, Scooter Braun, Ray Romano and Alan Smolinsky, one of the owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A number of points from that WaPo article on the Finders cult. I'm going to look at the journalists who wrote that piece in 1987 - Saundra Saperstein and Victoria Churchville ..She attended MIT.. The Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT seeks to advance science journalism in the public interest .. Launched in 1983 under the guidance of founding director, Victor McElheny..The KSJ vision was recognized early as an essential one in supporting and developing science journalism by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation — the program’s primary funder — as well as the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, and the Kavli Foundation.<br>
<br>
In 1978, McElheny left The New York Times after five years as the paper’s technology specialist to join <span style="color:#FF0040">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</span> as first director of the Banbury Center. He was charged with organizing approximately 20 conferences on environmental health risks, and publishing (as the chief editor) 12 books from the conferences. He worked under Watson’s supervision for four years. In subsequent years, McElheny has visited Cold Spring Harbor many times, particularly to do research for his 2003 biography Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution and also to gather material for his 2010 history of the Human Genome Project for Basic Books..</div></blockquote></div>
