Delos pioneered the <span style="color:#FF0040">WELL Building Standard™</span>, now the global benchmark used to promote health and well-being in buildings everywhere. The standard is managed and delivered by our subsidiary, the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI), a public-benefit corporation.<br>

Alongside experts at the Mayo Clinic, Delos built the <span style="color:#FF0040">Well Living Lab™</span>, the first research space exclusively committed to studying the impact of indoor environments on human health. <em class="text-italics">Delos Wellness Intelligence</em> sits at the intersection of the building and health sciences.

We'll get to the occult meaning of WELL later...probably on another post..<br>

It seems that while we all were on lockdown the hotel industry used the opportunity to 'upgrade' their rooms...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The concept of sustainability in the hotel industry during the past 30 years has progressed from programs designed to merely reuse towels to ones looking to ditch plastic bottles and reduce food waste. But the idea of sustainability in the hotel space is about more than just the environment, energy, and water efficiency, according to the Urban Land Institute’s Sustainability in Hotels report. Properties that implement desirable health and wellness features will likely end up “personalizing the guest experience” and thereby “strengthening the overall value proposition and brand loyalty.”<br>
<br>
But how do hotels measure their wellness value proposition? That’s where the WELL Building Standard comes in. It’s a performance-based system that measures, monitors, and certifies features of buildings that impact the well-being of the people who visit them. And if enough hotels buy in, the certification could change the wellness travel landscape in the years ahead...

</div></blockquote>

This is a complex tale and I'm trying to work out how to approach it.. so this may become rambling .. but that triad of Delos, Cleveland Clinc and Chopra is very significant....<br>
<br>
The Cleveland Clinic has been written about in a number of pizzagate posts and is also significant for the UK because in 2016 the Cleveland Clinic quietly moved into 33 Grosvenor Place, London.. practically opposite to Buckingham Palace.  This was previously the offices of Mirabaud Securities who moved out to make way for them. In 2015, Mirabaud had employed Will Draper, the alleged financier of Hampstead cult, a little while after the Hampstead case broke. He subsequently moved on to BT. See: <span style="color:#00FF40">BT, the Red Cross, the Clinton Foundation and Will Draper. Yup, it's another US/UK connection for the Hampstead case.. the UK pizzagate</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2371562/11799932" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2371562/11799932</a><br>
<br>
and in the post: <span style="color:#00FF40">Moving company Momentous Relocation of the Hampstead case changed its name from Baxter International after a court case with the Ministry of Defence. Some coincidences..</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3159829" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3159829</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Robert Hannigan, head of the GCHQ intelligence agency, stepped down in 2017 after the National Crime Agency discovered he helped a gay pedophile family friend with an interest in baby rape images avoid a custodial sentence four years earlier. British Prime Minister Theresa May is being accused of covering up the scandal..<br>
<br>
He was approved to work with business consultancy McKinsey, Hiscox Insurance, Immersive Labs and Blueteam-Global...BlueteamGlobal, a new firm founded by executives with ties to Morgan Stanley, said on Thursday that it has raised more than $125 million and plans to offer managed security services and cyber threat intelligence... the firm’s cofounders are former Jim Rosenthal, who is its chief executive; and <span style="color:#FF0040">Tom Glocer</span>, former CEO of Thomson Reuters and a member of Morgan Stanley’s board, who is BlueteamGlobal’s executive chairman. ... Glocer also serves on the Boards of Merck &amp; Co., Publicis Groupe and K2 Intelligence; <span style="color:#FF0040">he is a trustee of the Cleveland Clinic</span> and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. </div></blockquote>

So, it was clear to me that the NHS was in trouble as it was already chronically underfunded at the time and now an American private healthcare firm Like Cleveland was quietly setting up in London.. the activist nurse in the following video says the same thing as she tries to warn people about the increasing use of AI and Bill Gates' funded technology and the role of the COVID 'vaccine' in all of this :

<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The resort was announced by Circus Circus Enterprises on November 14, 1991.

Okay, I'm just going to stop here for now having introduced the topic.  I'll continue below by getting more into the biotechnology involved with these new SMART buildings and the potential connections with the vaccinated, as well as the business interest of the people involved on the DELOS Advisory board.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>ValuJet Airlines, later known as AirTran Airlines after merging with AirTran Airways, was an American ultra low-cost airline, headquartered in unincorporated Clayton County, Georgia,[2] that operated regularly scheduled domestic and international flights in the Eastern United States and Canada[3] during the 1990s. The company was founded in 1992 and was notorious for its sometimes dangerous cost-cutting measures. .. The company quickly developed a reputation for its relaxed safety. In 1995, the military refused ValuJet's bid to fly military personnel over safety worries, and officials at the FAA wanted the airline to be grounded.<br>
<br>
The crash of Flight 592 in 1996, which was caused by illegally stored hazardous materials on board, spelled doom for the airline. ValuJet was grounded the next month and not allowed to fly again until September of that same year, with a greatly reduced fleet. The airline's major customers never returned, and the company suffered major losses.<br>
<br>
Inception<br>
ValuJet was founded in 1992 and began operations on October 26, 1993. It originally offered service from Atlanta to Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa with a single Douglas DC-9 that previously belonged to <span style="color:#FF0040">Delta Air Lines</span>. The first flight, Flight 901, flew from Atlanta to Tampa. The carrier was headed by a group of industry veterans including co-founder and chairman Robert Priddy, who had started a string of successful airlines including Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA), Air Midwest Airlines, and Florida Gulf Airlines. Board members Maury Gallagher and <span style="color:#FF0040">Tim Flynn,</span> the other co-founders, developed and ran WestAir before selling it to Mesa Airlines; former Continental Airlines and Flying Tigers President Lewis Jordan joined the carrier a short time later as president.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Allegiant Air (usually shortened to Allegiant) is an American ultra-low cost airline that operates scheduled and charter flights. ..Founded in 1997 as WestJet Express, it is wholly owned by Allegiant Travel Company..The corporate headquarters are in Summerlin, Nevada, a suburb of Las Vegas...  The airline also has authority for charter service to Canada and Mexico<br>
<br>
..2000s<br>
Allegiant Air opened a small hub in Long Beach, California (LGB) and in 2000 was operating nonstop flights to Fresno and Las Vegas in addition to Fresno-Las Vegas nonstop service.[14] Later in 2000, Allegiant continued to expand and was operating the only nonstop jet service between Lake Tahoe Airport from Long Beach Airport in addition to operating new flights into Portland, Oregon and Reno with Portland-Reno and Reno-Fresno nonstops and direct one-stop service between Portland and Fresno via Reno...<br>
<br>
Also in 2006, the airline had a fleet of 21 MD-80s and was flying non-stop to and from 40 small cities, including Allentown, Pennsylvania, Duluth, Minnesota, and Idaho Falls, Idaho. Most of those flights went to and from the hubs of Las Vegas or Orlando Sanford International Airport, Florida.[17] In October 2007, Allegiant opened a fourth focus city and operations base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa, Arizona, connecting 13 cities already served by Allegiant and one new city to the Phoenix metropolitan area. ..<br>
<br>
In March 2011, Allegiant took over charter service to Wendover Airport for Peppermill Casinos, Inc. to shuttle customers to Peppermill's three casinos in West Wendover, Nevada; the Montego Bay Resort, the Rainbow Wendover and the Peppermill Wendover.[.. The company had charter contracts with<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> Caesars Entertainment</span></span> to ferry customers to Caesars casino properties through Reno-Tahoe International Airport, Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport and Tunica Municipal Airport.[58] These contracts ended in December 2012 when Caesars Entertainment signed a new contract with Republic Airways to provide the charter service to Caesars properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tunica, Mississippi, and Laughlin, Nevada... On August 5, 2019, Allegiant inked a 20-year deal with the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) for the naming rights to the team's new home, Allegiant Stadium, in Paradise, Nevada.[63] Allegiant is also a main sponsor with GMS Racing in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series. ..

Breakdown, renewal and transformation are buzzwords we also find in MK Ultra techniques and at this point  all this looks deliberate to me. A thought that has occured to me is that a veterans' camp of PTSD individuals seems like an ideal  environment for psychological observation and experimentation.<br>

Larry Decker works within the area of humanistic psychology.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective that rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in answer to the limitations of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner's behaviorism..In the 20th century, humanistic psychology was referred to as the "third force" in psychology, distinct from earlier, less humanistic approaches of psychoanalysis and behaviorism...<br>
<br>
Origins<br>
One of humanistic psychology's early sources was the work of Carl Rogers, who was strongly influenced by <span style="color:#FF0040">Otto Ran</span>k, who broke with Freud in the mid-1920s.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Rank" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Rank</a> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 1905, at the age of 21, Otto Rank presented Freud with a short manuscript on the artist, a study that so impressed Freud he invited Rank to become Secretary of the emerging Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Rank thus became the first paid member of the psychoanalytic movement, and Freud's "right-hand man" for almost 20 years. ..<br>
<br>
Rank was one of Freud's six collaborators brought together in a secret "committee" or "ring" to defend the psychoanalytic mainstream as disputes with Alfred Adler and Carl Jung developed. Rank was the most prolific author in the "ring" besides Freud himself, extending psychoanalytic theory to the study of legend, myth, art, creativity and The Double ("Doppelgänger"). ...[After breaking with Freud] In May 1926, having made the feeling relationship in the "here-and-now" central to his practice of psychotherapy, Rank moved to Paris where he became a psychotherapist for artists such as Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin and lectured at the Sorbonne

<br>
If we didn’t know the context of the dreams, would we have been able to guess that they were dreamt during Covid-19 times?..<br>
<br>
There was a clear difference between the stream of dreams and the stream of associations about them.  While it was difficult to find a clear common/main message in the dreams – the associations were different – they had a clear common denominator.  They were quite coherent and clearly connected with the collective trauma.  They were dysphoric, depressed, guilty, talking about pollution, garbage, trees which no more exist, etc.  As if the matrix was telling us: why are you, mankind, so narcissistically injured?  Making such a fuss of your anxieties?  The Covid-19 is part of nature as also you. Go ahead. Survive. Life goes on.<br>
<br>
Humans are presented in the dream world as attacking nature, the container, but the container (nature) is attacking the Contained (humans). Hence perhaps the disconnection between dream and associations?..
</div></blockquote>

Uh huh...<br>
<br>
I bring up Tavistock because I recently watched a video about the Tavistock's influence on the mental health of British society... in this blog about 'Hoaxstead trolls' who, the blogger says, are connected to the Tavistock Institute. They were employed to 'debunk' the Hampstead case, which we have since discovered has all sorts of connections to British and American elites.  <br>

<br>
<em class="text-italics">"What was it that made the Reese method of brainwashing so successful? Basically, it was this : The same psychotherapy techniques used to cure a mentally sick individual could be applied in the opposite direction. <span style="color:#FF0040">It could also be used to make healthy people become mentally ill</span>."</em><br>

I can see these techniques being used on the public at large now. It's very evident to anyone who has even a basic training in psychological techniques or even has a modicum of common sense.  An example can be seen in the mindf**ked Prince Harry and his current associations with mental health digital start-up companies which are selling apps to the public for 'mental health'... I think working to make healthy people mentally ill, perhaps?<br>
<br>
And we remember when the 'Fabulous Four' William, Kate, Meghan and Harry promoted such mental health charities as <em class="text-italics">Heads Together</em> to the masses.  We all know where all of this is going, right?</div>
