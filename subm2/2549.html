<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Luke Oliver Johnson (born 2 February 1962), is a British entrepreneur. He is a former chairman of the Pizza Express chain, the Royal Society of Arts and Channel 4. He writes a weekly column for The Sunday Times. Johnson calls himself a "projector", in line with the 17th century term for a man involved in many different businesses.[2] He is the part owner and chairman of Gail's Artisan Bakery and Feng Sushi among other businesses. He is a former owner of The Ivy, Le Caprice and J Sheekey restaurants and a former part owner of Giraffe Restaurants...<br>
<br>
Whilst at university Johnson together with fellow student Hugh Osmond (later founder of Punch Taverns) interviewed <span style="color:#FF0040">Richard Branson on his houseboat in London for the student newspaper</span>. This gave the pair the inspiration to go into business and they began running the Era nightclub in Oxford. By the time of graduation, he and Osmond were running businesses from software to clubs.<br>
<br>
He initially studied medicine but, like Hugh Osmond, only completed the first part of the course, graduating from Oxford University with a BA in Physiological Sciences in 1983. He began his career as a media analyst at stockbroker Grieveson Grant (subsequently Kleinwort Benson Securities).<br>
<br>
..Former investments<br>
In 1996 Johnson co-founded Integrated Dental Holdings, expanding it to become the UK's largest chain of dental surgeries, with over 500 dentists. The firm was sold in 2006 for over £100 million.[12] From 2004 to 2006 Johnson was director of Dollar Financial Group Inc, a US NASDAQ traded corporation with $80m EBITDA.[12] He was involved in parcel delivery and maritime commerce through <span style="color:#FF0040">Nightfreight and American Port Services</span>.<br>
<br>
He served as a non-executive director of Elderstreet VCT plc for ten years. Through Risk Capital Partners, Johnson was a founder, part-owner and director of recruitment business InterQuest Group plc. Risk Capital Partners is also a former investor in advertising and design group Loewy, which was sold in 2006, and formerly a part-owner of fresh fish distributor Seafood Holdings,[13] sold in 2010 for £45m in total. Risk also held a stake in car park technology provider APT controls until 2014.[14][15]<br>
<br>
In February 2013 Johnson became an investor and shareholder in retro confectionery retailers Hope and Greenwood,[16] later selling the intellectual property of the brand to Honeycomb Project Management when Hope and Greenwood entered into administration in 2015.</div></blockquote>

Phew.. did you get all those businesses? And there are even more.. but for now, let's stick with American Port Services...<br>

<br>
Sometimes called a "playboy millionaire", he began investing in public and private companies in 1989 after several years working as a stockbroking analyst at Kleinwort Benson. Successes to date include Topps Tiles, the UK's leading tile retailer (the shares have risen from 50p to over 250p since the company went public three years ago) and <span style="color:#FF0040">American Port Services. The London-listed group was sold for £100m to Associated British Ports in June 1998</span>, showing a return of more than 250% on its 1995 issue price.</div></blockquote>

Associated British Ports Holdings Plc History <a href="http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/associated-british-ports-holdings-plc-history/" class="postlink">http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company- ... c-history/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Associated British Ports Holdings Plc (ABPH) is the largest operator of seaports in the United Kingdom. The company also owns docks in the United States and provides port-related services, such as stevedoring and distribution. Created from the privatization of the former British Transport Docks Board in 1983, the company's core Associated British Ports subsidiary owns 23 ports covering much of the English and Welsh coastlines, including some of the country's most important ports, such as Southampton, Swansea, Grimsby, Cardiff, and Hull. Other docks held by the company include Barry, Ayr, Barrow, Immingham, Newport, Plymouth, Colchester, Talbot, and Whitby. Altogether, ABP's ports process more than 127 million tons of cargo per year. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The company's purchase of American Port Services (Amports), a British-owned but U.S.-based business, gave it seaport operations in <span style="text-decoration:underline">California, Delaware, Georgia, and Florida.</span></span> ABPH also runs a property investment and development arm, Grosvenor Waterside Group, which focuses on redevelopment efforts of the company's unused port-side properties. Other companies under the ABPH umbrella include Northern Cargo Services, a stevedoring company operating in the Port of Hull, which was acquired in 2000; Exxtor Shipping Services, acquired in 1998, based in Immingham; and Amports UK, formed from the 2000 acquisition of the Berkeley Group. ABPH also owns shares in joint ventures, including Southampton Container Terminals (49 percent) with P&amp;O Ports; and Tilbury Container Services, jointly owned by ABP, P&amp;O Ports, and Forth Ports. The company, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, is led by CEO Bo Lerenius. ABPH has been restructuring in order to focus on its core ports and port services operations. This has led to the sell-off of a number of operations in 2000 and 2001, including its Red Funnel ferry service and the aviation management division of Amports, as well as plans to sell off a large part of its £650 million property portfolio. </div></blockquote>

Johnson was educated at the <span style="color:#FF0040">Jesuit independent school Stonyhurst College</span>, and at Magdalen College, Oxford. He first came to prominence in the 1950s as a journalist writing for and later editing the New Statesman magazine. A prolific writer, Johnson has written over 40 books and contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers. His sons include the journalist Daniel Johnson, founder of Standpoint magazine, and the businessman Luke Johnson, former chairman of Channel 4.<br>
<br>
Johnson was born in Manchester. His father, William Aloysius Johnson, was an artist and Principal of the Art School in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. <span style="color:#FFFF40">At Stonyhurst College, Johnson received an education grounded in the Jesuit method,[1] which he preferred over the more secularized curriculum of Oxford.</span> Whilst at Oxford, Johnson was tutored by the historian A. J. P. Taylor[2] and was a member of the exclusive Stubbs Society.<br>
<br>
..Johnson was successively lead writer, deputy editor and editor of the New Statesman magazine from 1965 to 1970. He was found suspect for his attendances at the soirées of <span style="color:#FFFF40">Lady Antonia Fraser</span>, then married to a Conservative MP. There was some resistance to his appointment as New Statesman editor, not least from the writer Leonard Woolf, who objected to a Catholic filling the position, and Johnson was placed on six months' probation.<br>
<br>
..Johnson is a critic of modernity because of what he sees as its moral relativism,[14] and finds objectionable those who use Charles Darwin's theory of evolution to justify their atheism or use it to promote biotechnological experimentation.[15] As a result, Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker have been a target of Johnson's criticism.[16][17] As a conservative Catholic, Johnson regards liberation theology as a heresy and defends clerical celibacy, but departs from others in seeing many good reasons for ordination of women as priests...Admired by conservatives in the United States and elsewhere, he is strongly anticommunist.[19] Johnson has defended Richard Nixon[20] in the Watergate scandal, finding his cover-up considerably less heinous than Bill Clinton's perjury and Oliver North's involvement in the Iran-Contra Affair. In his Spectator column, Johnson defended his friend Jonathan Aitken,[21] has expressed admiration for General Augusto Pinochet[22] and limited admiration for General Franco<br>
<br>
..Johnson is a Eurosceptic who played a prominent role in the 'No' campaign during the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EC. In 2010 Johnson noted that 'you can't have a common currency without a common financial policy, and you can't have that without a common government. The three things are interconnected. So this [European integration] was entirely foreseeable. Not much careful thought and judgment goes into the EU. It's entirely run by bureaucrats.'[27]<br>
<br>
He served on the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Royal Commission on the Press (1974–77) </span>and was a member of the Cable Authority (regulator) from 1984 to 1990.<br>
<br>
Paul Johnson has been married since 1958 to the psychotherapist and former Labour Party parliamentary candidate Marigold Hunt, daughter of Dr. Thomas Hunt, physician to Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee, and Anthony Eden...They have three sons and a daughter: the journalist Daniel Johnson,[28] a freelance writer, editor of Standpoint magazine, and previously associate editor of The Daily Telegraph; Luke Johnson,[28] businessman and former chairman of Channel 4 Television; Sophie Johnson-Clark, an independent television executive; and Cosmo Johnson, playwright. Paul and Marigold Johnson have ten grandchildren. Marigold Johnson's sister, Sarah, an art historian, married the journalist, former diplomat and politician George Walden; <span style="color:#FF0040">their daughter, Celia Walden, is the wife of television presenter and former newspaper editor <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Piers Morgan</span></span><br>
<br>
Johnson is a friend of British playwright <span style="color:#FF0040">Tom Stoppard</span>, who dedicated his 1978 play Night and Day to him.<br>
<br>
In 1998 it was revealed Johnson had an affair lasting eleven years with the writer Gloria Stewart.[29] <span style="color:#FF0040">Stewart went public with the affair to the newspapers after what she saw as Johnson's hypocrisy over his views on morality, religion and family values.</span></div></blockquote>

Yeah, I think hypocrisy is a gene that runs in that family.. or maybe a better word would be deception.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Luke Johnson, chairman at Belgo Group, has bought 11 million shares in the chain of Belgian-style restaurants at 3p each.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgo" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgo</a> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Belgo is a small chain of London restaurants specializing in simple Belgian cooking and Belgian beer.<br>
<br>
There were four Belgo restaurants: Belgo Centraal (Covent Garden), Belgo Holborn, Belgo Kings Cross and Belgo Nottingham;[1] following closures announced in July 2020, only Belgo Kings Cross remains in business.<br>
<br>
Johnson sold his interest in Belgo in 2005 to Tragus Group, now Casual Dining Group, which also owns the French-styled Café Rouge chain and the Bella Italia chain of Italian restaurants.<br>
<br>
In July 2020 on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Causal Dining Group went into administration and it announced that Belgo would permanently close three of its four sites..<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">In 2013, Belgo was an official partner of Comic Relief</span>, the British charity founded in 1985 that <span style="color:#FFFF40">aims to "bring about positive and lasting change in the lives of poor and disadvantaged people".</span>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Casual Dining Group (CDG), formerly Tragus Group, operated 250 restaurants in the United Kingdom. CDG operated restaurants primarily under the Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas names. It also operates sites under the Belgo, Huxleys, Oriel Grande Brasserie and La Salle brands. The company was backed by investors including <span style="color:#FF0040">KKR </span>and Pemberton Capital Advisors...<br>
<br>
Tragus Holdings was formed in 2002[3][4] when Whitbread sold-off 153 failing restaurants from its Pelican and BrightReasons divisions, shortly after writing their value down by £147m.[5] At the time, the two restaurant divisions comprised the Café Rouge, Bella Pasta, Mamma Amalfi, Abbaye, Leadenhall Wine Bar and Oriel brands.<br>
<br>
A £25m[6] management buy-in by Tragus Holdings was funded by £11m from venture capitalist speculators ECI Partners.[7] Tragus Holdings was led by chief executive Finlay Scott, formerly head of the Aroma Café chain and <span style="color:#FFFF40">Whitecross Dental Care</span>. The team included Gavin Williams, managing director of Bella Pasta, and Harry Morley, former finance director of Whitecross Dental Care.<br>
<br>
In January 2005, Tragus' directors sold the company to Legal &amp; General Ventures for £90m-£95m.[8][9] The sale made them around £18m profit. The chairman, discredited former LSE CEO Gavin Casey, received £2m.[5] Legal &amp; General Ventures installed a new management team which included appointing new chief executive Graham Turner (formerly managing director of the Unique Pub Company).[10]<br>
<br>
In December 2006, Tragus was bought by Blackstone Group for £267m. By that time, the business had grown to 163 restaurants.[11] In September 2006 it had also announced plans for a new restaurant concept - Huxley's Bar &amp; Kitchen – to open in the new Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 in March 2008.[12]<br>
<br>
The group expanded rapidly in 2007 with the purchase of Ma Potters restaurant company in February for £14.15m,[13] and the Strada chain - which included five Belgo and Bierodrome restaurants - in May for £140m.[14] In July, Tragus signed a deal with Center Parcs to operate several Bella Italia and Café Rouge restaurants in the leisure village operator's UK sites.[15]<br>
<br>
In April 2012 it was announced that Graham Turner would step down as Tragus chief executive. John Derkach, formerly managing director of the Costa Coffee chain took up the position in August 2012.[16]<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">In early 2014, Blackstone's stake in Tragus was acquired by US investor Apollo Global Management</span>,[17] and, in June 2014, Apollo sought to shed or restructure some of Tragus Group's rent obligations at Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia, and to sell its Strada chain.[18] In September 2014, Tragus sold Strada to Sun Capital Partners....</div></blockquote>

2014 was a vey busy year in Hampstead, I mean London.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..Casual Dining Group<br>
<br>
in March 2015, Tragus Holdings rebranded as Casual Dining Group (CDG).[20] In July 2015, CDG acquired Las Iguanas[21] and later went on to purchase La Tasca.[22][23] CDG also opened concessions including Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas restaurants at Centre Parcs villages,[24] and in UK airports, including Gatwick, Heathrow, Jersey, and Inverness..<br>
<br>
However, efforts to close loss-making outlets and stem group losses continued through to 2018.[26][27] Also in 2018, Apollo sold its stake in the group to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Pemberton Capital Advisors (the two had provided loan finance since 2015).[28] Some La Tasca restaurants were converted to other brands, and the remaining four La Tasca restaurants were sold in February 2020.<br>
<br>
...On 3 August 2020, it was announced that Casual Dining Group, including the Las Iguanas, Bella Italia and Café Rouge restaurants, had been acquired out of administration by private equity firm Epiris and rebranded as The Big Table, led by the existing management team under CEO James Spragg<br>
<br>
Brands<br>
<br>
CDG operates restaurants under the Bella Italia (100+ restaurants in the UK),[35] Café Rouge (60+)[36] and Las Iguanas names. It also operates sites under the Belgo (4, London and Nottingham), Huxleys (1, airport),[37] Oriel Grande Brasserie (3, airports), DUBL (1, airport) and La Salle brands...CDG claimed to emphasise corporate social responsibility practices.[38] It reduced its energy consumption by 17% from 2012 to 2016,[39] and <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">had a partnership with The Prince's Trust charity</span></span>.<br>
<br>
..In 2009 Tragus was the subject of newspaper reports highlighting the practice of several UK restaurant chains using customer tips to meet minimum wage laws for waiters/waitresses. The company's business model was said to depend on paying servers as little as £2.50 an hour, with the rest coming as tips</div></blockquote>

Since the 2007 liquidation of its textile manufacturing division, it has been operated out of Belgium and Kinshasa as part of a larger Belgian-headquartered Congolese textile and industrial firm under the name TEXAF. Under a series of brands, TEXAF operates in the sectors of textile design/distribution, transport, housing and construction, mechanical, and cotton plantation. UTEX operates quarrying under the name CARRIGRES, machine and rail transport fabrication under the name MECLCO, consumer textile sales branded as UTEXAFRICA, and a medical hospital, <span style="color:#FF0040">the Hospital Center UTEXAFRICA in Kinshasa.[2][3] All its arms operate in the DRC, while the company is based in Brussels.</span><br>

In the 1930s—1950s the original TEXAF concession sold off its cotton plantation and shipping elements and focused on its textile production division, under the name UTEXLEO (founded 1934).[4] Its name stood for Usines Textiles du Leopoldville, from the colonial name for Kinshasa. In 1960 it was the 31st most capitalized Conogolese company, though it remained European owned.[4] <span style="color:#FF0040">Following independence, President Mobutu's "Zaireization" campaign saw the company nationalized in 1974</span>, and renamed to reflect the new names of the country and its capital: UTEXCO.[4] In the late 1970s and 1980s, the holding company of these brands—TEXAF—consolidated much of the Zaire textile industry, with the acquisitions of SOLBENA, Zaïreprint (printing), Otricot-Super Star (food), ESTAGRICO (cotton), MECELCO (construction) COTONNIERE DU KASAI-MANIEMA, and the reacquisition of the resources of its cotton farming company (sold off in 1934) ONAFITEX.[4] From 1980, a series of European companies held majority stock in TEXAF..</div></blockquote>

which was established in 2007. <br>
<br>
..The Social Exclusion Task<br>
Force, which replaced the Social Exclusion Unit in June 2006, aimed to identify those most<br>
at risk, and focused on “excluded” groups. In 2006 the Cabinet Office published the Social<br>
Exclusion Task Force’s report Reaching out: an action plan on social exclusion, which<br>
highlighted the importance of parenting as a factor in improving outcomes for children. The<br>
plan announced ten health-led parenting support demonstration projects for 0-2 year olds,<br>
based on the <span style="color:#FF0040">Nurse-Family Partnership programme run by Olds in the US (Olds, Sadler and<br>
Kitzman, 2007)</span>..<br>
<br>
..The Parents, Early Years and Learning Project (PEAL) was commissioned by the DfES<br>
2005-07 ‘with the task of gathering and assessing existing knowledge and best practice in<br>
working with parents to involve them in their young children’s learning’. The consortium of<br>
organisations included the National Children’s Bureau, Coram, <span style="color:#FF0040">the Thomas Coram<br>
Children’s Centre</span> and the London Borough of Camden..

The David Olds Story <a href="https://www.nursefamilypartnership.org/about/program-history/" class="postlink">https://www.nursefamilypartnership.org/ ... m-history/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Even as a child, David Olds knew he wanted to help people. But it wasn’t until after he graduated from Johns-Hopkins University and was working at an inner-city day care center that he figured out how he could do that effectively.<br>
<br>
At that day care center, Olds cared for preschoolers damaged by abuse, and suffering the effects of their parents’ struggles. He wanted to help those children, but realized the best chance for giving them a better start in life was to provide that help much earlier, when they were infants – or even before they were born.<br>
<br>
That realization led Olds to create a program that created supportive relationships between trained nurses and first-time, at-risk moms. Over the next 35 years, Olds tested the program, first in Elmira, New York, then Memphis, Tennessee, and then Denver, Colorado.<br>
<br>
...By 1996, Olds was satisfied NFP was ready to be re-created and implemented in other communities. That same year, the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, funded NFP programs in six locations.<br>
<br>
Since then, the program has grown, thanks to combinations of public and private funding. Today, Nurse-Family Partnership serves low-income, first-time moms and their babies in 40 states, <span style="color:#FFFF40">the U.S. Virgin Islands</span> and many Tribal communities.<br>
<br>
..But David Olds has not stopped trying to help kids, families, and communities. He and his team at the Prevention Research Center for Family and Child Health at the University of Colorado Denver continue to study the long-term effects working with trained nurses has on children and their mothers. And they continue studying ways to make the Nurse-Family Partnership even better.

Found an unexpected connection to Bernie Madoff in the German wikipedia: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_L._Madoff" class="postlink">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_L._Madoff</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The married couple Ruth and Bernard Madoff acted as donors to numerous charitable and cultural institutions and were members of the boards of many theaters, foundations and colleges. Because of this philanthropic appearance, several charitable foundations decided to entrust Madoff with their money, which ultimately resulted in high financial damage to them...<br>
<br>
The Manhattan-based Fairfield Greenwich Group worked in turn with Jeffrey Tucker, a former employee of the Securities and Exchange Commission , and Andrés Piedrahita, the husband of Corina Noel, one of Walter Noel's five daughters and his Swiss-Brazilian wife Monica. In Italy, Lisina Noel's husband, Yanko Della Schiava, recruited Alix Noel's husband, Philip Toub , in Lausanne, Switzerland .<br>
<br>
Other "feeders", such as J. Ezra Merkin and his Ascot Partners fund or Gerald Breslauer from Los Angeles , who invested for <span style="color:#FF0040">Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg</span> , received 1.5 percent of the investment sums. ..The Brazilian <span style="color:#FF0040">Banco Safra</span> from São Paulo ran a fund called Zeus Partners Limited , which was part of Madoff's feeder system, for several years ..<br>
<br>
Another foundation, founded in 2007, had to be closed around the turn of the year from 2008 to 2009, the Fair Food Foundation of Ann Arbor . Their activities were based on the deposits of an unknown, wealthy person with Madoff. She had inter alia target the food supply of impoverished areas in Detroit . [158]<br>
<br>
There were also renowned research institutes such as t<span style="color:#FF0040">he Feinberg School of Medicine and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</span> Some of their main sponsors, such as the couple <span style="color:#FF0040">Barbara and Jeffrey Picower</span>, who had entrusted Madoff with their money, now fell out as donors. For example, her foundation, the <span style="color:#FF0040">Picower Foundation , supported a facility called the Nurse-Family Partnership in Denver</span> , whose nurses visit poor people who have no health insurance. </div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I guessed before I met him that he was an Etonian. But while he’s sporting a pink shirt suggestive of time spent on those hallowed fields, he lacks the swagger that school sometimes imparts. And Byng has restaurant pedigree too. Post-graduation, he spent two years in an advertising agency but left to set up Zucca in Notting Hill, with help from friends and family. He later took over 192 on Kensington Park Road too...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Zucca became known as the “office canteen” of the Notting Hill set (David Cameron reportedly plotted his leadership bid there)</span> but the area’s rise was to be the restaurant’s downfall: “I had nine years learning how to do it, then I gave up those businesses. I didn’t make a huge success of them financially — [with Zucca] the rent trebled at my 10-year review. Notting Hill had changed — it had become a retail mecca with retail rents to boot.”</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">The story of NHS Nightingale: how Britain’s biggest hospital was built from scratch in under two weeks <a href="https://archive.is/66vlP#selection-65.1-65.104" class="postlink">https://archive.is/66vlP#selection-65.1-65.104</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In just 10 days, military personnel, the NHS and contractors turned a London exhibition centre into the UK's largest hospital. Here's how ..<br>
<br>
You could certainly have been forgiven for thinking you’d misread your calendar when images of NHS Nightingale, the emergency field hospital built within London’s ExCel Centre to ease pressure on the health service during the coronavirus crisis, were released earlier this week...<br>
<br>
The government press conference at which Matt Hancock, the health secretary, announced NHS Nightingale’s planned construction was on March 24th. Ten days ago. At that point the ExCel was an empty, 100,000 square metre convention hall. Today, as <span style="color:#FF0040">Prince Charles cuts its virtual red tape, Nightingale is a fully functioning</span>, fully equipped field hospital capable of holding 500 Covid-19 patients. Soon, that number could expand to 4,000.<br>
<br>
It is a remarkable feat of planning and execution. Modern Britain doesn’t enjoy the finest record for delivering vast infrastructure projects on time or without drama (one thinks of Crossrail, or Wembley Stadium, <span style="color:#FFFF40">or the ExCel’s fellow eastender, the Millennium Dome</span>, among others), but the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic, combined with the fact the hospital was overseen by the Army’s top military planners in conjunction with health officials, has meant NHS Nightingale is a shining example of UK engineering at its resourceful best.<br>
<br>
The man tasked with creating a 4000-bed hospital from scratch was Colonel Ashleigh Boreham, commanding Officer, 256 City of London Field Hospital. Col Boreham, from the Army Medical Services, has spent 27 years in the Forces, including as a medical commander in Afghanistan, and has helped construct field hospitals all over the world.<br>
<br>
He was nearing the end of his time in the military when he was asked, a fortnight ago, to look into how possible it might be for the ExCel Centre to become a makeshift hospital. It would be the first of a series of field hospitals hastily built around the UK to help the ever-stretched NHS during the pandemic. The NEC Birmingham, the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, the SEC Centre in Glasgow and Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli will also turn into hospitals.<br>
<br>
...The ExCel Centre is used to rapid makeovers. It can turn from a comic convention to an industry trade show to a street food exposition in days, but those events tend to require relatively similar set ups: stages, stalls, seating, all supported by the venue’s 27 retailers and restaurants. An NHS hospital built during a pandemic is something else entirely...<br>
<br>
But hospitals are more than beds, of course. They are divided into numerous departments, starting with reception desks, triage areas, treatment sections, pharmacies, rest rooms for staff, offices for both medical leadership and building contractors and so on. NHS Nightingale required all of this, <span style="color:#FFFF40">as well as a morgue – the building of which, Col Boreham said, made “people focus their minds”.</span>...<br>
<br>
..His team was supported by troops from the Royal Anglian Regiment, many of whom had been working in Sierra Leone until recently, in addition to experts and construction units from the Royal Engineers and the Queen’s Gurkha Engineers...<br>
<br>
...<br>
NHS Nightingale is named, of course, for Florence Nightingale, in the year of her bicentenary. As the founder of modern nursing, the credentials of ‘The Lady With the Lamp’ as a hero to the health service are beyond question – but she’s particularly apt for this project.<br>
In 1854, Nightingale sent a plea to The Times newspaper deploring the conditions of British military field hospitals in Turkey during the Crimean war. Ten times more soldiers were dying from diseases like cholera and dysentery than from battle wounds. In response, the War Office commissioned Isambard Kingdom Brunel to design the world’s first prefabricated hospital in the Dardanelles. Just five months later, the entirely new Renkioi Hospital accepted its first patients (initially 300, then more than 2,000). Infection rates collapsed.<br>
Nightingale, then, is not only the mother of nursing, but possibly the mother of prefab. Now, more than 150 years on, the first patients will be arriving this week at an even more swiftly-built hospital bearing her name, as the health service faces its greatest crisis in peacetime.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>ExCeL London (an abbreviation for Exhibition Centre London)[3] is an exhibition and international convention centre in the Royal Docks area of Newham, East London.[4] Its 100-acre (0.40 km2) site is on the northern quay of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Royal Victoria Dock in London Docklands, between Canary Wharf and London City Airport. </span>..<br>
<br>
The centre was designed by Moxley Architects and built by <span style="color:#FF0040">Sir Robert McAlpine</span>. It opened in November 2000.[5][6] In May 2008 it was acquired by Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company. Phase II of development, which included building London's first International Convention Centre (ICC) and creating an "eastern arrival experience", was completed on 1 May 2010. ..<br>
<br>
The Royal Victoria Dock closed to commercial traffic in 1981, but it is still accessible to shipping. The Centre's waterfront location allows visiting vessels to moor alongside the Centre. For example, the 2005 London Boat Show was visited by HMS Sutherland. ... The DLR and a number of dual-carriageway roads connect the centre to the airport and the important nearby office-and-commercial district of Canary Wharf. Since June 2012, the Emirates Air Line cable car now links ExCeL to The O2 on the Greenwich Peninsula. <br>
<br>
Sustainability and CSR<br>
ExCeL London participates in the UN Global Compact Scheme,[16] the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative which invites companies to align with universal principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. As part of this scheme, ExCeL produces an annual communication on progress addressing the issues of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. ..</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content"><span style="color:#00FF40">Alistair McAlpine, Baron McAlpine of West Green </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_McAlpine,_Baron_McAlpine_of_West_Green" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_ ... West_Green</a><br>
<br>
Robert Alistair McAlpine, Baron McAlpine of West Green[1] (14 May 1942 – 17 January 2014) was a British businessman, politician and author who was an advisor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[2]<br>
<br>
McAlpine was descended from the McAlpine baronets who made their fortune in the construction industry. ..He went to boarding school at the age of six.[4] He suffered from dyslexia and left <span style="color:#FF0040">Stowe Schoo</span>l at 16 with three O-levels.[4][5] He then worked on a McAlpine building site on the South Bank, keeping time and dealing with wage packets...<br>
<br>
Though the inner circle of the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson had once considered appointing McAlpine as a fundraiser, McAlpine was entranced by the new Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher at a 1975 dinner party, and she soon appointed him Conservative treasurer, a position he would retain until 1990.[6] They continued to have a close working relationship throughout her time as prime minister[2] and he led the fundraising efforts for the Conservative's general election campaigns.[2] He would later describe his relationship with Thatcher in his book The Servant.[2] Using Machiavelli's The Prince for his analogy, the "Servant" (himself) is an important part of the success of the "Prince" (Thatcher).[2][6] McAlpine's obituary in The Daily Telegraph described him as "...probably the most successful fundraiser the party ever had; yet by nature a dilettante, he did not become a significant political figure" and "...never really "into" politics.<br>
<br>
McAlpine's personal political views were varied and included Euroscepticism, support for electric cars and the decriminalisation of all drugs.[3]<br>
<br>
McAlpine was nominated to the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1980, despite protests at a perceived lack of experience in the field and his opposition to public subsidisation of the arts.[7] He served on the Council from 1981 to 1982.[8] Other public bodies on which McAlpine served included the Theatre Investment Fund, of which he was chairman.[3] He was also a trustee of the Royal Opera House and a director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts.<br>
<br>
...McAlpine also channelled funds through offshore accounts, and received funds from US and Hong Kong nationals.[6] One of the funders of the era was Asil Nadir of Northern Cyprus, who was in 2012 convicted of stealing money from the Polly Peck company.[6] McAlpine said the Conservative party had a "moral duty" to return Nadir's donations, totaling £400,000, to the creditors of Polly Peck.[11] Other foreign businessmen courted by McAlpine included Li Ka-shing and Mohamed Al-Fayed.[3] McAlpine also claimed that he worked to help Major raise a large sum from Greek businessman Yiannis Latsis, though Major denied it...<br>
<br>
McAlpine was allegedly on a target list of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).[14] He was on Thatcher's team when the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984, but was not injured.[2] In 1990 the IRA bombed[15] West Green House, a mansion in Hartley Wintney,[14] where he had lived just weeks before, and where in the past Thatcher had been a guest.[14] In the mid 1980s, for reasons of safety and tax, <span style="color:#FFFF40">McAlpine decided to move to Monaco and Venice. Before his departure he had sold many of his possessions at Sotheby's.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Defamatory allegations of child abuse</span><br>
In November 2012, McAlpine was falsely implicated in the North Wales child abuse scandal, after the BBC Newsnight programme accused an unnamed "senior Conservative" of abuse.[37] McAlpine was widely rumoured on Twitter and other social media platforms to be the person in question.[37] After The Guardian reported that the accusations were the result of mistaken identity,[38] McAlpine issued a strong denial that he was in any way involved.[39] The accuser, a former care home resident, unreservedly apologised after seeing a photograph of McAlpine and realising that he had been mistaken, leading to a report in The Daily Telegraph that the BBC was "in chaos".[40] The BBC also then apologised..<br>
<br>
Another case went to court: McAlpine v Bercow. Sally Bercow, the defendant, is the wife of John Bercow, the then Speaker of the House of Commons, a high profile, politically neutral role. On 24 May 2013, the High Court of Justice ruled that her tweet, "Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*", was libellous. The two parties agreed on a settlement, and McAlpine donated the damages awarded to the charity <span style="color:#FF0040">Children in Need.</span>.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Matthew Taylor Mellon II (January 28, 1964 – April 16, 2018) was an American businessman who was a chairman of the New York Republican State Committee's finance committee...He attended The Phelps School, a boys' boarding school in Malvern, Pennsylvania, followed by college at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied management.[3][4] His father abandoned the family when he was five years old, before dying by suicide in 1983<br>
<br>
Mellon was a direct descendant of Judge Thomas Mellon,[5] founder of the Mellon Bank, now part of Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, on his paternal side. On his maternal side he was a direct descendant of Anthony Joseph Drexel,[6] a banker whose investment firm was a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert. He maintained associations with Drexel University and Carnegie Mellon University, both of which were founded by family members. He was also involved with the National Gallery of Art, the core of whose collection was donated to the nation by his great-uncle, <span style="color:#FF0040">Andrew Mellon</span>.<br>
<br>
Mellon had bipolar disorder, as did his father.[4] Prior to their 2016 divorce, Mellon lived in New York City with his wife Nicole Hanley Mellon and their two children.[10] He also had a daughter whom he raised jointly with his former wife, Tamara Mellon, the co-founder of shoe company Jimmy Choo.[11][10] Prior to his marriage to Nicole, he was engaged to entrepreneur <span style="color:#FF0040">Noelle Reno</span>, with whom he established a cashmere knitwear line...<br>
<br>
Mellon died in April 2018 in Cancun, Mexico, where he was planning to check into the Clear Sky Recovery clinic, which specializes in ibogaine therapy, a medication with psychedelic properties. However, he was reported to have died in a hotel room in Cancun before arrival at the clinic, suffering a fatal heart attack after taking ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic drink.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sir Simon Laurence Stevens (born 4 August 1966) is a British health manager and public policy analyst. Since 1 April 2014[1] he has served as the eighth Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England. He has been annually ranked the most influential person in UK health ever since[2] and described by the Health Service Journal as "the most dominant NHS figure in modern times – and arguably since Nye Bevan"<br>
<br>
Simon Stevens was born in Birmingham, England,[4] the son of a Baptist minister and a university administrator.[5] He was educated at a state comprehensive, St Bartholomew's School in Newbury, Berkshire, and won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford at Oxford University,[6] where he was elected president of the Oxford Union. His friends at Balliol reportedly ranged from Extinction Rebellion's Rupert Read[7] to Boris Johnson who credited Stevens with Johnson's own election as Oxford Union president.[8][9][10] Stevens later received an MBA from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow and was a Harkness Fellow at Columbia University, New York.<br>
<br>
His wife, Maggie, is a public health specialist from New York City..<br>
<br>
..After a spell in Congo and Malawi, he became general manager for a large NHS psychiatric hospital outside Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and ran community mental health services for North Tyneside and Northumberland. He was then appointed group manager of Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London[16] before moving to New York City Health Department...<br>
<br>
In 1997 he was appointed policy adviser to two successive Secretaries of State for Health (Frank Dobson and Alan Milburn) at the UK Department of Health. From 2001 to 2004 he was the Government's health policy adviser in the Number 10 Policy Unit to Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street. Stevens was a Labour councillor for Brixton, in the London Borough of Lambeth 1998–2002. He was closely associated with the development of the NHS Plan 2000...<br>
<br>
From 2004 to 2014 Stevens was a senior executive at UnitedHealth Group. Initially appointed president of UnitedHealth Europe, he became CEO of UnitedHealthcare's $30 billion Medicare business, and then corporate Executive Vice President and president of its global health businesses spanning the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. He also was a director of Brazil's largest hospital group AMIL..<br>
<br>
He also served on the boards of various non-profits, including the Minnesota Historical Society; the Minnesota Opera; and the Medicare Rights Center (New York), as well as the King's Fund and the Nuffield Trust...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">He has pushed the use of AI and Machine Learning in healthcare [159][160] and NHS England is hosting a new £250 million NHS AI Lab</span>.[161][162][163] Speaking at the <span style="color:#FFFF40">World Economic Forum in Davos</span> he launched the first wave of NHS Innovation Test Beds.[164][165] and introduced a new NHS innovation payment.[166] NHS England funds Academic Health Science Networks, and Stevens supported the Accelerated Access Review...<br>
<br>
..Stevens took action to stop NHS funding of homeopathy, on the grounds that it is "at best a placebo and a misuse of scarce NHS funds." NHS England was sued by the British Homeopathic Association who argued that Stevens’ criticisms, including on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, prejudged its public consultation. The High Court dismissed the BHA challenge, and backed NHS England..<br>
<br>
Stevens has drawn attention to online sources of misinformation about vaccine safety.[176] He has noted that "although nine in ten parents say they support vaccination half of them say that they have seen fake messages around vaccination on social media," and "if parents are being told that their children shouldn’t be vaccinated, it’s as irresponsible as saying 'don’t tell your children to look both ways before they cross the road on the way to school".[177][178] He called on social media sites to take action against misleading and untrue health claims.[179][180] Both Instagram[181] and Facebook[182] subsequently agreed to do so.[183] He has also spoken out against a "pandemic of disinformation" affecting uptake of covid vaccination in some communities and some countries..

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>UK Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance ex President of GSK w shares <span style="color:#FF0040">Andrew Witty ex CEO now head covid vax development WHO</span>. Pfizer merged w GSK 2019 Money bag Look at past history of fraud bribery deceit corruption child guinea pigs Ireland NY India Africa<br>
<br>
With Andrew Witty's Departure, Will GlaxoSmithKline Say Goodbye to Fraud? <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikakelton/2016/03/24/with-andrew-wittys-departure-will-glaxosmithkline-say-goodbye-to-fraud/?sh=7c4bb6f15b66" class="postlink">https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikakelto ... 4bb6f15b66</a></div></blockquote>

Corruption, bribery, illegal marketing, contaminated drugs and collusion are some of the “highlights” of Glaxo’s business practices that were revealed during Witty’s nine years at the helm.<br>
<br>
Witty oversaw Glaxo’s “Hall of Shame” when the following entries were added:<br>

    <ul><li>A $3 billion payment to the US to settle whistleblower allegations leading to civil and criminal charges that the company had marketed a number of its top-selling drugs for unapproved uses that in many cases endangered patients’ lives and health. It is the largest healthcare fraud settlement ever paid. (My firm represented the leading whistleblowers.)</li>
    </ul>
<ul><li>A $750 million payment to settle whistleblower allegations that led to civil and criminal liability for manufacturing contaminated drugs at its facility in Puerto Rico and selling them.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>A $489 million fine by a Chinese court for bribery and corruption charges based on allegations its China division paid doctors to prescribe Glaxo’s drugs. (A record penalty for China.)</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>Accusations of bribing doctors to prescribe Glaxo’s drugs in at least 11 other countries: Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Syria and United Arab Emirates.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>A fine of roughly $54.5 million by Britain’s Competition &amp; Markets Authority for allegedly paying generic drug makers illegally to delay the launch of cheaper versions of Glaxo’s Seroxat, an antidepressant.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>A fine of about $9 million imposed by India’s Competition Commission for allegedly colluding with Sanofi India in bidding to supply a meningitis vaccine to the government for Haj pilgrims.</li>
</ul>
That’s a record that won’t be missed.<br>
<br>
On the bright side, Witty’s announced resignation provides an opportunity for Glaxo to clean up its act.<br>
<br>
Glaxo reportedly is considering external as well as internal candidates for the top spot. The company should scratch internal prospects off the list.<br>
<br>
Witty came up through the ranks and landed in the CEO office after more than 20 years of slogging his way up from management trainee. Although Witty surely knows the business well, he was also part of a culture that was not healthy. Only an outsider with great resolve has a chance of reshaping the business to respect compliant and ethical practices.<br>
<br>
Given Glaxo’s recent history, the board of directors should ensure that Witty’s replacement does more than drive up profits. A dramatic cultural shift at GSK is long past due...</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Diego Della Valle (born 30 December 1953) is the chairman of the Italian leather goods company Tod's.... Even during his younger days, Diego was business savvy: Diego used the power of celebrity to popularise his product, such an example was to have once persuaded his friend <span style="color:#FFFF40">Luca di Montezemolo</span>, who was a protégé of the then <span style="color:#FF0040">Fiat boss Gianni Agnelli</span>, to present Agnelli with a pair of Tod's driving moccasins – the lawyer got Agnelli to wear Tod's shoes when attending Juventus football matches, which were widely televised; this product placement prompted a spike in sales.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Diego now manages Tod's with his brother Andrea</span>. Diego's older son, Emanuele, is also involved with the family business as the creative director. The factory in Casette d'Ete was designed by his wife, Barbara..<br>
<br>
Diego sits on the board of a number of companies, such as Ferrari, Maserati, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and LVMH.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>When it comes to wild parties, Andrew Richardson has seen it all. Since 2008, he's been Managing Director of Home House, the London private members' club which, founded in 1998, he says is "a place where people can do all things at all times" — but he says this "civilised hedonism" takes place without any trouble.<br>
<br>
The atmosphere seems to have been successful — among the 5,000 members are the likes of Paul McCartey, who "can often be seen in the gym having a workout," Madonna, and even David Hasselhoff, who Richardson said "was in the garden a couple of days ago." ..<br>
<br>
Richardson, who claims to come from humble beginnings, said he started out as a dishwasher at a local hotel when he was young and needed to earn some cash.<br>
<br>
Then he trained as a chef and embarked on a career working in hotels such as The Dorchester, The Park Lane Hotel, The Royal Berkshire Hotel in Ascot, and The Hilton in Paris.<br>
<br>
At the age of 26, he was asked to move to Hong Kong to work with a private restaurant group, where he became the managing director within 10 years. In 2002, he returned to the UK to become the manager of the Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa.<br>
<br>
At the same time, he said: "I became governor at the [culinary] college I was trained at, bought the local pub, and sponsored the local cricket team. It was all jolly lovely, but not quite what I'd anticipated."<br>
<br>
.."In my mixed portfolio, there was a property just outside of Oxford, owned by the owners of Home House," he said. "I turned around the fortunes of the property quickly, executed a clear plan and strategy, and got the attention of Home House.</div></blockquote></div>
