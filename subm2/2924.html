<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..The aim of her charitable foundation, called Sarah's Trust, is described online as a “vital bridge” between “individuals with social responsibility and the financial ability” to provide humanitarian aid for charities. ...Her Sarah Ferguson Foundation closed in 2012, but she also set up the Children In Crisis charity in 1993 which remains active...<br>
<br>
The Duchess and her daughter <span style="color:#FF0040">Princess Eugenie</span> have been helping healthcare workers during the coronavirus pandemic.</div></blockquote>

This is the logo of Sarah's Trust <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/989mat.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/989mat.jpg</a><br>

They look similar, I think.<br>

Coincidentally, Eugenie's ex-boyfriend Otto Brockway (who is a nephew of Richard Branson) is connected to the Supreme Master Ching Hai as explained in <span style="color:#00FF40">SUPREME MASTER TELEVISION LTD and the Carillion Network</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;p=10299#p10299" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;p=10299#p10299</a><br>

Under "charities we love" is KEY TO FREEDOM.. click on that link takes you to <em class="text-italics">married with baggage?</em> <a href="https://marriedwithbaggage.com/" class="postlink">https://marriedwithbaggage.com/</a>

How sloppy of Sarah's webmaster not to have picked up that the web link redirects..to an online gambling site.. at the very least .. *cough*..<br>
<br>
So, what happened to KEY TO FREEDOM?  I found some info on the Virgin Money Giving website : <a href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/charity-web/charity/displayCharityCampaignPage.action?charityCampaignUrl=keytofreedom" class="postlink">https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/charit ... ytofreedom</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Duke of York founded Key to Freedom in 2012 following his Diamond Jubilee visit to Women's Interlink Foundation (WIF) in India. WIF helps trafficked young women from West Bengal develop skills to become economically active. Key to Freedom gives WIF products a route to market thereby providing income generating opportunities for the young women. All profit from the project is paid to WIF.
</div></blockquote>

A 2019 article from The Times : Prince Andrew’s aid for abuse victims dries up <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-andrews-aid-for-abuse-victims-dries-up-b6zpts82q" class="postlink">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prin ... -b6zpts82q</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A project set up by the Duke of York to help sex trafficking victims has made no direct donations for two years.<br>
<br>
Key to Freedom is listed on Prince Andrew’s website as a personal initiative to help trafficked women by selling handmade scarves and clothing. The project’s website names Topshop and the Royal Collection gift shops but both said they no longer stocked Key to Freedom products.<br>
<br>
One campaigner who held meetings with the duke’s team about the campaign said that it felt like “reputation laundering”. He added: “A lot of people get involved with these campaigns because there’s a nice social event and they get to visit a palace.”
</div></blockquote>

More about that here:<br>
<br>
Has Prince Andrew been rescuing young girls from sex trafficking all along? No. <a href="https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/has-prince-andrew-been-rescuing-young-girls-sex-trafficking-all-along-no" class="postlink">https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article ... l-along-no</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...Another charity initiative set up by the prince to help young women trafficked for sex in India has been embroiled in allegations of mistreatment. <span style="color:#FF0040">Andrew started “Key to Freedom” in May 2012, soon after he was pictured walking with Epstein in Central Park</span>, New York, following the paedophile billionaire’s release from prison.<br>
<br>
He claimed his new charity would financially empower vulnerable young women in India by selling their handmade fashion items in Britain through retailers including Topshop and the Buckingham Palace website. However, the initiative soon fell into financial decline and is now largely inactive, despite being highlighted by the prince and his family as a success story throughout the scandal of his association with Epstein.<br>
<br>
In fact exactly when the prince’s team was setting up the Key to Freedom project, its partner charity in India, the Women’s Interlink Foundation (WIF), which manages care homes for vulnerable children and young women, was being investigated by the Indian authorities. Ten girls aged between 12 and 15 had run away from one of the WIF’s two homes for trafficked and orphaned girls alleging that they were beaten by staff and generally mistreated.<br>
<br>
WIF admits it did not tell the prince about the investigation, which it says cleared the care home. But it refused to publish the official police report or its own internal report. <br>
<br>
Clearly Prince Andrew and his team failed to conduct due diligence on his partner charity – as indeed they did with Key to Freedom that also faces criticism that it gave false hope of financial security to the women making the hand-printed silk scarves, which were sold online at the Royal Collection shop.<br>
<br>
The duke’s website also claims the initiative has “changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women” and is still active. But WIF confirms no scarves have been available to buy through retailers for more than 18 months and only tiny orders for tote bags were placed.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">These tote bags were given as gifts to guests at Andrew’s daughter Princess Eugenie’s wedding last year</span>. The young women who made them in India got just £1.50 per bag. One guest at the wedding was Sarajit Mitra, head of the Indian charity — I hope he was served the right kind of chapati. Mitra, WIF’s chief operating officer and son of the founder, has said that orders from Topshop declined after 2013 and stopped abruptly in June 2018 without any explanation from the prince or his team, which he described as “rude.”<br>
<br>
Despite this, in late August a royal source close to the prince said he was particularly dismayed that his efforts to help victims of sex trafficking were being overlooked while his connections with Epstein once again hit headlines....<br>
<br>
The British High Commission in India was responsible for introducing the duke to WIF. One key member of the Prince’s team Amanda Thirsk, his private secretary, was at the centre of the Key to Freedom project.<br>
<br>
Thirsk was the one who advised the prince to take part in his disastrous BBC Newsnight interview. She no longer works him.<br>
Andy’s ex-wife Ferguson came up with the Key to Freedom name and Andrew’s charitable trust donated £10,000 seed capital. The initiative launched formally in 2013, with an order from Sir Philip Green’s Topshop.<br>
<br>
Just like his refusal to talk about his relationship with Epstein, Andy is also saying nothing about these Indian charities and nor is Topshop, which was involved with the Key to Freedom project at the same time that top boss Green was himself facing allegations of sexual and racial harassment of staff.<br>
<br>
Andy and Fergie’s latest scam is to get you and I — the taxpayer — to pay for his other daughter Beatrice’s upcoming wedding just as we did for his daughter Eugenie’s three-and-a-half million pound bash.<br>
<br>
Most amazing is that Andrew, disgraced cheat and scam artist, remains the eighth inline to the throne. Do we need any better argument to get rid of the whole steaming shitheap that calls itself the monarchy?
</div></blockquote>

Yet, Sarah set up Sarah's Trust in 2020 with a link to a defunct 'charity' funded by Andrew??<br>
<br>
One of the interesting thing about this whole fiasco is that a few months ago I found a link between that WIF Indian charity and a fire that took place in Newhaven which I posted about. That fire took place in August 2020: <span style="color:#00FF40">Another fire at a warehouse at Newhaven Port in the UK and the building is linked to a baby charity "The Happy Baby Community"</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3965724" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3965724</a> Unfortunately I don't have my notes to hand to explain the link.. However..<br>
<br>
We know that in October 2020, the Supreme Master TV changed their address to Newhaven Enterprise Centre .. that's less than a mile away from the warehouse where the fire took place : <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/2q0jtf.jpg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/2q0jtf.jpg</a><br>
<br>
The Newhaven Enterprise Centre is an address that other companies associated with the Supreme Master Ching Hai association use.. and well before 2020. See: <span style="color:#00FF40">The World Preservation Foundation is a front for Ricky Dearman's Supreme Master Ching Hai cult with links to the Climate Institute, UN, Clintons.

The UK government website describes his official visit to Indonesia <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/his-royal-highness-prince-andrew-visited-indonesia" class="postlink">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/his- ... -indonesia</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>His Royal Highness Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, visited Indonesia on 18-20 September 2013. The visit focused on deepening UK bilateral relations including in trade and investment, science and innovation as well as education.<br>
<br>
During his visit, Prince Andrew met Vice President Prof Dr Boediono, Co-ordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Hatta Rajasa, Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan, Sultan of Yogyakarta Hamengkubuwono X, and Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo.</div></blockquote>

Then there was the unofficial visit: Prince Andrew faces fresh questions over three-week jaunt to the Far East that was backed by defence firms (and funded by the taxpayer) <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2445211/Prince-Andrew-faces-fresh-questions-week-jaunt-Far-East-backed-defence-firms-funded-taxpayer.html" class="postlink">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/articl ... payer.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>October 2013:<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew’s continued royal globe-trotting is expected to come under fresh scrutiny as he returns from a three-week, 21,258-mile ‘official’ trip. The Queen’s son, who was forced to give up his formal role as a UK trade ambassador after a string of scandals, has visited Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Japan and New York.<br>
<br>
The trip came just weeks after a separate trip to Qatar, another of his favourite destinations. The first leg of his tour of the Far East was funded in full by taxpayers, Buckingham Palace admitted last night. A one-way-business class ticket would cost at least £5,000.<br>
<br>
In both Tokyo and New York his expenses – including travel and accommodation – were in part subsidised by a private defence think tank which has appointed him to its board of ‘International Advisors’, the Mail has learnt. Founded in 1831 by the Duke of Wellington, the Royal United Services Institute is a respected independent, not-for-profit research body offering expert opinion on defence, security and terrorism...<br>
<br>
Andrew flew out of the UK – accompanied by a team of round-the-clock, publicly-funded police bodyguards – on September 16 to Jakarta, where he stayed for three days. The visit was, apparently, designed to promote ‘UK bilateral relations including in trade and investment, science and innovation as well as education’. He attended a dinner at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, opened the new British Embassy and attended a launch of a Government-backed tourism initiative.<br>
<br>
Details of the trip were not released until after his arrival, however, as Andrew is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publicise his foreign travel in advance.<br>
<br>
Palace officials confirmed last night that this leg of his journey was approved by the Royal Visits Committee at the request of the Foreign Office, which means that all his travel costs, hotels and expenses are met by taxpayers out of the Queen’s Sovereign Grant.<br>
<br>
...His last official engagement was on the evening of September 19, after which Andrew disappeared for a three-day weekend. Buckingham Palace said only that he spent the time ‘privately’. He then reappeared in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on September 23 for a two-day stay.<br>
<br>
Most notable in a series of engagements, was a high-level RUSI conference discussing UK-Vietnam defence co-operation and strategic issues in South-east Asia. Palace officials say the prince covered the cost of this part of his trip personally. His final engagement was on September 24 – after which the prince apparently took himself off on holiday again for five days. Again, palace officials have declined to discuss his movements.<br>
<br>
Andrew then turned up in Tokyo on Monday this week for another public, yet privately-funded, series of engagements. The main thrust of the prince’s visit was to attend a RUSI conference on British-Japanese security co-operation, where he shared the stage with<span style="color:#FF0040"> Sir John Scarlett, former Director of the Security Intelligence Service (MI6)</span>, and Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe...According to well-placed sources, the prince also took the opportunity to spend some time privately with the Japanese royal family.<br>
<br>
After initially refusing to discuss who was paying for the prince to be there, Buckingham Palace eventually admitted – after being challenged by the Mail – that RUSI had ‘made a proportionate contribution towards his costs’. The think-tank also funded him to fly on to New York on Wednesday this week, ostensibly to take part in further high-level discussions on its behalf. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">His arrival in Manhattan coincided with that of his youngest daughter, Princess Eugenie, who moved to the city to work for a year for an online auction company</span>. Andrew took Eugenie, 23, out for dinner on Wednesday night at ABC Kitchen. Buckingham Palace have refused to say when the prince is returning to the UK.</div></blockquote>

<br>
In March 2020 Paddle8 filed for bankruptcy :<br>
<br>
Paddle8 Is Filing for Bankruptcy—and It Owes Tens of Thousands of Dollars to Justin Bieber, Jay Z’s Foundation, and Others <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/paddle8-bankruptcy-1806951" class="postlink">https://news.artnet.com/art-world/paddl ... cy-1806951</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The online auction house Paddle8 has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York just one week after the New American Cinema Group, a nonprofit founded by the late filmmaker Jonas Mekas, filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly misappropriating funds from a charity auction...<br>
<br>
On March 10, Artnet News reported that the nonprofit (which is independent from the Anthology Film Archives, another organization founded by Mekas) had filed a lawsuit against Paddle8, alleging that the auction house was withholding funds from a benefit sale it hosted back in November.<br>
<br>
..“We are deeply concerned by Paddle8’s bankruptcy filing, particularly given that the director of Paddle8’s board, Peter Rich, specifically acknowledged Paddle8’s payment obligations to the nonprofit charity in writing less than a week ago, and assured us that Paddle8 had ‘made arrangements to settle your client’s monies due immediately,” Paul Cossu, an attorney for the New American Cinema Group, tells Artnet News.<br>
<br>
“It now appears that this was nothing but a bad-faith stalling tactic to buy Paddle8 time to wire money that should be going to charities to its lawyers.”...<br>
<br>
Among the creditors listed in Paddle8’s bankruptcy petition are pop star Justin Bieber and his wife Haley, who recently curated the recent “The Biebers x LIFT LA x Inner City Arts” auction. Paddle8 says it owes just over $73,000 to the couple.<br>
<br>
Jay Z’s Shawn Carter Foundation is also listed as a creditor, and is owed just over $65,000, presumably for a charity auction held last November.<br>
<br>
The Rema Hort Mann Foundation, the nonprofit founded by top New York City-based collectors Susan and Michael Hort in 1995 to honor their late daughter, also appears to be owed just over $100,000. The Hort Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2017, they launched The Anti-Slavery Collective, raising awareness and encouraging collaboration on anti-slavery.<br>
..In 2018, Eugenie and sister Beatrice spoke at a Conference against Modern Slavery at the UN. On another occasion, Eugenie spoke at the UN with Julia, and they have also been involved with the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women...<br>
