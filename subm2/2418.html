From 2010, in the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake...There was much speculation that the CNN reporter had 'unknowingly' stumbled across evidence of organ trafficking... certainly it was a very strange news clip from CNN.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">That CNN reporter was Elizabeth Cohen.. I'll get to her husband Tal Cohen later...</span><br>
<br>
Here she charts her journey to Haiti with a medical team from the University of Miami : <a href="https://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2010/01/15/expect-gettysburg/" class="postlink">https://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2010/01/ ... ettysburg/</a><br>

In this voat post I stumbled across yesterday: <span style="color:#00FF40">Rembrandt, Rothschild and Kaplan</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1762538" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1762538</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Thomas S. Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations as well as the International Council at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. ..They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies..<br>
<br>
<br>
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research. In 2012, the Kaplans created the <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Daisy and Paul Soros</span></span>/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri...<br>
<br>
Kaplan was in the news in The Netherlands last 19th February. <span style="color:#FF0040">Incidentally George Webb talked that day about a George Soros project for organ transplantations in Haiti <span style="text-decoration:underline">with involvement of the University of Miami</span>.</span></div></blockquote>

In Cohen's blog she mentions a few names, like : <span style="color:#00FF40">University of Miami trauma surgeon Dr. Enrique Ginzburg</span> <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2010/8/enrique-ginzburg" class="postlink">https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/ ... e-ginzburg</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ginzburg says he became intrigued with age management early in his medical career..Ginzburg started thinking more seriously about the topic of prolonging life. “I saw an advertisement for an anti-aging conference and attended a lecture given by Daniel Rothenberg, a doctor at the University of California at San Diego, on new uses for human growth hormone.”</div></blockquote>

Youth at Any Price: Growth Hormones and Aging <a href="https://consumer.healthday.com/encyclopedia/aging-1/age-health-news-7/youth-at-any-price-growth-hormones-and-aging-646167.html" class="postlink">https://consumer.healthday.com/encyclop ... 46167.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The debate started in 1990 when the late Daniel Rudman, MD, a researcher at the Medical College of Wisconsin, published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine..</div></blockquote>

Imagine my astonishment when I google images for Dr. Enrique Ginzburg and found him posing with Sean Penn and other Hollywood stars.. <span style="color:#00FF40">Lights! Camera! Scalpel!</span> <a href="https://physician-news.umiamihealth.org/lights-camera-scalpel/" class="postlink">https://physician-news.umiamihealth.org ... a-scalpel/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For a brief moment in Sean Penn’s new film, The Last Face, Enrique Ginzburg, M.D., is doing what the Miller School of Medicine trauma surgeon knows all too well: triaging bloodied and moaning patients in a makeshift hospital in one of the world’s most impoverished and unstable countries.</div></blockquote>

I'll come back to Penn in a little while..<br>
<br>
 Enrique Ginzburg, M.D. was involved with  <span style="color:#BFFF40">Project Medishare</span> along with Dr. Barth A. Green <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barth_A._Green" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barth_A._Green</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dr. Barth A. Green MD FACS is professor and chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Miami. He is also the co-founder of Project Medishare for Haiti, with Dr. Art Fournier.</div></blockquote>

A related voat post introduced Carnival Cruise Lines to the mix:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#00FF40">Micky Arison,owner of Miami Heat and chairman of Carnival Cruise Lines ,has connections to Medishare for Haiti, Clintons and Children's Museum of Miami which has a pedophile symbol.

MICKY ARISON <a href="https://www.nba.com/heat/contact/directoryarisonhtml/" class="postlink">https://www.nba.com/heat/contact/directoryarisonhtml/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As the leader of the most successful cruise operation in the world, the 70-year-old Arison and his family have always been involved with the team. Although <span style="color:#FF0040">his father, Ted, brought the NBA franchise to South Florida in 1988</span>, it has only been since Micky took control in 1995 that the HEAT has evolved into one of the NBA’s top organizations.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Arison, who was elected Chairman of the NBA Board of Governors in October 2005</span> and served a three-year term, brought to the HEAT the same standard of excellence that propelled Carnival Corporation &amp; plc into a global vacation leader. One of Arison’s first moves was to dramatically re-shape the franchise by hiring Pat Riley, one of the NBA's all-time winningest coaches, as Miami's President and that began a run of sustained excellence.</div></blockquote>

What, NBA? Only yesterday I posted this : <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;p=8561#p8561" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;p=8561#p8561</a><br>

More recently, he founded Healthshare Global to support medical education in Haiti and develop innovative health programs there.</div></blockquote>

So, what were the doctors doing in Haiti prior to the earthquake?  AIDS ... <span style="color:#00FF40">Once-condemned doctor turns to helping Haitians</span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180702222158/https://www.pressherald.com/2013/12/15/once-condemned_doctor_turns_to_helping_haitians_/" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20180702222 ... haitians_/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>NORTH MIAMI, Fla. — It may be hard to remember now, but there was a time when a mysterious autoimmune disease baffled doctors and frightened a world unfamiliar with what is now called AIDS. Arthur Fournier recalls the rise of the epidemic far better than most. In some ways it made him. In others, it nearly broke him. <br>
<br>
Above all, it helped define the rest of his life...For years, discrimination and recrimination against Haitians ensued. Fournier and the other doctors were blasted for committing bad science, asking biased questions, failing to employ Haitian Creole translators when talking with their patients and targeting an immigrant community derided as “boat people.”</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>“<em class="text-italics">First, Fauci &amp; Co. came for the Haitians and you did not speak out. 30-years later, drunk on their uncontested world rampages, where perpetual sickness means humongous profits, they’ve come for you! #Covid19 #Coronavirus #Faucifraud</em>“<br>
<br>
—–Èzili Dantò of HLLN, FreeHaiti, April 20, 2020</div></blockquote>

On April 20, 1990, hundreds of thousands of Haitians surrounded the U.S. Federal Building in lower Manhattan after flooding across the Brooklyn Bridge to protest CDC-Fauci-FDA fake science that Haitians were highly likely (high risk) to be HIV-AIDs carriers and contagious..<br>
<br>
I was there...April 20, 1990<br>
<br>
“I remember when the CDC-FDA with Dr. Anthony Fauci gave disease a Black face”<br>
<br>
I don’t know any other Haitian activists, academics, or doctors who’ve said this. Is it because Haiti’s schooled professionals, writers, academics, and intellectuals mostly work for our destroyers? We know the tragic Black collaborators need those jobs and grants so they are perhaps too fearful and beholden to the colonizers to speak up.<br>
<br>
I am an elder in this struggle, the few survivors still not integrated with the executioners and destroyers of my people. I’ll tell you about <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#FF0040">Dr. Fauci</span></span>, Trump’s Coronavirus medical expert, and how his kind created the disease they call <span style="color:#FF0040">HIV-AIDS</span> and then unleashed it, specifically on millions of neocolonially impoverished Black people worldwide. <br>
<br>
I’ll tell you that anything that has to do with Dr. Fankenstein-Fauci, the architect of the HIV-Aids binding element glycoprotein 120 that is said to have helped bring forth the HIV-AIDS death epidemic, is probably bio-engineered.  [Fauci patent: <a href="https://patents.justia.com/inventor/claudia-cicala" class="postlink">https://patents.justia.com/inventor/claudia-cicala</a>]<br>
<br>
..During the HIV-Aids crisis, the CDC/FDA with Fauci in the lead, set forth a health policy on blood donations that stigmatized Haitians as “Aids carriers.” There were no appropriate scientific facts to back it up whatsoever. In this Covid19 era, with Fauci front and center, I remember who they are, what they’ve done, historically. I must remember, so history cannot repeat itself.<br>
<br>
I remember how back then, Haiti workers working at nursing homes, hospitals, hotels, cafeterias, driving taxi cabs, and in private homes as housekeepers and cooks were stigmatized and <span style="color:#FFFF40">forced to “social distance”</span> – (i.e. got laid off, fired!) from the general population. I remember how confused these ladies doing ‘day work‘ at wealthy Greenwich CT homes, my mother’s friends were, when the families they’ve been working two decades for, suddenly became afraid of them and sent them home with the HIV-Aids carrier stigma.<br>
<br>
I remember we fought back the science “experts” the media still tout as infallible and forced the FDA and CDC to rethink messing around with Haitians like that! They had to quickly walk back their open racism and rescind their prejudice as Federal policy. <br>
<br>
But more, I remember Dr. Anthony Fauci, Trump’s leading health expert today, was a leading part of those from the CDC, NIH and FDA who simply decided Haitians and Africans were diseased. I remember.<br>
<br>
Those who forget and don’t tell this generation, sentence them to Covid19 stigma and social distancing for being “predisposed” vulnerable, which is on the horizon.<br>
<br>
..Recently, in an interview with the Breakfast Club, Fauci, supposedly the world’s leading expert in infectious disease stated that “there are very few things,” if anything people can do to boost their immune system. We know that’s a lie, just witchery and false.<br>
<br>
..30 years ago, on April 20, 1990, Haitians almost took down the Brooklyn Bridge in protest of the designation that they’re predisposed to be diseased! — I know they’re liars, pill pushers and have committed despicable crimes against humanity. (See, U.S. Guantanamo Bay Detention Prison Camp for Haiti refugees with HIV.; and, how CDC/NIH scientists hid increased autism in Black boys due to MMR Vaccines.)<br>
<br>
Records show Fauci was funding two Wuhan labs experimenting and bio-engineering with Coronavirus from bats right before the outbreak. At the same time in 2015, the U.S. government had a moratorium on funding for research into ways that certain viruses can be made more virulent and transmissible and the State Department was raising safety and security concerns about the labs at Wuhan in China and an accidental leaks...<br>
<br>
....I remember Fauci and big-pharma doctors like him, including Paul Farmer the UN Deputy Envoy to Haiti with Bill Clinton, helped cover-up UN-cholera in Haiti.<br>
<br>
I remember Haiti never had <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">cholera</span></span>, at least not for hundred years before the UN soldiers came...<br>
<br>
I remember <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Fauci</span></span> was clear that there “<em class="text-italics">is no cholera in Haiti, so it would be extremely unlikely that there would be an outbreak of cholera in Haiti, even though you don’t want to completely rule it out, it’s not the first thing that you think of when you think of an outbreak of waterborne disease.</em>” <a href="https://bit.ly/2VwLXG6" class="postlink">https://bit.ly/2VwLXG6</a><br>
<br>
Then seven months later, on October 25, 2010, when the cholera outbreak began killing impoverished Haitians by the thousands and we at the Haitian Lawyers Leadership (HLLN) pointed to evidence that the contagion spread started and was brought to the Meille River in Mirebalais by the UN soldiers, Fauci, without any investigation or scientific data, told the media that cholera “<em class="text-italics">must have been in Haiti already, beneath the surface, and poor sanitation helped trigger the outbreak.</em>”..<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">For, I remember the refusal – of the CDC, Fauci, the UN, UN deputy envoy Paul Farmer and the Clintons who were running Haiti (IHRC) – to quarantine the UN soldiers at Mirebalais.</span> I remember their refusal to test all UN soldiers and foreigners coming into Haiti for contagious diseases as Èzili’s HLLN requested. How these Colonists allowed the UN-cholera to freely spread until it became an epidemic. I know Haitians still suffer, to this day, from the Fauci/CDC/Clinton/UN-Paul Farmer initial cover-ups of the source of the cholera bacteria and failure to quarantine the initial carriers<br>

</div></blockquote>

Seems Haiti was just one big experimental lab. The Clintons et al are still walking around free.. so.. it seems... humanity attracts the karma it deserves.</div>

			<div class="content">Elizabeth Cohen's husband,<span style="color:#00FF40"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> Tal Cohen</span></span> <a href="https://atlantajewishtimes.timesofisrael.com/entrepreneur-profile-tal-cohen/" class="postlink">https://atlantajewishtimes.timesofisrae ... tal-cohen/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Tal Cohen has lived the American dream; interesting for a man who has lived more than half his life in Israel...<br>
<br>
After graduating high school, <span style="color:#FFFF40"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">he enlisted in the Israeli Navy and served aboard submarines</span></span>, a role in which he was able to continue his passion for learning how mechanical devices functioned.<br>
<br>
Upon completing his Naval service, Cohen attended Tel Aviv University, earning a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and graduating magna cum laude. Soon after that, he came to Georgia Tech to further his studies, earning his Ph.D. in engineering in 1995 and – “along the way” – a master’s degree in computer science.<br>
<br>
With these commendations, he was offered and accepted a faculty position at GT. From ’96 to 2000, he served as a full-time professor at the school, meanwhile developing a keen interest in data analytics and authoring numerous articles on data modeling and engineering information systems.<br>
<br>
Founding ClickFox<br>
<br>
In pursuing his personal passion for data analytics, Cohen – who now holds several patents in the aforementioned area – acquired an expertise that inspired several large companies to pursue his help. <span style="color:#BFFF40">Among his early consulting clients were General Motors, Boeing, the U.S. Air Force and several large financial institutions</span>.<br>
<br>
By the turn of the millennium, the entrepreneur could sense that his data mining talents could form the basis of a new company. Thus, he – <span style="color:#FFFF40">along with a friend from the <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Israeli Navy</span> – founded ClickFox</span>, which has become a pioneer and global market leader in providing <span style="color:#FFFF40">Customer Behavior Intelligence (CBI) software</span> and related service to a wide range of corporate customers.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">It is safe to say that most major financial institutions worldwide now use ClickFox’s services. What’s more, the company has the distinction of being the first in Georgia to receive significant funding from Israel</span> and today employs more than 100 people and has a multi-million dollar revenue stream.<br>
<br>
Mentor and Investor<br>
<br>
Following his success with ClickFox, Cohen continued to serve as an adjunct professor at Georgia Tech and still remains active in analyzing, reviewing, guiding and financing unique technology oriented for start-up companies. These efforts were formalized in 2011, when Georgia Tech established the start-up business accelerators program called <span style="color:#FFFF40">Flashpoint.</span>..<br>

			<div class="content">After thinking about it I'm dubious about the CNN video.  It's hard to believe that they let a reporter and camera crew rummage around and pick up a box of corneas and just wave it around willy nilly.  It's ridiculous TBH.  If anything the box (if indeed if ever was a box of corneas) was repurposed to store something else, like more snacks perhaps.  <br>
<br>
CNN report regarding rumors of organ trafficking in Haiti in 2010 <a href="https://archive.is/tb6x7" class="postlink">https://archive.is/tb6x7</a><br>
<br>
Then there's this interview with Elizi Danto briefly references George Webbs claims of organ trafficking at a Paul Farmer hospital start 18:58 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rntpda30_9g" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rntpda30_9g</a><br>
Start it up a 15:30 to include info about the pedo case she had worked on, mentions Hillary and Bill Clinton.  She goes on regarding how activists take sexual advantage of young Haitians in exchange for their charity for the cost of education etc.<br>

<br>
"Nonetheless, fear-mongering and conspiracy theories around contact tracing have been given still more momentum by the news that Massachusetts and other states are working with the Boston-based nonprofit health care organization Partners in Health to staff up their contact tracing programs. Co-founded in 1987 by Paul Farmer, PIH is best known for its work in Haiti combatting HIV and AIDS. But recently, as it has gotten involved in contact tracing during the coronavirus pandemic, PIH has become far more sinister for many conservatives and conspiracy theorists. Why? Because the Clinton Foundation and George Soros have funded it.<br>
Writer Stephanie Mencimer seemed particularly peeved about the talk of Paul Farmer and PIH in this article<br>

<br>
NOTE: *I don't agree with the aangirfan site's view of some of Roald Dahl's children's books, so at this point I'm dubious about other claims they make, pretty sure some on PG believed the site wasn't trustworthy so take it with a grain of salt (good advice on all sources TBH). Some notable comments regarding Dahl, anti-Israel.  There's a claim that Charles Marsh was a benefactor to Roald Dahl, and looking up the name in SV archives this recent post by @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2942" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">MercurysBall2</a> came up but I didn't find the match within it. Pfizer is reportedly asking for military bases and sovereign assets as guarantee for vaccines <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=2236" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=2236</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Roald Dahl (1916–1990), born in the UK to Norwegian parents, was an intelligence agent for MI6.<br>
<br>
and Physicians for Haiti: Change From Within <a href="https://give.brighamandwomens.org/stories/physicians-for-haiti/" class="postlink">https://give.brighamandwomens.org/stori ... for-haiti/</a><br>
<br>
BTW in defense of the kids' books, this describes Roald Dahl as characterizing witches as evil who are predators of children.  Today Roald Dahl would be cast out of civil society for such notions. <a href="https://alltruth.exposed/2019/07/27/the-pagan-agenda-witches-everywhere-children-as-targets-roald-dahl-and-hollywoods-phoenix-agenda/" class="postlink">https://alltruth.exposed/2019/07/27/the ... ix-agenda/</a><br>
<br>
****************<br>
so this link from SVVORDFISH was mentioned in the thread <a href="https://archive.is/9FsEr" class="postlink">https://archive.is/9FsEr</a> (I found it archived)  Points back to Tavistock, Wellcome Trust... and all manner of PG connections "Evidence that members of Comet Ping Pong's inner circle are working for organized crime ring located in the City of London, primarily consisting of a medical institution called the Wellcome Trust. Evidence suggests Wellcome is the primary engine of the elusive 'Tavistock' program that has been fodder for conspiracy theorists for decades."<br>
<br>
"The connections also reveal that Comet Ping Pong's James Alefantis and company use contemporary art and occult rituals to further the goals of this ring, which is loosely supported by American, British intelligence, along with the oligarchic Rockefeller and Rothschild families."</div>
