<br>
James Alefantis of Pizzagate scandal was executive producer of Automatic at Sea, occult movie with message of "secret pizza" interestingly movie was made between 2014-2016, so it was made before Pizzagate. Movie is about Eve who is welcomed by Peter on island, after some time Eve discovers darker side of Peter and wants to escape island, she is trapped in bizarre visions of occult, horned creatures and much more. One vision shows Eve consuming so called "secret pizza" at night. It's very cultish movie. Director of the movie Matthew Lessner made post about "Satan" after promoting his movie back in 2014, actor who plays Peter is David Henry Gerson, he is friend of James Alefantis and also - interestingly - friend of Nora Maccoby (whos also friends with James) who is friend with Anneke Lucas - victim of satanic ritual abuse ring (SRA) in Belgium.<br>
<br>
Footage for movie was being shot on Martha's Vineyard where Obamas or Rothschilds (Lynn and Evelyn) have their homes, Obamas home was described as "high end cult compound" by some people and that even was posted on Yahoo or AOL - more mainstream sites, but was deleted very fast in 2020. Dershowitz (abuser of Virginia Giuffre) claims he was introduced to Epstein by Lynn Forester de Rothschild on Martha's Vineyard. We know for some time now that James Alefantis and David Brock are somewhat close to Lynn Rothschild. Additionally Martha's Vineyard is location where John Podesta and his crew were discussing so called "pizza related map", thing that many people thought was a code for something else. John Podesta was there in August/September 2014, time when production of Automatic at Sea was reaching its climax. Closer analysis here:<br>

<br>
Movie can be watched here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6D3jMNn3C0" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6D3jMNn3C0</a><br>
<br>
00:00 - 03:27 - Introduction to David Henry Gerson, his friendship with Nora Maccoby and James Alefantis. Nora Maccoby connection with Anneke Lucas - victim of satanic ritual abuse in Belgium.<br>
<br>
03:28 - 4:50 - I show Mathew Lessner, director of the movie, strange posts about "Satan" and "secret pizza" he posted during production of Automatic at Sea.<br>
<br>
4:51 - 12:25 - Matthew Lessner said that Barack Obama was vacationing down the road when they were shooting footage for the movie in Chilmark, Martha's Vineyard. Interestingly in 2020 some mainstream articles in AOL and Yahoo described Obamas house as "high end cult compound", articles were deleted and only evidence of them can be found indirectly, not even archive exists.<br>
<br>
Barack Obama is also connected to Sarah Nixon and her daughter Maggie Nixon, these people are also connected to Martha's Vineyard island, Sarah Nixon is hanging out in circle of James Alefantis, taking pictures with him and his friends. Additionally James Alefantis was sitting beside Barack Obama around 2012 election time and he also likely visited Cuba with Obama in March 2016.<br>
<br>
Dershowitz who is accused of child abuse by Virginia Giuffre, just like Prince Andrew btw, is regular at Chilmark, Martha's Vineyard, that's where one of his homes is placed. Dershowitz claims he was introduced to Epstein by Lynn Forester de Rothschild on Martha's Vineyard. Lynn Forester de Rothschild and her husband Evelyn de Rothschild have mansion on Martha's Vineyard. Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Evelyn de Rothschild were socializing on Martha's Vineyard together. Additionally James Alefantis is close to Lynn Forester de Rotshchild, he was invited to her house in New York together with his ex boyfriend of Media Matters, David Brock.<br>
<br>
David Henry Gerson who plays Peter in Automatic at Sea has interesting family. His father Allan Gerson is important figure when it comes to international law, terrorism and anti-nazi efforts. Allan Gerson build his home (or one of) in Martha's Vineyard, Chilmark. <br>
<br>
Even John Podesta - another friend of James Alefantis, and brother of Tony Podesta who seems to be even closer friend of James - visited Martha's Vineyard, he allegedly left so called "pizza related map" there. Chilmark is among locations mentioned by people he mailed with about Martha's Vineyard vacation - Sandlers couple. <br>
<br>
12:26 - 14:30 - After Pizzagate scandal broke out Automatic at Sea descriptions with mention of secret pizza were changed but they were not changed on official site and YouTube trailer video. If James Alefantis used donations to be listed as executive producer of Automatic at Sea then he needed to give 10,000 US$ between November and December of 2015. Location for the movie says Chilmark, Martha's Vineyard.<br>
<br>
14:31 - 20:28 - At this point I'm showing screenshots from the movie Automatic at Sea. James listed as executive producer, book about occultism with drawings of pentagrams present in the movie, strange cult like figures on the island, Eve (main role) holding a goat, Im showing that they removed one scene with consumption of secret pizza that was in the trailer, but still one scene with pizza remains in the movie (or maybe the first one was never intended to be in the movie, who knows) Matthew Lessner (montelomax) posted part of the trailer in December 2015, there's Eve eating pizza in it, Lessner tagged it #secretpizza. Eve is trapped in bizarre vision of Peter turning into horned greek god pan, seeing visions of naked women on trees, dragons or even Peter performing with dragon on his back - dragon is biblical reference to Satan. When Eve wants to leave the island Peter turns into horned creature again and talks very creepy, then scene turns into Eve and horned man standing beside fire, very cult like stuff. Eve is consuming secret pizza at night in one of the scenes ...<br>
<br>
One of the people listed in credits (with special thanks) is Alice Waters and if thats the same person as Alice Louise Waters then she is friend of James Alefantis and sent him what appears to be a postcard for movie Metropolis. James took a picture with such angle that on the picture postcard shows only "Moloch Maschine". Moloch Maschine is reference to occult part of the movie which is based on the book, most, if not all references to the occult in the movie were allegedly deleted. Moloch is also deity associated with child sacrifice.<br>
<br>
20:29 - 25:31 - In this part I'm showing screenshots from Chapel Perilous movie, another movie produced by Matthew Lessner, James Alefantis and David Henry Gerson. Chapel Perilous when it comes to the occult world was a term used by Robert Anton Wilson who is known occult author who made books about Illuminati (trying to ridicule "conspiracy theorists") and he even used Aleister Crowley as character for his book (Crowley endorsed child sacrifice btw) Chapel Perilous means a psychological state where individual is uncertain if something was caused by supernatural force or was product of his own imagination.<br>
<br>
David plays Levi, he portrayed himself as modern day Moses when talking about his role in this movie. Levi goes through ritual of discovering his secret DNA which holds mysteries of the Universe, movie has a lot symbolism, it starts with one eye symbolism. This movie was outed before Pizzagate and Matthew Lessner (montelomax) himself was forced to delete his one eye symbol profile picture on YouTube, people accused him of being part of the Illuminati and he even confronted them by saying "be careful", its very strange to see him few years later being connected to actual alleged occult pedophile ring at the highest levels of our society. Lots of snake symbolism start to appear in the movie, Levi receives package with snakes, there's painting of woman with snake, there are snakes on Levi's trousers and there's reference to the book "Cosmic Serpent" about discovering secret message in our DNA through ritualistic Ayahuasca. Levi isn't drinking ayahuasca but he is going through ritual after which he receives direct sign from the "heavens" in form of horns on his head, allegedly they are part of him and that's why he was allegedly always obsessed with 10 commandments - this movie feels NOT right when it comes to its message to be honest. Movie ends with scene of woman and snake on her.<br>
<br>
Snake is obviously biblical reference to Satan. James Alefantis is listed as executive producer at the end of the movie.<br>
<br>
25:32 - 27:49 - The one eye symbolism was invented for the purpose of promoting another movie of Matthew Lessner - The Woods - which is basically hippie, leftist manifesto. Materials promoting it are filled with anti-American message. The one eye symbolism on hand has "Revolt" written under it.<br>
<br>
27:50 - 33:22 - This time I'm taking aim at David Henry Gerson Instagram profile. In 2012 posted one eye sticker promoting The Woods movie. David comments "Still revolting a year later". He also posted one eye symbolism with writing "don't trust anyone", that too was in 2012. In 2013 he posted hand with eye (the one promoting The Woods movie) behind Macbook, the eye on hand is placed behind camera location on Mac, David comments "Covering up the video camera on Macs to keep . them .. from secretly spying in on you". In 2013 he also posted drawing showing Adam and Eve in Garden of Eden, snake is present on this drawing. David Henry Gerson posted text about Jewish rebel tribe Maccabees. Nora Maccoby comments it ... It seems to me that Maccobys share common origin with Gersons and many more of the suspects in Pizzagate ... That is Jewish origin.<br>
<br>
Nora Maccoby often comments David Henry Gerson profile, I wonder what's the relation between them - but I'm not trying to implicate anything specific. Nora Maccoby is on the other hand link between Dutroux ring circle and Pizzagate circle because Nora Maccoby is friends with Anneke Lucas - victim of satanic ritual abuse in Belgium. It was satanic because it was connected to satanic cults and allegations of ritual aspects by many witnesses and even actual legit occult organization who were connected to Dutroux associates (not mentioned in the compilation tho)<br>
<br>
Nora Maccoby is ofc socializing with James Alefantis alone and with her sister - Izette Maccoby Folger who works at the board of Innocents at Risk - organization combating child trafficking.<br>
<br>
There are some strange coincidences of same people who were accused during early Pizzagate research being connected to Nora Maccoby and some of them go on liking her profile to this day, interestingly that happens alongside Anneke Lucas.</div>
