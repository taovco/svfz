<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A human trafficking lawsuit identified as one of the first of its kind — filed by a victim against a hotel owner or operator — recently settled out of court, NPR reports...<br>
<br>
The lawsuit filed in Massachusetts involves a woman who accused The Shangri-La Hotel in Seekonk, Massachusetts, its operator and its on-site manager of ignoring clear signs she was in distress.<br>
<br>
The case, identified by NPR as one of the first filed against a hotel operator under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003, could serve as a bellwether for dozens of other cases filed across the U.S. against small and major hotel brands for allegedly allowing or failing to stop human trafficking on their premises. ..<br>
<br>
“These are not cases where maybe somebody was raped or sexually assaulted in a room and there was no way for the hotel or business to know about it," McAdams told Bisnow last year. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">“These are cases where there is undeniable evidence that these hotels facilitated this behavior and knew that it was going on — whether it was 40 people in one room throughout a two-day period or six girls who were recovered from one hotel in different rooms. We have a situation where a 14-year-old was moved freely from room to room.</span> Situations where it was undeniable that there were signals something was going on.”</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Wings Club was born in New York City on May 15, 1942, in the early days of World War II, when a number of America’s aviation leaders decided to band together to find a suitable meeting place where they could gather to help chart the future course of aeronautics...<br>
<br>
To establish the club’s leadership in civil and military aviation, a number of honorary members were elected, including:<br>
<br>
General Hap Arnold, the commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces;<br>
L. Welch Pogue, chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board;<br>
Dr. Jerome Hunsaker, chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Fiorello LaGuardia</span>, the aviation-minded mayor of New York.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Initially using The Yale Club</span> in midtown Manhattan as its headquarters, The Wings Club soon became a rallying place where aviation-minded people could discuss the latest aircraft and flying techniques.<br>
<br>
..The Wings Club’s first Annual Dinner was held on March 22, 1944 at the famous Waldorf=Astoria Hotel. Noted military pilot and Eastern Air Lines executive Eddie Rickenbacker was the keynote speaker.<br>
<br>
The hotel also was the site of a special meeting of The Wings Club in 1945, when a film showing the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was aired publicly for the first time during a Wings Club dinner honoring returning U.S. military aviators.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">By April 1, 1946, The Wings Club had moved to the Biltmore Hotel</span>, where it remained until relocating to 52 Vanderbilt Avenue on March 15, 1983.

Fiorello La Guardia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorello_La_Guardia" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorello_La_Guardia</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Before serving as mayor, La Guardia represented Manhattan in Congress and on the New York City Board of Aldermen. As mayor, during the Great Depression and World War II, La Guardia unified the city's transit system; expanded construction of public housing, playgrounds, parks, and airports; reorganized the New York Police Department; and implemented federal <span style="color:#00FF40">New Deal</span> programs within the city.<br>
<br>
..La Guardia was also a major national political figure. His support for the New Deal and relationship with President Franklin D. Roosevelt crossed party lines, brought federal funds to New York City, and cut off patronage to La Guardia's enemies. La Guardia's WNYC radio program "Talk to the People," which aired from December 1941 until December 1945, expanded his public influence beyond the borders of the city.<br>
<br>
..La Guardia was born in Greenwich Village, New York City on December 12, 1882. His father, Achille La Guardia, was a Catholic native of Cerignola, Italy.[5] His mother, Irene Luzzatto Coen, was a Jewish native of Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire;<span style="color:#00FF40"> his maternal grandmother Fiorina (Luzzatto) Coen was a Luzzatto, a member of the prestigious Italian-Jewish family of scholars, kabbalists, and poets and had among her ancestors the famous rabbi Samuel David Luzzatto</span>.[citation needed] La Guardia's parents met and married in Trieste..<br>
<br>
He and Robert Moses built highways, bridges and tunnels, transforming the physical landscape of New York City. The West Side Highway, East River Drive, Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, Triborough Bridge, and two airports (LaGuardia Airport, and, later, Idlewild, now JFK Airport) were built during his mayoralty..<br>
<br>
1939 was a busy year, as he opened the 1939 New York World's Fair at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, Queens, opened New York Municipal Airport No. 2 in Queens (later renamed Fiorello H. LaGuardia Field), and had the city buy out the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, thus completing the public takeover of the New York City Subway system. ..<br>
<br>
In 1943, La Guardia saved the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Mecca Temple</span> on 55th Street from demolition. Together with New York City Council President Newbold Morris, La Guardia converted the building to the New York City Center of Music and Dance. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">La Guardia was a Scottish Rite Freemason and was a member of Garibaldi Lodge #542 in New York City</span></div></blockquote>

But there’s a lot more to this.<br>
<br>
On March 9th, 2008, Buffalo News broke a story involving New York Supreme Court Justice Ronald Tills, Erie County, NY Deputy Michael Lesinski, Lockport, NY Police Captain John Trowbridge and New York State Law Clerk Michael Stebick participating in a human trafficking operation that involved transporting undocumented immigrant sex workers from as far as Kentucky to New York and Canada.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
They were transporting the young women to and from a private event held by The Royal Order of Jesters, of whom paid for the sex workers and quiet police transport....<br>
<br>
These pictures I’ve been posting? They’re from another investigation in Brazil, of — you guessed it — The Royal Order of Jesters participating in sex, drug use, and other illicit acts with Brazilian girls as young as 13..<br>
<br>
The Jesters were operating under the guise of a local fishing tour company called Wet-A-Line. The photos, as well as testimony of human trafficking, arose under a Defamation lawsuit in Texas that arose when a competing fishing-tour company discovered the operation.
