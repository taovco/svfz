			<div class="content">Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Order of Saint John.  You can track their charity connections to the Children's Action Network here: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;p=9953#p9953" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;p=9953#p9953</a>  I also pointed to Commander Isabelle Paul who is the head of the Florida chapter.

Isabelle Paul and her husband owned the Bay Roc Hotel, Montego Bay, Jamaica <em class="text-italics">[Jamaica is to the left of Haiti..just saying</em>].. the precursor to the Sandals Hotel chain <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front/paradise-postponed-6826496.html" class="postlink">https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front/par ... 26496.html</a><br>

In the post <em class="text-italics">David Bowie music video and George Floyd - when worlds collide...</em> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2786" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2786</a> I explain how a priest ordained by Bishop McManus in St. Paul Cathedral after which he joined Saint John's Seminary (Massachusetts) , along with other Catholic priests, has been visiting sites at the Mexican border that we suspect are involved with the human trafficking ratlines. In addition, their involvement with children's charities is highlighted.  Founders of the Starlight Foundation include Steven Spielberg and Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. whose father belonged to St. John's Lodge #1.<br>

As explained in that post, another related thread is <em class="text-italics">Ames Research Center is the NASA complex housing immigrant children: Related post: Ames Research Center (NASA), Singularity University, Epstein and the Occult - NOTES</em> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3698903" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3698903</a> <br>

The emphasis at the summit was on the “longevity dividend” rather than the “ageing demographic time bomb”. Note the positivity. Many businesses see huge opportunities ahead because those over the age of 50 hold 70 per cent of UK household wealth. There is also employment potential for the young — a re-distribution of wealth where both sides win...<br>

The one billion retired people globally are a multi-trillion dollar opportunity for business,” said Dmitry Kaminskiy, co-author of the UK Longevity Industry Report and managing partner of Deep Knowledge Ventures, who was a panellist at last week’s event.

Well, I think that logo is quite appropriate, apart from the obvious relation to lifeboats.  The Order of St John has marine rescue connections as well as to funding nanotechnology research.  I can't remember atm where I read about the nanotechnology links but an example of such is Dr Mark Welland : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Welland" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Welland</a><br>

You'll note the red and white colours of the order and which I pointed to in this post: The Ivermectin Psyop.....imho <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2328" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2328</a> about the 'COVID Hunter' and other posts such as <em class="text-italics">There's Something Strange about the Order of St. John. 40% of Brothers Have Been Accused of Child Sexual Abuse.</em> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2138955" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2138955</a><br>

St John's College, Cambridge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's ... _Cambridge</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>St John's College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge (the full, formal name of the college is the College of St John the Evangelist in the University of Cambridge[3]) founded by the Tudor matriarch Lady Margaret Beaufort. ..The college's alumni comprise the winners of 12 Nobel Prizes (including physicists Paul Dirac, Roger Penrose and Max Born, the latter having been affiliated with the college in the 1930s), seven prime ministers and 12 archbishops of various countries, at least two princes and three saints...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040"> Prince William was affiliated with the college while undertaking a university-run course in estate management in 2014.</span><br>
<br>
The site was originally occupied by the Hospital of St John the Evangelist, probably founded around 1200.[10] The hospital infirmary was located where the <span style="color:#FF0040">east end</span> of the current chapel now stands.. Lady Margaret Beaufort, having endowed Christ's College sought to found a new college, and chose the hospital site at the suggestion of John Fisher, her chaplain and Bishop of Rochester...<br>
<br>
St John's remains a great rival of Trinity College, which is its main competitor in sports and academia. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">St John's and the abolition of the British slave trade</span><br>
<br>
As part of the commemoration of the bicentenary of the 1807 Act, and as a representative of one of the Ivy League universities offering American historical perspective on the <span style="color:#FF0040">Triangular Trade</span>, President Ruth J. Simmons of Brown University (herself a descendant of American slaves) gave a public lecture at St John's College entitled <span style="color:#FF0040">"Hidden in Plain Sight: Slavery and Justice in Rhode Island"</span> on 16 February 2007. </div></blockquote>

Well, the abolition of the slave trade story is a little more complicated than that wiki narrative.. I'll get to that later..<br>
<br>
Searching for 'st john lifeboats' will take us to : <em class="text-italics">Ferryside Inshore Lifeboat St John Ambulance's only water-based division</em> <a href="https://www.ferryside-lifeboat.co.uk/our-history/" class="postlink">https://www.ferryside-lifeboat.co.uk/our-history/</a><br>

So, not so independent of each other. I did a search for Elizabeth and the double-headed eagle: Elizabeth Tokens found at Jamestown <a href="https://historicjamestowne.org/collections/artifacts/elizabethan-token/" class="postlink">https://historicjamestowne.org/collecti ... han-token/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A total of 26 tokens of this type have been excavated at Jamestown. So far, they have not been found on any other archaeological site in the United States... The tokens depict an English crown above the Tudor rose with the initials ER and the legend GOD SAVE THE QVENE on the obverse side and a double-headed eagle on the reverse. Because of this iconography, they are believed to be associated with Queen Elizabeth I. The double-headed eagle may be a representation of the Queen’s role as both the secular leader and the titular head of the Anglican Church. It is unclear whether Elizabeth herself commissioned the manufacturing of these tokens, or what their original use in England was. At Jamestown, it is likely that the tokens were used for trade with the Virginia Indians or within the fort as currency.</div></blockquote>

Jamestown, Virginia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Jamestown[a] settlement in the Colony of Virginia was the first permanent English settlement in the Americas..It was established by the Virginia Company of London as "James Fort" on May 4, 1607 O.S. (May 14, 1607 N.S.)..<br>
<br>
In August 1619, the first recorded slaves from Africa to British North America arrived in what is now Old Point Comfort near the Jamestown colony, on a British privateer ship flying a Dutch flag. The approximately 20 Africans from the present-day Angola had been removed by the British crew from a Portuguese slave ship, the "São João Bautista".[10][11] They most likely worked in the tobacco fields as slaves under a system of race-based indentured servitude.[12] The modern conception of slavery in the colonial United States was formalized in 1640 (the John Punch hearing) and was fully entrenched in Virginia by 1660..<br>
<br>
The London Company's second settlement in Bermuda claims to be the site of the oldest town in the English New World, as St. George's, Bermuda was officially established in 1612 as New London, whereas James Fort in Virginia was not converted into James Towne until 1619, and further did not survive to the present day...<br>
<br>
Today, <span style="color:#FF0040">Jamestown is one of three locations composing the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia</span>, along with Williamsburg and Yorktown, with two primary heritage sites. Historic Jamestowne[15] is the archaeological site on Jamestown Island and is a cooperative effort by Jamestown National Historic Site (part of Colonial National Historical Park) and Preservation Virginia. Jamestown Settlement, a living history interpretive site, is operated by the Jamestown Yorktown Foundation, a state agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia.<br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_Rebellion" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_Rebellion</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>According to the Historic Jamestowne National Park website, "For many years, historians considered the Virginia Rebellion of 1676 to be the first stirring of revolutionary sentiment in [North] America, which culminated in the American Revolution almost exactly one hundred years later. However, in the past few decades, based on findings from a more distant viewpoint, historians have come to understand Bacon's Rebellion as a power struggle between two stubborn, selfish leaders rather than a glorious fight against tyranny."[38]<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, many in the early United States, including Thomas Jefferson, saw Bacon as a patriot and believed that Bacon's Rebellion truly was a prelude to the later American Revolution against the control of the Crown.[39][40] This understanding of the conflict was reflected in 20th-century commemorations, including a memorial window in Colonial Williamsburg and a prominent tablet in the Virginia House of Delegates chamber of the State Capitol in Richmond, which recalls Bacon as "A great Patriot Leader of the Virginia People who died while defending their rights October 26, 1676."[39][40][41] Subsequent to the rebellion, the Virginia colonial legislature enacted Virginia Slave Codes of 1705, which created several strict laws upon people of African background. Additionally, the codes were aimed socially segregate the white and black races.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>John F. Koons III, head of the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach and father of Palm Beach County Commissioner Jeff Koons, died Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach. He was 80.<br>
<br>
Mr. Koons, known as "Jack" or "Bud" to friends and family, was born in Cincinnati. He dropped out of the University of Arizona at the beginning of World War II to join the Marines. He later graduated from Babson College in Massachusetts. He ran Midland Advertising and the Burger Brewery, which sponsored Cincinnati Reds games.<br>
<br>
He then founded Central Investment Corp. with bottling and food industries in Florida and Ohio. A lifelong sports enthusiast, Mr. Koons also traveled widely. He joined his friend, Tip O'Neil, when the House Speaker was given an honorary degree at Trinity University in Dublin, Ireland.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">He also was the father-in-law of the late singer Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.</span><br>
<br>
Mr. Koons served on a number of boards, including the Betty Ford Center and Evergreen State College, and belonged to several clubs including Ibis and Burning Tree Country Club in northern Palm Beach County.<br>
<br>
He is survived by Patricia Boyle Koons, his wife of 42 years; his children Jeff Koons, of West Palm Beach, Deborah Koons Garcia, of Mill Valley, Calif., James Koons, of Eugene, Ore., and Christina Koons, of Seattle; and seven grandchildren.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2010:<br>
<br>
Koons, a Democrat, was charged with felony extortion, misdemeanor perjury and violating public-meeting and public-record laws.<br>
<br>
Prosecutors say Koons in May left profanity-laced voicemail messages for the representative of property owners opposing the South Cove project, saying he was going to use his influence to "put them through the ringer on this" and "throw them under the [expletive] bus" if they didn't support the project.<br>
<br>
Investigators also said that Koons had county employees photograph property owned by opponents of the South Cove project and that Koons then suggested that he would call in the code-enforcement department, even though "there were no legitimate code-enforcement issues," according to the Probable Cause Affidavit from the State Attorney's Office.<br>
<br>
...wo weeks ago, the State Attorney's Office requested county records about South Cove — which calls for planting mangrove islands to provide marine habitat and building a boardwalk to bring people closer to the water in downtown West Palm Beach, County Administrator Robert Weisman said.<br>
<br>
Those records included e-mails between county officials and representatives of a group of residents at the Trump Plaza condo towers that opposes the project planned in front of their building, Weisman said.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>When a visitor arrives, West Palm Beach City Commissioner Jeff Koons drops the newspaper he's been reading, stands up, and shakes hands like a politician on the campaign trail, even though he was reelected just a few months ago. He suddenly announces: "We have an errand to run."<br>
<br>
Hurrying toward the elevator on the fifth floor of West Palm Beach City Hall, he's headed to one of his favorite places in the city: <span style="color:#FF0040">the Ann Norton Sculpture Garden</span>, of which he's a board member. ..<br>
<br>
..Koons has plenty of explaining to do. During the divorce proceedings, his father, Bud, eliminated his son's $500,000 job as vice president of field operations for the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach. The Riviera Beach-based bottler is owned by the elder Koons' $165 million company, Central Investment Corporation (CIC), for which Jeff Koons worked for 28 years. Bud Koons would not speak to New Times for this article, and his son claims that he is simply on a "leave of absence."..<br>
<br>
Whatever his status with the company now, Koons admitted, in deposition and during the divorce trial, that he has used his $16,000-a-year job as a city commissioner to reap financial benefits for Pepsi. He explained that he's done dozens of political favors on the company's behalf...</div></blockquote>

The Merry Pranksters are comrades and followers of American author Ken Kesey in 1964.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters lived communally at Kesey's homes in California and Oregon, and are noted for the sociological significance of a lengthy road trip they took in the summer of 1964, traveling across the United States in a psychedelic painted school bus called Furthur, organizing parties <span style="color:#FF0040">and giving out LSD</span>. During this time they met many of the guiding lights of the mid-1960s cultural movement and presaged what are commonly thought of as hippies with odd behavior, tie-dyed and red, white and blue clothing, and renunciation of normal society, which they dubbed The Establishment. Tom Wolfe chronicled their early escapades in his 1968 book <em class="text-italics">The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</em>, and documents a notorious 1966 trip on Furthur from Mexico through Houston, stopping to visit Kesey's friend, novelist Larry McMurtry.<br>

Notable members of the group include Kesey's best friend Ken Babbs, Carolyn "Mountain Girl" Garcia, Lee Quarnstrom, and Neal Cassady.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>.. having doubts about the validity of the Camp Winna Rainbow and the Seva foundation's good intentions for children..Alot of tie dye hippies send thier kids to Wavy every year for the sake of tie dye and juggling. They get the broken family inner city kids for free. But who gets lucky them or the kids? Thats what im wondering. ....My friend getting nasty about the phrase pizzagate in the same breath as defending Seva and the Rex foundation, brought back my memory of why I had doubts at all...<br>
<br>
..I was in the midst of being sued for custody of my child, 7 year old girl by her father who had at that time recently come out as "transgender" woman, a total surprise to me at the time. He was taking me to court on the regular and I was losing for some odd reason (Marin family court most corrupt in the world) anyways...perhaps cause he had the gaypower mojo and lots of money working for him/her. It was pretty weird. In anycase he/She wanted to take our girl to camp winnarainbow. I thought she was too young because he/she was actually working there as a job for Wavy Gravy and wouldn't be with our daughter most of the time...<br>
<br>
.. My first search off google probaby or maybe ask jeeves was : "camp winnarainbow sucks" because that's how i used to check if there were complaints listed about a company. Well the results were some bad reviews but also lots of sex stuff. Kid porn stuff like boys getting ducked and shit. It freaked me out. It was gay video stuff. I wish I took a screen shot of all the sex video stuff that said camp winnatainbow. I was just tripping when I found that stuff. I flashed back to the 1980s I had been in a car on a long trip listening to kpfa and Wavy Gravy was on the radio talking about Camp winnarainbow for adults, which happens right after the kid camp, but he was talking about it as if it were a great big orgy...<br>
<br>
...i made copies of those pages by print out and gave them to the court to justify my concerns and questions about Wavy Gravy and him having anything to do with children. I was very worried. After I showed those print outs to the court, my kids dad was fired from winnarainbow but they are all still friends. Wavy and his wife jahanra who used to be Bonnie somebody an actress from twilight zone. Perfect right?... But specifically I asked what are all these porn sites that seem related to camp winnarainbow? After that I got back on line searching out their funding or whatever. I'm really not a trained researcher, but I was interested...Seva came up, the Aravind clinic in India...doing good things...for sex workers...It got so weird searching Seva, cause it seemed like the sex worker transgender thing was an agenda, it seemed like sex work counseling was an agenda, and women and girls in poverty too, and the eye clinic. (Organ harvesting had crossed my mind) When I tried to talk about it. People shut me down like the afore mentioned exfriend. That was 2009..<br>
<br>
later 2011, searching just under my kid's dad's girls name I found a porn site that actually belonged to him/her. He/She was selling porn off the internet, I showed it to deputies who made a report and had investigators investigate especially because they looked like kids in the videos. The report is number 1258 thats all they ever told me after that.The report is confidential and I can't get my hands on it, and it's not illegal to sell porn. So the family court judge bev woods didn't give a shit if he is a fucking porn peddling he/she- who's got the money? That's all Beverley Woods cares about. <br>

What on earth?  I went looking for Einstein around that time and bumped into this: <a href="https://time.com/5795646/albert-einstein-birthday-pi-day/" class="postlink">https://time.com/5795646/albert-einstei ... ay-pi-day/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Albert Einstein celebrating his 70th birthday with children from a displaced persons camp on Mar. 13, 1949, at his home in Princeton, N.J. Gamma-Keystone—Getty Images
<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/g72u9c.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

Albert Einstein’s March 14 birthday is always cause for celebration. In past years, children in Princeton, N.J. — the theoretical physicist’s home for about two decades — have participated in an Einstein look-alike contest, and in San Francisco people would sing him the Happy Birthday song while circling <span style="color:#FF0040">a shrine to Pi</span> at the Exploratorium science museum. (March 14 is also known as Pi Day for its tie to the first digits of Pi, 3.14.)..<br>
<br>
One birthday party he did like, however, was for his 70th — thanks to some very special visitors.<br>
<br>
On March 13, 1949, the day before Einstein’s birthday, children who had just been relocated to the U.S. from a displaced persons camp in Europe visited his home in Princeton, where he taught at the Institute for Advanced Study. Even four years after World War II ended, many who had been made homeless by the war had yet to be settled.<br>
<br>
One of the children brought to the U.S. was even related to Einstein: 11-year-old Elizabeth Kerzek, a distant cousin, who met her famous relative for the first time at this celebration. In the photo above, the man next to Einstein is William Rosenwald, an honorary president of the United Service for New Americans (USNA), the organization that brought the children over, as well as chairman of United Jewish Appeal....<br>
<br>
Einstein could relate to the plight of being uprooted, as a German Jewish refugee himself. He came to the U.S. in October 1933, months after he was forced to flee his Berlin home ..That same year, Einstein had helped establish the American branch of the International Relief Association, a European forerunner to the <span style="color:#FF0040">International Rescue Committee</span>, which aimed to rescue those threatened in Nazi Germany. Up until his death on April 18, 1955, he used his name recognition from developing a general theory of relativity to help others come to the U.S. to escape persecution, serving as an honorary president of the French Jewish social welfare organization OSE (short for Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants, or the Children’s Aid Society).</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://rollingstoneindia.com/deborah-koons-garcia/" class="postlink">https://rollingstoneindia.com/deborah-koons-garcia/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In an exclusive e-mail interview, Deborah Koons Garcia discusses her late husband’s fascination with India and Indian music...<br>
<br>
Jerry began listening to Indian music in the Sixties when wonderful Indian musicians began playing here in the States. He often played at the same festivals and concerts as great Indian musicians like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan and Zakir Hussain. Mickey Hart, who also played in the Grateful Dead, was especially interested in recording and collaborating with classical Indian musicians at his home studio in Marin County outside San Francisco back in the 1970’s. Jerry was sometimes part of these sessions...<br>
<br>
Jerry and I had planned a trip to India with Sanjay and after he died I wanted to continue on. As my friends and I were getting ready for the trip, <span style="color:#FF0040">Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead</span> had a dream that we should put Jerry’s ashes in the Ganges. I agreed. Weir came to Rishikesh in 1996 and Sanjay was with us too. It was moving...<br>
<br>
I went back to India this year to shoot part of my new film there, a documentary on soil called <em class="text-italics">In Good Heart- Soil and the Mystery of Fertility</em>. It is a kind of follow up to my last film,<em class="text-italics"><span style="color:#FF0040"> The Future of Food</span></em>, which is about the changes happening in the food system today, especially those caused by genetic engineering plants. India is especially interesting because it is a land of small farmers, who are facing huge problems with debt, soil fertility, access to seeds, water and markets...The whole Organic Movement was inspired by Sir Albert Howard, who was inspired and educated by Indian farmers..

			<div class="content">Hog Farm was right next to Camp  Winnarainbow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Beecher" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Beecher</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Hog Farm is an organization considered America's longest running hippie commune. Beginning as a collective in North Hollywood, California, during the 1960s, a later move to an actual hog farm in Tujunga, California gave the group its name. Founded by peace activist and clown Wavy Gravy (Hugh Romney) and his actress wife Jahanara Romney (Bonnie Jean Beecher), the Hog Farm evolved into a "mobile, hallucination-extended family", active internationally in both music and politics...<br>
<br>
The Hog Farm is perhaps best known for their involvement with the Woodstock Music Festival. While lodging on Manhattan's East Side from 1968–69, the Farm was approached by Woodstock Ventures with a proposal: participate in a planned music festival in upstate New York. Although the Farm had just bought land in Llano, New Mexico (near Truchas) and had plans to depart New York City and settle in their new home, they accepted the offer to become involved with Woodstock. Recruited to build fire pits and trails on the festival grounds at Woodstock, the Hog Farm convinced the promoter to let them set up a free kitchen as well.<br>
<br>
The Hog Farm group was flown to New York, were met by the international press at JFK Airport, and told for the first time that they had also been assigned the task of providing festival security. Gravy called his rather unorthodox security force the "Please Force", a reference to their non-intrusive tactics at keeping order ("please don't do that, please do this instead"). When asked by the press what kind of tools he intended to use to maintain order at the event, his response was "Cream pies and seltzer bottles."<br>
<br>
Shortly after Woodstock, the Hog Farmers helped keep the peace between the cowboys and the hippies at the Texas International Pop Festival, where blues musician B. B. King gave Wavy Gravy his name.<br>
<br>
Recruited by San Francisco underground radio pioneer Tom Donahue and<span style="color:#FF0040"> Warner Brothers Records </span>to travel from San Francisco, California to New York and be filmed for a movie called Cruising for Burgers or We Have Come for Your Daughters, later renamed Medicine Ball Caravan, the Hog Farmers bussed themselves across America, setting up stages for mainstream rock artists.<br>
<br>
 Finally, in 1970 after a concert with Pink Floyd in Bishopsbourne, England, the Farmers pooled their movie salaries basically; they received $100.00 each from Warner Brothers for the work they did while traveling across the U.S. for the purpose of promoting various musical groups that they had contracted with. As well, some funds were raised for them from a benefit staged by a London commune at the Roundhouse. They continued their trek across Europe and into India, where they decided to continue to Kathmandu, Nepal, where they worked as extras in the 1971 movie Hare Rama Hare Krishna, by Bollywood director Dev Anand. After that, they were invited by the then King of Nepal to visit the palace in Pokhara several hundred miles west of Kathmandu.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Stewart Brand (Whole Earth Catalog founder and editor)</span>, contacted the Swedish Government when he heard that the United Nations would host the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in June 1972 in Stockholm, Sweden. As America was constantly having antiwar demonstrations protesting the US involvement in Vietnam, he worried that in Stockholm that summer, perhaps violent protests might break out and thought that by sending a group of Hog Farmers over there, they might be able to be a calming center as they had done at Woodstock and other events. As it turned out, though, there weren't any protests at all. In 1974 the Swedish rock singer Pugh Rogefeldt wrote the song "Hog Farm" to criticize the community's use of drugs while visiting Stockholm; the song appears on the album Bolla och Rulla.<br>
<br>
Today the Hog Farm continues in various locations, including a headquarters in Berkeley, California and a 600+ acre farm in Laytonville, California, known as Black Oak Ranch, which is also home to Wavy Gravy's performing arts camp for children, Camp Winnarainbow.</div></blockquote>

The <em class="text-italics">Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link</em>, normally shortened to The WELL, is one of the oldest virtual communities in continuous operation. ..<br>
<br>
The WELL was started by Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant in 1985, and the name (an acronym for Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link)[4] is partially a reference to some of Brand's earlier projects, including the Whole Earth Catalog. Initially The WELL was owned 50% by The Point Foundation (publishers of the Whole Earth Catalog and Whole Earth Review) and 50% by NETI Technologies Inc. a Vancouver-based company of which Larry Brilliant was at that time the chairman. ..<br>
<br>
From 1994 to 1999 The WELL was owned by Bruce R. Katz, founder of Rockport, a manufacturer of walking shoes. In April 1999 it was acquired by Salon, several of whose founders such as Scott Rosenberg had previously been regular participants there. In September 2012, Salon sold The WELL to a new corporation, The WELL Group Inc., owned by a group of eleven investors, who are all long-time members. <br>
<br>
Notable items in WELL history include being the forum through which John Perry Barlow, John Gilmore, and Mitch Kapor, the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, first met. Howard Rheingold, an early and very active member, was inspired to write his book The Virtual Community by his experience on The WELL. According to Rheingold's book, The WELL's Usenet feed was for years provided by Apple Computer over UUCP. The WELL was a major online meeting place for fans of the Grateful Dead, especially those who followed the band from concert to concert, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The WELL also played a role in the book Takedown about the pursuit and capture of Kevin Mitnick. Founded in Sausalito, California, the service is now based in Emeryville...<br>
<br>
The directors of The WELL have included Matthew McClure and Cliff Figallo, both veterans of the 1970s commune called The Farm, and Gail Williams, previously known as one of the principals in the political satire group the Plutonium Players. In 2016, The WELL hired Christian Ruzich and Daryl Lynn Johnson, who have over 30 years of combined experience on The WELL, to be the General Managers...

John F. Koons, III died on March 3, 2005, survived by two ex-wives, four children and seven grandchildren. Koons had operated Central Investment Corp. (CIC), which primarily bottled and distributed Pepsi products and also sold vending machine items. Koons owned 46.9% of the company's voting stock and 51.5% of its nonvoting stock in 2004. His children owned most of the remaining stock, either directly or through trusts, while other family members and trusts held the remaining shares.<br>
<br>
CIC and PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo), became involved in a dispute over exclusivity rights that led to litigation in 1997. The parties later resolved the dispute. CIC sold its soft-drink and vending-machine businesses to PepsiAmericas, Inc. (PAS), an affiliate of PepsiCo, under the terms of the settlement. PAS ultimately paid $352,400,000 for CIC's stock and PepsiCo paid an additional $50,000,000 as part of the settlement...

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>UK's lifeboat service accused of becoming a <span style="color:#FF0040">'taxi service for people traffickers'</span><br>
Lifeboats have been going into French waters to pick up migrants in dinghies<br>
RNLI donations have gone from around £7,000 a day to £200,000 last week<br>
Some have cancelled their direct debits and compared it to 'woke' National Trust<br>
<br>
The RNLI is having to delay other rescue work because of the number of migrants it is now picking up in the Channel, it was claimed today.<br>
<br>
It came as some supporters stopped giving cash because lifeboats are heading into French waters to pick up migrants and the charity has been spending millions of pounds abroad including <span style="color:#FF0040">buying burkinis for children in Africa and funding nursery places in Bangladesh.</span> ..<br>
<br>
Britain's lifeboat service has been accused of becoming a 'taxi service for people traffickers’ after it was revealed teams were going into French waters to pick up refugees in dinghies.   ..<br>
<br>
..Mark Dowie (left), RNLI chief executive, said he felt compelled to comment after volunteers reported being heckled for bringing migrants to safety. The RNLI brought in Dr Philip Goodwin (right), a green charity boss, to drive the British charity's work abroad ..<br>
<br>
Britain's lifeboat service sends around two per cent of all donations outside of the UK on a wide number of projects in Africa and Asia including buying burkinis for Muslim women in Africa and setting up creches in south Asia...<br>
<br>
...And the Isle of Man Government is giving £57,855 to support the RNLI's work in Bangladesh where it has a project teaching children to swim.<br>
<br>
In 2016, the charity announced it was providing training to Greek, German, Dutch and Swedish organisations to help save migrants crossing from Turkey to Greece.
