Government Officials Know the Final Fate of Busloads of Immigrant Children That Go Missing<br>
<br>
Fox 10 anchor, Kari Lake.  Because “I could not keep telling the public stories that were not true”.<br>
<br>
The accounts that you are about to read will never appear in the controlled media, therefore, to most ignorant Americans, this cannot possibly be true.<br>
<br>
<br>
For 7 years, I have received highly reliable information from a DEA officer. In the last Central Am immigration invasion, Obama was busy trying to “rescue” immigrant children by loading them on buses and sending them to communities that would have nothing to do with them as they were rejected. Whatever happened to these children?<br>
<br>
Today, bus loads of children are experiencing the same fate .  What happens to these children? Why is it that their so-called Catholic church sponsors and supporters never seem to be involved in the final distribution of these children? It is almost as if these children disappear in a puff of smoke. <br>
<br>
With regard to my communications with a DEA official and two Border Patrol personnel, we have different flavors of immigrants. First, there are the garden variety immigrants that are paraded in front of the media. These are people that genuinely want a fair chance at life. They are the ones that mow our lawns and bus our tables. They frequently live the hard life of a first generation immigrant in order that their children will enjoy the fruits of their sacrifice. These people pose no threat of violence or terrorism. However, their unregulated presence puts a definitive strain on the education system, welfare system, free health care system and critical infrastructure costs through the increased volume of usage.<br>
<br>
The next group of migrants constitute the reason that the present administration is refusing any media coverage of the border because they don’t want the public to see 15 Cuban males of fighting age arrested as they travel together across the border. We are also seeing Chinese, Turks, Iranians et al. crossing our Southern border. We know from previous reports that most of these interlopers are headed to areas with pre-stored weapons caches and are awaiting their final orders. They are soldiers and nothing else. The CSS has previously documented the assistance and allegiances that this group has formed with Antifa.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What about the children? Where do these missing children, refused by many American communities end up? I have learned through the years that a select few end up being “pimped out” by State-run Child Protective Services to homes with known sex-traffickers. This practice has opened a can of worms due to the exposure of these children to the extreme ancillary threats experienced by young people forced into sex trafficking. The whole issue came within an eyelash of being fully exposed to the public in Arizona. And in Arizona,high-ranking government officials are directly and indirectly involved in child-sex-trafficking and the coverup of the practice.<br>
<br>
<br>
In 2019, in Arizona, I covered a story regarding the selling of babies from mothers who were brought from the Marshall Islands by an Arizona public servant. Maricopa County Assessor Paul Petersen was arrested on charges of running an illegal international adoption scheme in three states. Petersen is faced 62 criminal charges for bringing pregnant women from the Marshall Islands to Arizona to give birth and then selling their babies in Utah, Arizona and Arkansas. The women were kept in homes in the East Valley of Phoenix until they gave birth and the babies were sold to would-be-parents. Some of the children just ended up missing. Where could they have gone?<br>
<br>
None of the news reports touched upon several critical issues. How does a public servant, making $70,000 per year afford "bondage houses" and transport and delivery servies? How did the mothers get to the United States from the Marshall Islands? Who was paying for the homes that the mothers were staying in until they gave birth? Who was paying for the medical services to deliver these children? Where would this "public servant" find medical staff competent enough to deliver the children, but criminal enough to participate in what they had to know was a massive international crime ring? Further, how did one public servant with a middle income salary pull this off by himself? Paul Peterson, according to the FBI, local authorities and the local media has no accomplices. This story, on its face is not even believable. In fact, what we have here is a Jeffrey Epstein operation which is probably connected to the Clinton Foundation and this case has complete been missed by the CPS of Arizona.  And what happened in this case that was a media sensation for a week? The investigation was abruptly stopped and Peterson, when one considers the heinous aspects of this case, received a proverbial slap on the wrist and his governmental cohorts, escaped with their freedom and reputations intact. But wait, it gets worse.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also in 2019, Arizona State Senator Farnsworth filed a report with the Depart of Public Safety (DPS). He went as far as to call the police because he reported that fellow State Senator Kate Brophy McGee threatened him if he did not stop investigating the siphoning off of Arizona foster children to a global sex-trafficking ring and this, in part is exactly what the Peterson case is about. <br>
<br>
Many people I have spoken with tell me about a man named McKay who was appointed by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey to clean up the mess at CPS. Instead, McKay ordered agents to seize more children and even more kids disappeared. The Phoenix New Times talks about how Ducey has changed his name from Roscoe to Ducey, to conceal his family's organized crime background from Ohio. What's interesting is that Ducey appointed Peterson to his present position. We know that Trump was relentless in pursuing justice for victimized children. Is this why Ducey blocked the investigation into alleged election fraud by suspect voting machines in Maricopa County when he refused to convene a special session, at the request of the State Senate to investigate voter fraud?<br>
<br>
the Phoenix New Times, once ran a story on the late John McCain.  his first wife was disfigured from an automobile crash. McCain divorced her and married Cindy Hensley (McCain). The New Times went on to expose that the Hensley family was an organized crime family with a history dating back to bootlegging during Prohibition. It was their money that funded the political rise of John McCain. Governor Doug Ducey was once an employee of the Hensley business, Hmmm, I would have to be a dedicated coincidence theorist to not see these connections.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The person who Farnsworth alleges threatened him, Kate Brophy McGee is on the Legislative committee overseeing CPS activities. What a coincidence! Here is another set of coincidences. McKay is not only tied to Ducey (ie friends), he is also associated with ex-senator Jeff Flake, the late John McCain and amazingly, Mitt Romney in their "never-Trumper movement and Romney is someone who I have implicated for his subtle threats against of President Trump. In fact, all of these men are tied together by Urkranian business interests according to one anonymous source. This explains a lot because this also brings the Bidens into the equation by association as well as Nancy Pelosi's son. These events are currently under investigation by the CSS and others as I have learned. Think, Bidens-Ukraine-China. This should answer a lot of questions about what we are now seeing, and not seeing in the media.<br>
<br>
These Ukranian associations, I am told, go a lot further than illicit energy deals (eg Burisma) and get directly into the realm of child-sex-trafficking. Trump has made the stopping of this practice a priority and this explains the wrath from this group that he is feeling.  From the comments made by Tulsi Gabbard to Hillary Clinton, I believe that it is highly likely that Gabbard has this same information that is just coming to light. There is no question that the Arizona CPS fiasco is an Epstein operation and many of Arizona's politicians, in key positions, are complicit. This is an ongoing story and more will be forthcoming.<br>
<br>
These associations explain a lot about the Ukrainian impeachment fiasco. The Democrats are masters at accusing others of what it is there guilty of. For example, the Russian-Collusion-Delusion, I believe the evidence speaks to this, was about covering up the Clinton Foundation's Uranium One fiasco of selling highly enriched uranium to the Russians and this deal involved Robert Mueller as I conclusively proved in July of 2017. Amazingly, Trump was impeached for the Ukraine fiasco and beneath it all are the child-sex trafficking exploits of key Arizona politicians, both past and present and the Peterson case highlights these connections.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is another point to consider and that is how widespread this practice is and just how deadly it is to those would dare intervene.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of people who were close to the Clinton Foundation and child-sex-trafficking allegations. Running parallel to the Clinton Foundation are various child-sex-trafficking allegations connected to various Child Protective Services (CPS). Here is the list of murder<br>
