<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
RACINE – Former Racine Mayor John Dickert was found not guilty of misdemeanor disorderly conduct by a Racine County District Court jury Wednesday. The charge was in connection with a fistfight between Dickert and another man in a Mount Pleasant grocery store parking lot. The jury began deliberation at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday and returned with the verdict shortly before noon.<br>
<br>
Dickert, 58, and Christian Reynoso, now 20 of Racine, were charged by the Racine County District Attorney’s Office with disorderly conduct. As a result of a reported fight outside Malicki’s Piggly Wiggly, 5201 Washington Ave., on March 22, 2020. The Mount Pleasant Police investigated the report.<br>
<br>
Misdemeanor disorderly conduct is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and 90 days in jail.<br>
<br>
Reynoso’s Testimony<br>
<br>
Reynoso stated that he was driving to work “in a hurry and driving fast” when he observed another man driving and videotaping him. The man was later identified as Dickert. Reynoso then pulled into the store parking lot and next to Dickert’s vehicle. Then, Reynoso said that he asked Dickert why he was recording him. Reynoso stated that Dickert got out of his car, approached Reynoso’s passenger side window, and leaned on the car. After Dickert walked around to the driver’s side, he stated, “something to the effect of ‘do you think you’re a tough guy?’” Reynoso then began to step out of his car, and Dickert grabbed him by the neck/throat area and pushed him. Reynoso said he responded by punching Dickert. He stated that Dickert also punched him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dickert served as Racine mayor from 2009 to 2017. He resigned in July 2017 to become executive director of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative. He left that position in 2019 to be an administrator with the Wisconsin Department of Revenue.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>DanODonnellShow outlines how Supreme Court candidate Lisa Neubauer has used a loophole to get around rules prohibiting political donations and give massive amounts of money to Democrats. ..<br>
<br>
One of her very first jobs was as a legislative aide to Democratic State Senator Fred Risser. She married Democratic State Assembly member Jeffrey Neubauer, who later served as chairman of both the Wisconsin Democratic Party and Democratic President Bill Clinton’s campaign in Wisconsin...According to Wisconsin Campaign Finance Information System (CFIS) records, $27,490 of that was in the name of Lisa Neubauer–including eight separate donations totaling $8,100 to former Democratic Governor Jim Doyle. A little over a year after the last of those donations, Doyle appointed her to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals even though she had no prior judicial experience. Four months after the appointment, her husband Jeffrey donated an additional $250 to Doyle and then gave him a further $500 in 2009...<br>
<br>
On September 19th, Jeffrey Neubauer made a $5,000 donation to then-gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers. On November 5th, he donated another $5,000. How likely is it that he donated $10,000 in two months without telling his wife or without his wife agreeing to an expenditure that large in such a short period of time? It’s about as likely as either a Governor Tony Evers policy or Governor Tony Evers himself never ending up in a case before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  ..<br>
<br>
If the party is the State of Wisconsin, its lawyer very well may be Attorney General Josh Kaul. On June 4th, Jeffrey Neubauer donated $500 to his campaign. On October 21st, he donated another $1,000.  <br>
<br>
..This is especially pertinent given Judge Neubauer’s decade-long refusal to list on her mandatory ethics reporting form customers of her husband’s former business, Kranz, Inc. As a result, it is nearly impossible to determine whether she would have had a conflict of interest in literally hundreds of cases that have come before her; cases in which her and her husband’s financial interest could have been directly impacted...</div></blockquote>
