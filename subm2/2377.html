			<div class="content">From <em class="text-italics">The Dictator's Handbook: Why bad behavior is almost always good politics</em> by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita.  A MUST READ if you want to understand the truth behind politics and how it <em class="text-italics">really </em>works.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In this chapter we explore five questions about foreign aid.<span style="color:#FF8000"> Who gives aid to whom? How much do they give? Why do they give it? What are the political and economic consequences of aid? And what do the answers to these questions teach us about nation building?</span><br>
For any who were starting to think of democrats [in this context, democrats refers to democratic leaders or politicians] as the good guys, this will serve as a wakeup call. <span style="color:#FF40FF">Most of us would like to believe that foreign aid is about helping impoverished people.</span> The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the primary organization for allocating US aid, advertises itself as "extending a helping hand to those people overseas struggling to make a better life, recover from a disaster or striving to live in a free and democratic country. It is this caring that stands as a hallmark of the United States around the world." Making the world a better place for its inhabitants is a laudable goal for donors. Yet the people in recipient nations often develop a hatred for the donor. And recipient governments (and donors too) often have different views about what the money should be for. As we will see, democrats are constrained by their big coalition to do the right thing at home. However, these very domestic constraints can lead them to exploit the peoples of other nations almost without mercy. </div></blockquote>


<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF40FF">Heart-wrenching images of starving children are a surefire way to stimulate aid donations</span>. Since the technology to store grain has been known since the time of the pharaohs, <span style="color:#FF40FF">we cannot help but wonder why the children of North Africa remain vulnerable to famine.</span> A possible explanation lies in the observations of Ryszard Kapuscinski. Writing about the court of the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, Kapuscinski describes its response to efforts by aid agencies to assist millions of Ethiopians affected by drought and famine in 1972: <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Suddenly reports came in that those overseas benefactors who had taken upon themselves the trouble of feeding our ever-insatiable people had rebelled and were suspending shipments because our Finance Minister, Mr. Yelma Deresa, wanting to enrich the Imperial treasury, had ordered the benefactors to pay high customs fees on the aid. "You want to help?" the minister asked. "Please do, but you must pay." And they said, "What do you mean, pay? We give help! And we're supposed to pay?" "Yes," says the minister, "those are the regulations. Do you want to help in such a way that our Empire gains nothing by it?"</em><br>
  <br>
The antics of the Ethiopian government should perhaps come as little surprise.<span style="color:#FFBF00"> Autocrats need money to pay their coalition</span>. Haile Selassie, although temporarily displaced by Italy's invasion in the 1930s, held the throne from 1930 until overcome by decrepitude in 1974. As a long-term, successful autocrat, Selassie knew not to put the needs of the people above the wants of his essential supporters. To continue with Kapuscinski's description:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">First of all, death from hunger had existed in our Empire for hundreds of years, an everyday, natural thing, and it never occurred to anyone to make any noise about it. Drought would come and the earth would dry up, the cattle would drop dead, the peasants would starve. Ordinary, in accordance with the laws of nature and the eternal order of things. Since this was eternal and normal, none of the dignitaries would dare to bother His Most Exalted Highness with the news that in such and such a province a given person had died of hunger.... So how were we to know that there was unusual hunger up north? </em><br>
  <br>
<strong class="text-strong">Selassie fed his supporters first and himself second; the starving masses had to wait their turn, which might never come</strong>.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Many of us remember Live Aid, a series of records and concerts organized by Bob Geldof to raise disaster relief. Unfortunately, as well intentioned as these efforts were, much of the aid fell under the influence of the government. For instance, trucks meant for delivering aid were requisitioned to forcibly move people into collective farms all around the country. Perhaps 100,000 people died in these relocations.<br>
<br>
There is no shortage of similar instances, where aid is misappropriated and misdirected by the recipient governments. To take just one prominent example,<span style="color:#FF0040"> the United States gave Pakistan $6.6 billion in military aid to combat the Taliban between 2001 and 2008. Only $500 million is estimated to have ever reached the army. Nevertheless, aid continues to flow into Pakistani coffers. Given the stated goals of aid agencies, once it becomes clear that money is being stolen, one would expect them to stop giving. Alas, they do not.</span></div></blockquote>

Remember the millions sent to "empower women" in Pakistan? Pakistan has one of the best intelligence services in the world.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> If you remember, Sergeant Doe of Liberia received over $500 million from the United States during his decade in power. And the United States got a lot in return: <br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
"We [US] were getting fabulous support from him on international issues. He never wavered [in] his support for us against Libya and Iran. He was somebody we had to live with. We didn't feel that he was such a monster that we couldn't deal with him. All our interests were impeccably protected by Doe."</em><br>
<br>
With the end of the cold war, the United States had much less need for Doe's support. Only then did it find its moral scruples. In 1989 it published a report, which we quoted earlier but is nonetheless worth repeating: <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">[Liberia] was managed with far greater priority given to short-term political survival and deal-making than to any long-term recovery or nation-building efforts.... The President's primary concern is for political and physical survival. His priorities are very different from and inconsistent with economic recovery . . . President Doe has great allegiance to his tribes people and inner circle. His support of local groups on ill designed projects undercut larger social objectives. </em><br>
  <br>
The truth is, foreign aid deals have a logic of their own. Aid is decidedly not given primarily to alleviate poverty or misery; it is given to make the constituents in donor states better off. Aid's failure to eliminate poverty has not been a result of donors giving too little money to help the world's poor. Rather, the right amount of aid is given to achieve its purpose <span style="color:#00FF00">"improving the welfare of the donor's constituents so that they want to reelect their incumbent leadership."</span></div></blockquote></div>
