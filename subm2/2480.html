			<div class="content">So, this is a continuation of a series of comments I left on <em class="text-italics">McMartin cover up - important context found on Voat</em> by Heisenberg123 <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2472" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2472</a> where I was looking at at Gallery Elena Shchukina London. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paris has also been a featured artist with Gallery Elena Shchukina in Mayfair and <span style="color:#FFFF40">Unit London, Soho, London</span>.</div></blockquote> ​<br>
<br>
Gallery Elena Schukina  is an established Russian owned elite art gallery whereas Unit London Soho was started by a couple of millennials with no money but 'innovation and the internet' , so the fable goes. I thought I'd take a closer look at Unit.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Joe Kennedy and Jonny Burt have found that a different approach can pay dividends. Only 27, and in business for less than four years, the old school friends run Unit London, a large gallery in the centre of Soho, and represent 12 artists, regularly selling their works for £20,000 to £30,000 and sometimes as much as £100,000.</em> reports the Times. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/instagram-artists-create-a-stir-and-a-business-model-ct7gtv9j7" class="postlink">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/inst ... -ct7gtv9j7</a><br>
<br>
Those two are suddenly everywhere and with no apparent financial backing.. within 4 years they are now ensconced at a premiere London address in Hanover Square <a href="https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/joe-kennedy-jonny-burt-interview-2019-tastemakers/" class="postlink">https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/ar ... stemakers/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Unit London is a contemporary art gallery in Mayfair’s Hanover Square, counting Vogue House and Sotheby’s as neighbours. 
</div></blockquote>

None of the many articles on these two give any background information on Joe Kennedy and Jonny Burt .. However, an image search produces..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Georgia made her big break at the tender age of 10 years old by landing the role of Fiona in Tim Burtons cult film of 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children', in partnership with Twentieth Century Fox.<br>
<br>
Following the success of the film, other theatre credits include the lead role of Blousey Brown In 'Bugsy Malone' at the Lyric Hammersmith, directed by Sean Holmes in 2016.<br>
<br>
2017 saw Georgia originate the role of 'Pandora Brathwaite' in 'the secret Diary of Adrian Mole age 13 3/4' at the Munier chocolate factory directed by Luke Shepherd' Following this she can be heard on the original cast recording of T'he Secret Diary of Adrian Mole' that was released in 2018.<br>
<br>
Georgia is represented in the UK by Frances Stevenson and Jessica Jackson at <span style="color:#FFFF40">Curtis Brown Offices</span>.</div></blockquote>

In 2001, the international satellite market was fully commercialized, and the US predominant role in INTELSAT was fully privatized after 2001 as Intelsat was formed up as a private Luxembourg corporation.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The fall in value of the Jerusalem based TV software solutions company, which was acquired by Cisco in 2012 for $5 billion, is due to changing consumer TV habits.<br>
Private equity fund Permira has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cisco’s Service Provider Video Software Solutions (SPVSS) business (formerly known as NDS). Following completion of the deal, Permira Fund will create a new, rebranded company focused on developing and delivering video solutions for the Pay-TV industry.<br>
<br>
No financial details were disclosed but sources close to the deal say that Permira will be paying Cisco about $1 billion. The deal ends an unprofitable chapter for Cisco, which acquired NDS from Permira and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in 2012 for $5 billion. Changes in the way people consume television have contributed to NDS's fall in value as the Jerusalem based company's customers are traditional cable and satellite TV providers.<br>
<br>
Video industry leader Dr. Abe Peled, former chairman and CEO of NDS and adviser to the Permira Funds, will serve as chairman of the new company. The sale of the Cisco SPVSS business has been approved by Cisco’s board of directors.<br>
<br>
The new company will encompass a broad portfolio, including Cisco’s Infinite Video Platform, cloud digital video recording, video processing, video security, video middleware, and services groups.<br>
<br>

Rethinking global cooperation and business values will be at the heart of talks at the 40th World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos next week, say WEF executives.<br>
<br>
The annual five-day brainstorming, which opens on January 27 in the eastern Swiss mountain resort, is due to attract 2,500 participants from more than 90 countries. Haiti and global warming will also be top agenda items.<br>
<br>
World leaders and business figures will be meeting under the motto “Improve the State of the World: Rethink, Redesign, Rebuild” to take stock in the aftermath of the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0040">His Royal Highness Crown Prince Haakon</span> is in Davos attending the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting. The forum is celebrating its 40th anniversary with a call to action: “Improve the State of the World: Rethink, Redesign, Rebuild”..<br>
<br>
Later in the week Crown Prince Haakon will take part in the group discussion “Values in Your Everyday Life”, and will serve as a one of the Discussion Leaders of the concluding session “The Global Agenda 2010: The View from Davos” on the meeting’s closing day...<br>
<br>
The Crown Prince is attending the Annual Meeting in his role as a Young Global Leader. The Forum of Young Global Leaders (YGL) comprises leaders under the age of 40 and is the most important voice for young people in the World Economic Forum. The Crown Prince first attended the meeting in Davos in 2005.<br>
<br>
During the past year, Crown Prince Haakon has been responsible for coordinating the YGL’s efforts under the Global Redesign Initiative...<br>
<br>
In all, 3,000 experts and leaders have contributed their input to the Global Redesign process. The YGL’s activities, led by the Crown Prince, have focused on generating ideas within six areas: Values, Governance, Education &amp; Youth, Health, Sustainability &amp; Environment, and Strengthening Economies.<br>
<br>
Concrete initiatives under development include:<br>
<br>
The YGL Global Business Oath – an oath for business people modelled on the Hippocratic Oath.
<ul><li>Deworm the World – a project that provided treatment to 12 million children in 2009 alone.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Global Dignity – an initiative launched by the Crown Prince and two other co-founders that has to date promoted dialogue on dignity among young people in over 30 countries.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Table for Two – a mechanism for alleviating hunger. Every time you eat a healthy “Table for Two” meal at a participating company cafeteria or restaurant, a small contribution is donated to fund a school meal in a country suffering from hunger.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Promoting Democratic Values – articulating and sharing best practices.</li></ul>

On Thursday, 28 January, the Crown Prince will participate in a panel debate in his capacity as Chair of the YGL Global Redesign Task Force. The session will be moderated by <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#FF0040">Lord Mark Malloch-Brown</span></span>, former Administrator of UNDP and former UK Minister of State with responsibility for Africa, Asia and the UN.<br>
