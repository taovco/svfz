			<div class="content">Y'all can skip my ramblings and just give advice or congratulations if you'd like.<br>
<br>
Guess who's going to be a zoomer dad in ~ 9 months? I feel old, my only hope is y'all feel older.<br>
<br>
I found this article and it surprisingly seemed mostly right: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/arch" class="postlink">https://www.theatlantic.com/family/arch</a> ... ts/618172/<br>
It essentially boils down to children are smaller, dumber adults. Once they can walk and talk they should be helping around the house, and you being the wiser bigger adult should act like it and not stoop to their level. Your job is not to coddle your kids but make it so they become mature adults. This is pretty close to what John Rosemond recommended back in the day. It goes on to say it takes more than two parents to raise a family (multiple generations &gt; nuclear family), however it falls short by saying school teachers are equal to the parents.<br>
<br>
I think I can figure out how to raise a boy, have him help out but don't breathe down his neck, let him try to fix his own problems, be honest with him. Mrs. T-bitty probably knows how to raise a girl however I'm admittedly more worried about that with the amount of degeneracy targeted at women. Anyone know how to raise a daughter to be a lady instead of a whore? No Kikeflix obviously.<br>
<br>
I've seen a lot of people recommend homeschooling here and it does make sense, however I know of people homeschooled their whole lives who became degenerates when they hit 19. Plus where I live it's kind of expected to have your kids in school, even if the teachers are retards. I figure I need some way to let my kids experience the real world without being sucked in by it or being murdered by it. I was thinking maybe homeschooling them until junior high or something.<br>
<br>
Anyway, anyone got advice?</div>

			<div class="content">A hearty congratulations to you. I have this. I hope others can add to it or point to where I’m wrong.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%">Development</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Prenatal</span><br>
Without summarizing a whole nutritional, psychological, and skill training session for parents, which are all necessary knowledge bases before and during pregnancy, let us begin shortly before birth. The mother should eat many dark green vegetables and carrots, as well as meats, eggs, fish, and dairy. In the first stages of labour, it is important to be stretching, moving, and having a support group to reduce stress levels. This is when, sometimes prompted by question/information, the mother will be offered pain treatment. A strong pain-reducing procedure now commonly used in all births–especially necessary for a C-section–is an epidural. This is when a flexible tube is injected at the base of the back to the spine to release powerful, generally localized drugs to midsection and lower body. This procedure is necessarily followed by increased monitoring of the mother for the following reasons: Oxytoxin release will be altered, so a more synthetic approach is taken brand names of syntocinon and pitocin, and a synthetic delivery of oxytocin is given. Instead of being localized to the vagina and uterus, oxytocin is now body-wide in much higher doses than normally released, to make up for the general delivery. The mother-child bond is affected. The drugs given also affect the newborn because they are begun several hours prior to birth and much goes through the blood.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Birth</span><br>
You should strictly make sure–ahead of time–that all doctors and nurses involved are aware you do not want circumcision. Get it in writing as a legal document. This is particularly important in American hospitals so that no one says, “No worries; no charge for you!” They will be forceful. You want delayed umbilical cord clamping. The standard is to clamp it immediately once the baby has come out. Ensure that all doctors and nurses involved know–long before the final moments–that you want delayed clamping, with the child immediately on the mother’s breast.<br>
<br>
K1 injections are standard. You do not want to increase pain or trauma to the newborn. There are oral options if you’re convinced you need some K1/K2 for your child. The mother eating enough vitamin K (5mg-15mg during breastfeeding) will also increase amount of K in the breastmilk. There will be options to give antibacterial ointment for eyes and other topical procedures. These are also not needed, but are standard unless you refuse. There will be a multitude of vaccines that will vary slightly based on location. You can get all modern vaccines without thimerosal (mercury compound) and without any other preservatives. They will then usually come single shot per vaccine. Flu vaccines are absolutely unnecessary and have been shown to cause miscarriages. The flu virus mutates much too rapidly for effective prevention of current spreading strains. There is always more than one strain in the public. In short, just keep people with flu symptoms away from child and mother for some weeks after birth, regardless of if anyone involved has had shots. They are also recommended several times a year throughout childhood development. Refuse them all. There is no reason to use “formula” for the child. If the mother absolutely cannot breastfeed, schedule a wet nurse as you near the end of the third trimester. Keep a breastfeeding supply available and limitless for the child. Sometimes premilking and using bottles is okay, but maximum time with the mother is recommended–especially the first year to 18 months. Your child hears, sees, and learns quickly. You want interaction from the mother and the father–or, in case of the father performing duty away from home, another masculine family figure like an uncle or grandpa.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">1-4</span><br>
Your child will pick up language and emotions. If you speak more than two languages or know a native speaker of another language you want to introduce to the child before they reach adulthood, you’ll want to spend several hours a week speaking audibly in that language near the mother and child–even before birth. You want to ensure you articulate words and speak proper sentences to your child. Make sure no one wastes precious learning time by making idiotic baby noises. The child imitates parents and others around it, not the other way around. It is trying to learn words as the brain rapidly reorganizes (there are many synapses, lost after birth, which help augment learning). Don’t spend endless money on clothes that fit the infant for a month or two only. Hold them often and never ignore the cry of a young infant. Never exhibit stress or show extreme negative emotions near the child. If you need to vent your stress, or you notice a heated argument oncoming, do not do it in the earshot of the child. Detailed nutrition knowledge will be omitted, but never forget the importance of the foods you eat and drink. Sweets other than fruit should be avoided, and it’s better if they’re not introduced at all. Foods like honey, fully natural jams, and natural (no sugar added) peanut butter are more than sweet enough for your child.<br>
<br>
They should learn how to play with others, how to organize, how to act in public, and how to put on a “mask” instead of showing their true selves, which is essential otherwise we eat each other. This is the beginning of acting civilized. Without learning these basic things, your child will always be a savage who throws tantrums, screams, bites, and is essentially a liberal. Most liberals are damaged in this stage in their lives, either by divorcing parents or some other reason. As the child ages several years and you have them walking and using a variety of words, talk to them often. They may not be able to understand everything you tell them or really respond. They are still listening. Speak honestly with them and encourage logic and reason when approaching problems. Children will naturally do that, so foster it. Attempting to use your authority as an adult as the only answer and the single rule for everything is not right. It won’t help them learn and trust their own decisions and thoughts.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">4-8</span><br>
Here’s when they learn how other people work and test this out in a simulated environment (playing house). They will test how far they can push someone before they respond (annoying). “Why does person A like person B?” “How can I get someone to like me?” “How does this group of people fit together?” Overtly instruct your children about this. Help them watch people and explain to them why people act the ways they do. Children can be manageable in this stage, as long as you continually feed them information. If they get bored or isolated in this stage, they will go nuts. They need to watch adults! The earliest cartoons can become very useful here if you pick them right, such as the Grimm classics. Don’t try to sterilize everything. Let your kids be in the outdoors, supervised closely–both before they can walk on their own and especially after. You will notice your child is not only able to learn quickly, but is gaining physical coordination rapidly after age 4. You will have been reading to them often and spending time talking with them, not just to them by this age. They can learn to read and write on their own long before the age of 6.<br>
<br>
By 6-8, it is time to advance their science and history knowledge considerably. Remember to keep lessons short, fun, and visually enhanced with a variety of tools. They should get a primer on ecology, a good amount of lessons in mathematics, and then on to chemistry, physics, and biology. If you keep them away from random MSM before this age, history lessons should be easy. No need to relearn–just learn the facts. You will start with the foundation of your country. If you are lucky enough to live where your ancestors have lived (Europe, etc.), then that will do. Otherwise, consider starting with a brief overview of that area first. Make it fun, make it short. When questions pop up, you can go into small lessons on the details there. Emphasize work ethic above all else. That is the foundation upon which everything is accomplished.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">8-12</span><br>
The pre-pubertal age. They test what they learned in the previous years and try to play the adult game by acting civilized. Obviously if they didn’t learn anything, they’re going to be ruffians and bitches. Girls tend to be very manageable at this age, boys don’t–they’re biologically different and thus have a different development path. Have them start reading books about families and social situations. At 8 or 9, your child should have a solid grasp on basic science concepts. Encouraged them to do all simple math in their heads. Let them have some lessons where they choose what to learn, with your assistance. Depending on your child, they could be capable of learning unattended for short periods. What is short? 15-20 minutes of reading is short. There is no reason a child should be forced to spend more than that sitting and reading unless they love it. This is when you sexually segregate your children’s education.<br>
<br>
Will it be the same for boys and girls? In sciences, the answer should be yes. For the average child, only very rudimentary concepts of science will have been taught to them at this stage. There is much more to learn before the advanced sciences. History can now be taught both into prehistory (where written records are few to none) and with detail. Ask questions such as “How could this isolated regional battle, development, or innovation affect distant regions, weeks or years later?” Then follow up with some facts that show what the answer happens to be. If there is a discrepancy between expectations and actual events, discuss this. Education is the foundation of the mind. Help your children get all the knowledge they seek. Read with them. Discuss what they learn. Share in the excitement they show. How fantastic a time this can be!<br>
<br>
Nutrition should be not just foods given now, but information on why certain foods are eaten and why some types of foods are minimized. “Why are most modern foods avoided as often as possible?” How do you deal with disobedience and punishment? At this age, your child should be capable of rational thought and understanding to a surprising degree. Physical punishment should be reserved, but with some children it will be used sparsely as needed. Never strike in anger. Never attempt to teach by inflicting pain. It will only distance you. How about sexual education? How young do you start? Should they know human reproduction on the cellular level at this early period? Get them engaged in things outside of the house. Enroll them in art classes, music, sports, dance (ballet, or ballroom when they’re older) martial arts, whatever interests them. This is where they get to socialize with others their age and get exposed to the outside world, with all its negative influences.<br>
<br>
Foster discussion with your children. Always be open and honest with them. They’re reaching adolescence and will interact with the outside world without your supervision more often. You want to talk about these experiences at every opportunity. Someone told your child that Santa Clause is real and you disapprove? Talk about it. Someone insisted your child should believe in fairy tales and they do not? Talk about it. Young humans are smarter than society gives them credit. Before puberty, you’ll have given your child lessons for life. They may not have understood them fully when given, but you will have taught them well so that they remember.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">13-16</span><br>
Here their hormones start to awaken. They want to mate, but aren’t physically ready. To fathers: your girls will test their seduction skills on you and any other male they trust. It’s important to let them do it (obviously draw boundaries). At this age, they’re trying to see–by experiment–how far they can push a man “in the wild” before he snaps and lashes out at them. Your girls will do stupid things to you just to see if you get mad. It’s important to get mad when you would with a girlfriend. If you get mad too soon, your daughter will be a pushover who gets used by any worthless male. If you get mad too late, your daughter will be a crazy bitch and a loose whore. This is why women without fathers in the house tend to push boyfriends too far and get themselves murdered, or don’t push them at all and the men are poor fathers.<br>
<br>
By 18, your daughters are essentially fully developed. The only thing they will lack is experience. Focus her on academics (especially politics) and home economics. Teach her how to survive in the world during the time she has no guy to look out for her, since it’s currently socially unacceptable for girls to keep living with their parents until they’re courted by a man. Due to the societal weakness of men–physically and emotionally, she should look into a self defense course and basic urban SERE training so she can escape gangs of roving nonwhites in the West. From 18 to 25, the male brain continues to develop. Long ago, this is when men would have their own trades or work at a business for someone else. Today, well…</div>

			<div class="content">Wonderful news! Big congratulations to you and the Mrs!!<br>
<br>
Her hormones are going to make her crazy. Just roll with the punches.<br>
<br>
Invite both your moms to the birth. It's amazing having them there and fulfilling for you all. Pay attention in lamaze class. <br>
<br>
Get a good top dollar breast milk pump and FoodSaver. She feeds baby from one breast and pump the other. It will hurt like hell but worth it. Freeze the milk for down the road in good vacuum sealed FoodSaver bags. Milk can dry up if she should get sick, so you'll have a stash. Plus you and grandmas can still feed baby that best breast milk.<br>
<br>
Speak normally, no baby talk. Read, read, read to him. When he's a decent reader, turn the book upside down, it explodes the neural pathways.<br>
<br>
You and Mrs. T will experience a level of love you never thought possible.<br>
<br>
And early on, you'll be so so very tired. Let moms and aunts and uncles watch baby while you nap. Seriously. And let them clean your house if they offer, it was one of the best gifts. <br>
<br>
Gripe water for colick. Add baby flaked rice or oatmeal to bottle breast milk after a few months and you'll all sleep through the night. Start buying diapers now, and buy all sizes. You'll do this with shoes and clothes later on, buy the next half size up, she'll wake one day with crazy growing body. Buy new shoes but buy resale baby and kids clothes.<br>
<br>
Don't forget to care for each other. Go on dates or walks alone as grandma watches the baby, even if it's just for an hour.<br>
<br>
As stressful as things can get with a baby, and it will, never forget you've brought an amazing new life into this world. <br>
<br>
You made that. <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

A hearty congratulations to you. I have this. I hope others can add to it or point to where I’m wrong.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%">Development</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Prenatal</span><br>
Without summarizing a whole nutritional, psychological, and skill training session for parents, which are all necessary knowledge bases before and during pregnancy, let us begin shortly before birth. The mother should eat many dark green vegetables and carrots, as well as meats, eggs, fish, and dairy. In the first stages of labour, it is important to be stretching, moving, and having a support group to reduce stress levels. This is when, sometimes prompted by question/information, the mother will be offered pain treatment. A strong pain-reducing procedure now commonly used in all births–especially necessary for a C-section–is an epidural. This is when a flexible tube is injected at the base of the back to the spine to release powerful, generally localized drugs to midsection and lower body. This procedure is necessarily followed by increased monitoring of the mother for the following reasons: Oxytoxin release will be altered, so a more synthetic approach is taken brand names of syntocinon and pitocin, and a synthetic delivery of oxytocin is given. Instead of being localized to the vagina and uterus, oxytocin is now body-wide in much higher doses than normally released, to make up for the general delivery. The mother-child bond is affected. The drugs given also affect the newborn because they are begun several hours prior to birth and much goes through the blood.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Birth</span><br>
You should strictly make sure–ahead of time–that all doctors and nurses involved are aware you do not want circumcision. Get it in writing as a legal document. This is particularly important in American hospitals so that no one says, “No worries; no charge for you!” They will be forceful. You want delayed umbilical cord clamping. The standard is to clamp it immediately once the baby has come out. Ensure that all doctors and nurses involved know–long before the final moments–that you want delayed clamping, with the child immediately on the mother’s breast.<br>
<br>
K1 injections are standard. You do not want to increase pain or trauma to the newborn. There are oral options if you’re convinced you need some K1/K2 for your child. The mother eating enough vitamin K (5mg-15mg during breastfeeding) will also increase amount of K in the breastmilk. There will be options to give antibacterial ointment for eyes and other topical procedures. These are also not needed, but are standard unless you refuse. There will be a multitude of vaccines that will vary slightly based on location. You can get all modern vaccines without thimerosal (mercury compound) and without any other preservatives. They will then usually come single shot per vaccine. Flu vaccines are absolutely unnecessary and have been shown to cause miscarriages. The flu virus mutates much too rapidly for effective prevention of current spreading strains. There is always more than one strain in the public. In short, just keep people with flu symptoms away from child and mother for some weeks after birth, regardless of if anyone involved has had shots. They are also recommended several times a year throughout childhood development. Refuse them all. There is no reason to use “formula” for the child. If the mother absolutely cannot breastfeed, schedule a wet nurse as you near the end of the third trimester. Keep a breastfeeding supply available and limitless for the child. Sometimes premilking and using bottles is okay, but maximum time with the mother is recommended–especially the first year to 18 months. Your child hears, sees, and learns quickly. You want interaction from the mother and the father–or, in case of the father performing duty away from home, another masculine family figure like an uncle or grandpa.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">1-4</span><br>
Your child will pick up language and emotions. If you speak more than two languages or know a native speaker of another language you want to introduce to the child before they reach adulthood, you’ll want to spend several hours a week speaking audibly in that language near the mother and child–even before birth. You want to ensure you articulate words and speak proper sentences to your child. Make sure no one wastes precious learning time by making idiotic baby noises. The child imitates parents and others around it, not the other way around. It is trying to learn words as the brain rapidly reorganizes (there are many synapses, lost after birth, which help augment learning). Don’t spend endless money on clothes that fit the infant for a month or two only. Hold them often and never ignore the cry of a young infant. Never exhibit stress or show extreme negative emotions near the child. If you need to vent your stress, or you notice a heated argument oncoming, do not do it in the earshot of the child. Detailed nutrition knowledge will be omitted, but never forget the importance of the foods you eat and drink. Sweets other than fruit should be avoided, and it’s better if they’re not introduced at all. Foods like honey, fully natural jams, and natural (no sugar added) peanut butter are more than sweet enough for your child.<br>
<br>
They should learn how to play with others, how to organize, how to act in public, and how to put on a “mask” instead of showing their true selves, which is essential otherwise we eat each other. This is the beginning of acting civilized. Without learning these basic things, your child will always be a savage who throws tantrums, screams, bites, and is essentially a liberal. Most liberals are damaged in this stage in their lives, either by divorcing parents or some other reason. As the child ages several years and you have them walking and using a variety of words, talk to them often. They may not be able to understand everything you tell them or really respond. They are still listening. Speak honestly with them and encourage logic and reason when approaching problems. Children will naturally do that, so foster it. Attempting to use your authority as an adult as the only answer and the single rule for everything is not right. It won’t help them learn and trust their own decisions and thoughts.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">4-8</span><br>
Here’s when they learn how other people work and test this out in a simulated environment (playing house). They will test how far they can push someone before they respond (annoying). “Why does person A like person B?” “How can I get someone to like me?” “How does this group of people fit together?” Overtly instruct your children about this. Help them watch people and explain to them why people act the ways they do. Children can be manageable in this stage, as long as you continually feed them information. If they get bored or isolated in this stage, they will go nuts. They need to watch adults! The earliest cartoons can become very useful here if you pick them right, such as the Grimm classics. Don’t try to sterilize everything. Let your kids be in the outdoors, supervised closely–both before they can walk on their own and especially after. You will notice your child is not only able to learn quickly, but is gaining physical coordination rapidly after age 4. You will have been reading to them often and spending time talking with them, not just to them by this age. They can learn to read and write on their own long before the age of 6.<br>
<br>
By 6-8, it is time to advance their science and history knowledge considerably. Remember to keep lessons short, fun, and visually enhanced with a variety of tools. They should get a primer on ecology, a good amount of lessons in mathematics, and then on to chemistry, physics, and biology. If you keep them away from random MSM before this age, history lessons should be easy. No need to relearn–just learn the facts. You will start with the foundation of your country. If you are lucky enough to live where your ancestors have lived (Europe, etc.), then that will do. Otherwise, consider starting with a brief overview of that area first. Make it fun, make it short. When questions pop up, you can go into small lessons on the details there. Emphasize work ethic above all else. That is the foundation upon which everything is accomplished.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">8-12</span><br>
The pre-pubertal age. They test what they learned in the previous years and try to play the adult game by acting civilized. Obviously if they didn’t learn anything, they’re going to be ruffians and bitches. Girls tend to be very manageable at this age, boys don’t–they’re biologically different and thus have a different development path. Have them start reading books about families and social situations. At 8 or 9, your child should have a solid grasp on basic science concepts. Encouraged them to do all simple math in their heads. Let them have some lessons where they choose what to learn, with your assistance. Depending on your child, they could be capable of learning unattended for short periods. What is short? 15-20 minutes of reading is short. There is no reason a child should be forced to spend more than that sitting and reading unless they love it. This is when you sexually segregate your children’s education.<br>
<br>
Will it be the same for boys and girls? In sciences, the answer should be yes. For the average child, only very rudimentary concepts of science will have been taught to them at this stage. There is much more to learn before the advanced sciences. History can now be taught both into prehistory (where written records are few to none) and with detail. Ask questions such as “How could this isolated regional battle, development, or innovation affect distant regions, weeks or years later?” Then follow up with some facts that show what the answer happens to be. If there is a discrepancy between expectations and actual events, discuss this. Education is the foundation of the mind. Help your children get all the knowledge they seek. Read with them. Discuss what they learn. Share in the excitement they show. How fantastic a time this can be!<br>
<br>
Nutrition should be not just foods given now, but information on why certain foods are eaten and why some types of foods are minimized. “Why are most modern foods avoided as often as possible?” How do you deal with disobedience and punishment? At this age, your child should be capable of rational thought and understanding to a surprising degree. Physical punishment should be reserved, but with some children it will be used sparsely as needed. Never strike in anger. Never attempt to teach by inflicting pain. It will only distance you. How about sexual education? How young do you start? Should they know human reproduction on the cellular level at this early period? Get them engaged in things outside of the house. Enroll them in art classes, music, sports, dance (ballet, or ballroom when they’re older) martial arts, whatever interests them. This is where they get to socialize with others their age and get exposed to the outside world, with all its negative influences.<br>
<br>
Foster discussion with your children. Always be open and honest with them. They’re reaching adolescence and will interact with the outside world without your supervision more often. You want to talk about these experiences at every opportunity. Someone told your child that Santa Clause is real and you disapprove? Talk about it. Someone insisted your child should believe in fairy tales and they do not? Talk about it. Young humans are smarter than society gives them credit. Before puberty, you’ll have given your child lessons for life. They may not have understood them fully when given, but you will have taught them well so that they remember.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">13-16</span><br>
Here their hormones start to awaken. They want to mate, but aren’t physically ready. To fathers: your girls will test their seduction skills on you and any other male they trust. It’s important to let them do it (obviously draw boundaries). At this age, they’re trying to see–by experiment–how far they can push a man “in the wild” before he snaps and lashes out at them. Your girls will do stupid things to you just to see if you get mad. It’s important to get mad when you would with a girlfriend. If you get mad too soon, your daughter will be a pushover who gets used by any worthless male. If you get mad too late, your daughter will be a crazy bitch and a loose whore. This is why women without fathers in the house tend to push boyfriends too far and get themselves murdered, or don’t push them at all and the men are poor fathers.<br>
<br>
By 18, your daughters are essentially fully developed. The only thing they will lack is experience. Focus her on academics (especially politics) and home economics. Teach her how to survive in the world during the time she has no guy to look out for her, since it’s currently socially unacceptable for girls to keep living with their parents until they’re courted by a man. Due to the societal weakness of men–physically and emotionally, she should look into a self defense course and basic urban SERE training so she can escape gangs of roving nonwhites in the West. From 18 to 25, the male brain continues to develop. Long ago, this is when men would have their own trades or work at a business for someone else. Today, well…
</div></blockquote>

Thank you Tallest, I will be saving all this advice. Neither the Mrs nor myself have much of a sweet tooth so no sugar shouldn't be a problem. I can definitely find self defense courses however finding a SERE course might be harder, although if all else fails I have friends who can teach some things I'm sure.</div>

			<div class="content">Congrats! I am going to copy and paste some advice I’ve given women to avoid forced c sections. Worded for women to read but you should be aware of all this as well as share it with her. Doctors might try to force surgery for something like the baby being breech or the fetal heart monitor spooking them when those aren’t always accurate. Some doctors do c sections because it’s just convenient for them, or they want the extra money. No matter the situation surgery is always a woman’s choice legally but doctors don’t always respect that. Here it is:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Keep your phone charged and with you at all times, at your side at the hospital. Bring a charger. Record on your phone, there are voice recorder apps that run in the background. Call police if you have to.<br>
2. Don't sign consent forms for the surgery if you don't want it, even if they yell at you and make it seem like the only way out of the room is to sign them. I tried to sign using my maiden name to trick them into letting me out of the room since I was supposed to use my real name but it wasn't enough for a lawyer to help me, and once I signed it no one else in the hospital cared I was yelling for them not to. If you refuse to sign they can get in trouble, they don't want to be sued. <br>
3. Use legal terms with them. Yelling at someone, saying they need to sign consent forms and have no choice is called consent under duress*. Refusing medical treatment while being aware of the risks is called informed refusal. If you want to leave ask to sign an AMA form (against medical advice form) so the doctors won't be liable for letting you leave under their care, that way they won't panic about possibly getting sued. <br>
4. Bring up the American College of Gynecology's view on forced medical treatment, which you can find here: <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2016/06/refusal-of-medically-recommended-treatment-during-pregnancy" class="postlink">https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical- ... -pregnancy</a><br>
5. Have someone with you at all times, don't let them leave your room. Have them bring food and drink, if they smoke ask them use a nicotine patch or nicotine gum. If you're not allowed to have someone in your room, or want extra people just in case then have a video chat going. Discuss your concerns and the legal terms with them so they can call for help if they need to. <br>
6. I'm not 100% sure on this one but have heard you can ask for a hep lock/j loop IV instead of being attached to the IV stand. That way you can move around easier during labor/birth which is a good excuse to ask for it, but it'll also allow you to walk out of the hospital if you need to. I didn't walk out because I was stuck to an IV. An epidural would get you stuck too but I wouldn't recommend those anyway. When I had my first baby I had an epidural and it fell out when I started pushing and damaged the nerves in my back. I told some mom friends I have and a few of them said they had nerve damage from an epidural too, apparently that's pretty common. <br>
*definition of duress: threats, violence, constraints, or other action brought to bear on someone to do something against their will or better judgment<br>
I hope I didn't freak you out. Having a baby is worth the risks, and now that you have this information you'll be able to protect your wife. If I'd known all this I'm pretty sure I could have avoided being forced into surgery. That hospital took advantage of me because I didn't know how to handle the situation.</div>

Y'all can skip my ramblings and just give advice or congratulations if you'd like.<br>
<br>
Guess who's going to be a zoomer dad in ~ 9 months? I feel old, my only hope is y'all feel older.<br>
<br>
I found this article and it surprisingly seemed mostly right: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/arch" class="postlink">https://www.theatlantic.com/family/arch</a> ... ts/618172/<br>
It essentially boils down to children are smaller, dumber adults. Once they can walk and talk they should be helping around the house, and you being the wiser bigger adult should act like it and not stoop to their level. Your job is not to coddle your kids but make it so they become mature adults. This is pretty close to what John Rosemond recommended back in the day. It goes on to say it takes more than two parents to raise a family (multiple generations &gt; nuclear family), however it falls short by saying school teachers are equal to the parents.<br>
<br>
I think I can figure out how to raise a boy, have him help out but don't breathe down his neck, let him try to fix his own problems, be honest with him. Mrs. T-bitty probably knows how to raise a girl however I'm admittedly more worried about that with the amount of degeneracy targeted at women. Anyone know how to raise a daughter to be a lady instead of a whore? No Kikeflix obviously.<br>
<br>
I've seen a lot of people recommend homeschooling here and it does make sense, however I know of people homeschooled their whole lives who became degenerates when they hit 19. Plus where I live it's kind of expected to have your kids in school, even if the teachers are retards. I figure I need some way to let my kids experience the real world without being sucked in by it or being murdered by it. I was thinking maybe homeschooling them until junior high or something.<br>
<br>
Anyway, anyone got advice?
</div></blockquote>

<br>
The major thing for a parent is to pay attention and occasionally participate to what is happening with their kids lives so if you do see a problem you can help them. So just show them love, attention and honesty about your worries.<br>
However maybe I'm being alarmist but I feel there's a big issue right now with gangs, drugs, sex and money in the west and that culturally we've regressed to were civilization is barely holding on.</div>

			<div class="content">Ok,sure. Make sure you feed them the most natural diet possible. If you can grow your own,that's best,but as purely natural as you can. And yes,teachers are equal to parents in responsibility to your kids. Very few teachers will live up to that responsibility and will gladly teach your child whatever the jews tell them to. They don't care if it's bullshit. Good teachers are a godsend. So make sure you got responsible teachers. If they show signs of laziness or bullshit you with stuff like "It's part of the curriculum tho" even if they know it's bullshit,get 'em a better school if you can. Also,bare in mind that curriculums only change if enough parents make noise. They could be asking you for help. School is good for learning social skills,but in the end,if you don't want 'em socializing with certain people,home schooling is the way to go. <br>
<br>
Defence against degeneracy is a life long task. It's especially hard for girls cause there's always thirsty assholes who will do and say anything to get that pussy. See male feminists. As such,you should probably teach your daughter that any guy can come up and promise the moon and stars and then pump and dump. So it's probably best to treat all comers as pump and dumpers. Meaning,if she's gonna whore out,she should get all she can out of it. Cause he might be leaving after the orgasm. But the best case scenario is always getting married before you have sex cause if he decides to leave then,she can take half his shit. But she should only marry a guy she can stand to be around. Either party leaving the marriage means you both fucked up,tho.<br>
<br>
The reason a lot of home schoolers go full degenerate when they turn 19 is they're now out in the world without mom or dad telling them what to do. So they immediately start doing what their new degenerate friends do. Don't raise your kids in a bubble. Tell them about the degeneracy and why it's bad. Keeping your kids from evil only works so long as they stay away from evil all their lives. If they come in contact with evil and don't know what it is,they're much more likely to fall for it's tricks. You gotta teach kids the world does have rainbows and kittens and lollipops but it also has rapists,murderers,and thieves as well as jews who are all three. So yeah,tell them what they're gonna be up against and you'll be doing them a great service.</div>

The major thing for a parent is to pay attention and occasionally participate to what is happening with their kids lives so if you do see a problem you can help them. So just show them love, attention and honesty about your worries.<br>
However maybe I'm being alarmist but I feel there's a big issue right now with gangs, drugs, sex and money in the west and that culturally we've regressed to were civilization is barely holding on.
</div></blockquote>
Sounds good. The West is dying if not already dead, I'm just, perhaps naively, hoping it hangs on a little bit longer.</div>

Ok,sure. Make sure you feed them the most natural diet possible. If you can grow your own,that's best,but as purely natural as you can. And yes,teachers are equal to parents in responsibility to your kids. Very few teachers will live up to that responsibility and will gladly teach your child whatever the jews tell them to. They don't care if it's bullshit. Good teachers are a godsend. So make sure you got responsible teachers. If they show signs of laziness or bullshit you with stuff like "It's part of the curriculum tho" even if they know it's bullshit,get 'em a better school if you can. Also,bare in mind that curriculums only change if enough parents make noise. They could be asking you for help. School is good for learning social skills,but in the end,if you don't want 'em socializing with certain people,home schooling is the way to go. <br>
<br>
Defence against degeneracy is a life long task. It's especially hard for girls cause there's always thirsty assholes who will do and say anything to get that pussy. See male feminists. As such,you should probably teach your daughter that any guy can come up and promise the moon and stars and then pump and dump. So it's probably best to treat all comers as pump and dumpers. Meaning,if she's gonna whore out,she should get all she can out of it. Cause he might be leaving after the orgasm. But the best case scenario is always getting married before you have sex cause if he decides to leave then,she can take half his shit. But she should only marry a guy she can stand to be around. Either party leaving the marriage means you both fucked up,tho.<br>
<br>
The reason a lot of home schoolers go full degenerate when they turn 19 is they're now out in the world without mom or dad telling them what to do. So they immediately start doing what their new degenerate friends do. Don't raise your kids in a bubble. Tell them about the degeneracy and why it's bad. Keeping your kids from evil only works so long as they stay away from evil all their lives. If they come in contact with evil and don't know what it is,they're much more likely to fall for it's tricks. You gotta teach kids the world does have rainbows and kittens and lollipops but it also has rapists,murderers,and thieves as well as jews who are all three. So yeah,tell them what they're gonna be up against and you'll be doing them a great service.
</div></blockquote>

The article referred to teachers as complete equals to parents, not just in regards to responsibility. Good advice, and sounds like logical advice although I will hopefully teach my daughter not to be a whore. Definitely though, I can't shield them from reality forever, the difficulty seems to be how to effectively teach them about all the scum bags in the world, without getting them too close to them.</div>

			<div class="content">Congratulations! I hope the pregnancy goes well and you get a healthy boy or a girl.<br>
<br>
Since you asked for advice, as someone who recently became a dad (a bit over a year ago and I also worked with a department for obstetrics for a few years so I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly sides of pregnancies), here are a few things to keep in mind:<br>
- remind your wife to take iron and other supplements which fetus requires for healthy development<br>
- wait at least until week 22-24 (viable pregnancy) before you get your hopes high<br>
- if she feels something is odd or discomfort etc., don't hesitate to visit your obstetrician. Better safe than sorry.<br>
<br>
First trimester:<br>
- in case of increased NT, make sure to get a NIPT to confirm<br>
- only go for invasive diagnostics if both NT and NIPT point to issues (a friend lost a pregnancy this way)<br>
<br>
Second trimester and onwards:<br>
- don't get your hopes high until you clear organ screening (every organ is examined thoroughly for development issues via US)<br>
- ask your OB-GYN for for DICOM files of your Ultrasound (don't just take JPEGs), both CINE and stills<br>
- once born, monitor your baby for bilirubin issues for the first few weeks<br>
- and finally, don't worry too much about it, your instincts will kick in once the baby is born and you'll be on autopilot<br>
- make sure to get some sleep whenever your wife/baby is sleeping, nights will be long for the first few months<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
p.s. yes, this is really me. Hi!</div>

			<div class="content">Congratulations! Use search voat or searx for links and further reading, I've posted most of this before.<br>
<br>
Prenatal:<br>
<br>
Ultrasounds are good for spotting problems, which can be vital to know (in my case if I didn't do any my 2nd would have died but we were prepared and had a plan). I recommend the 20 week scan as the first one unless you really have no idea about date. Before 20 weeks they are pretty useless and after same after unless an issue is spotted. There is not a lot of evidence they are safe and some that they cause harm. Keep them short and by a professional on a calibrated machine and don't let them linger the wand on the belly in-between images (when they are typing notes etc), a really good tech will do this without you asking. Do not get those fucking novelty ultrasounds, they are usually done by novices or unqualified people.<br>
<br>
Take good quality prenatal vitamins with folate not folic acid. I really like Garden of Life MyKind Organic 3 a day prenatal vitamins, I did a lot of research and they were the best but they don't have omega 3 so I used their vegan omega 3 as well - don't use a fish based one! Too much mercury.<br>
<br>
Don't drink fluoride water - get reverse osmosis filter or buy purified. <br>
<br>
Exercise is important- look up videos of prenatal exercise or get her to join a class where a trainer or physio can correct her techniques. Practice birthing positions too.<br>
<br>
Talk to your care provider but after 37 weeks it is generally safe to collect colostrum into a syringe by hand, do it! It is gold and excellent for immunity and you only get 2-4 days post birth of it. There is a chance it can start labour but it is only small.<br>
<br>
Drink Raspberry leaf tea or take the capsual version of it in the third trimester to make labour easier.<br>
<br>
Vitamin K is only in minuscule amounts in breastmilk but can be supplied to and stored by the baby pre-birth, so eat foods high in VitK and/or supplement.<br>
<br>
Birth:<br>
<br>
Watch Rikki Lake's The Business Of Being Born and the sequel to it. <br>
Read Ina May Gaskins Guide To ChildBirth. <br>
<br>
Midwives are way better than OBs in general and Doulas are an excellent addition if you can afford one.<br>
<br>
Homebirth is superior to hospital unless there is an actual medical problem with mum or baby.<br>
<br>
Get gold, frankincense and myrrh. The gifts were not for Jesus but Mary. Gold is a "push present"  and frankincense and myrrh oils on a cloth or in a diffuser to inhale or in a carrier oil to rub into the belly skin in labour to help contractions, pain, healing and blood loss. Lavender goes with the other oils and smells lovely and is good for calming which is important. Clary sage smells foul but is great for speeding up and bringing on labour. Use on a cloth that can be removed do not diffuse lol!<br>
<br>
Birth upright or on all fours or maybe side lying, do not let people encourage or force her on her back!<br>
<br>
Delayed cord clamping in hospitals usually means anything other than instant or 30-60 seconds. WAIT FOR WHITE! You want the cord to finish pulsating and turn white, which is usually around 5 minutes. In an emergency is can be milked to speed this time up. A baby doesn't need to breathe if the cord is attached and pulsating. Resus can be done with the cord attached if needed.<br>
<br>
Baby on to mums chest and undisturbed for an hour at least if possible before weighing and measuring. Unless baby is covered in poo do not wipe or wash off the vernix (cheese varnish) rubbing in is okay, leave it a few days or a week if you can.<br>
<br>
Breast is best. Most mums can breastfeed, but it's not easy for many. Baby and mum both need to learn this skill! Baby led attachment is a good place to start. Lactation consultants can help. Baby only has a tiny stomach and unless premmy lots of fat stores to tide them over while learning, and they will lose weight. Avoid supplementing before mums milk has come in unless dire as it will lead to breastfeeding problems. If supplements are needed breast is best so if the hospital won't give you donor milk and there isn't a milk bank nearby there are dedicated websites and Facebook groups where you can buy or have breastmilk donated- or ask a nursing mother you know to donate or wet nurse! If you must use formula do not use fluoridated water to make it. Also use glass bottles with silicone teats.<br>
<br>
Australian Breastfeeding Association is the best resource. Fenugreek supplements are amazing but "boobie bickies" (AKA Lactation Cookies) and oats with a side drink of milo is pretty awesome too. She needs to drink lots of water. 3.8 litres a day is ideal.<br>
<br>
Baby/Toddler:<br>
<br>
Everyone says babies have delicate skin and can get sunburnt easy and you shouldn't use sunscreen on them - all true but newborns especially need direct sunlight, just not large amounts of it or middle of the day in summer, great for jaundice. <br>
<br>
Babies are just small stupid humans, but not as stupid as many people think. Talk to baby almost constantly, they understand more than you realise and the more you talk the more they understand. Tell them everything you will do to them before you do it and as you are doing it narrate what is happening. Mum and baby have a sort of psychic connection for a while that should be nurtured. Look up Dunstan Baby language, the 5 minute Oprah clip will do. Print or write up the words and put them on your wall.<br>
<br>
Do 'Elimination Communication', Go Diaper Free is a great resource. It is basically potty learning from birth, you can and should use a diaper until they are walking or reliable with the potty. Saves poosplosions/poonamis, diapers and headaches when they are toddlers.<br>
<br>
Do not use chemical filled nappies like Huggies. Use cotton or hemp cloth diapers in classic or modern style (Fitted is the best modern style - Sandys by Mother Ease) and a wool cover (Polish brand Puppi is amazing but hand knitted is good enough) or an eco brand of disposables but some ecos are much better than others and there are fake eco brands too.<br>
<br>
Read up on Montessori and RIE methods of parenting styles. Stefan Molyneaux has some great parenting advice. Gentle or Peaceful Parenting are good search terms, as is Secure Attachment. Read The Whole Brain Child by Dan Seigil ?spelling?)<br>
<br>
Baby wearing or holding baby is better than a pram and other containers but important to make sure baby gets a lot of floor time. A lot of tummy time in the early months can be while you or mum are reclined or laying down with baby on chest.<br>
<br>
I have more advice but that is all I can think of right now.<br>
<br>
Edit: Colic and SIDS are both lies for "I don't know why baby is crying/ died" babies do not cry without reason and very rarely die without a discernible reason. Vaccines, smoking, drinking and drugs and obestity are linked with most SIDS and co-sleeping deaths. Colic medications contain shit like alcohol and chloroform and it's not always listed on the bottle. Elimination Communication reduces crying just like changing wet diapers, feeding, putting to sleep, holding them, rocking or swinging them, swaddling them, making sure they are not too hot or cold or in pain (check for things like insect bites or hairs wrapped around toes or fingers, or ill fitting garments). Sometimes babies don't know why they are sad or are just sad because they are out of the comfort of the womb and they just need comfort while they cry. Never let a baby cry alone unless you want to shake it and noone else can take over.<br>
<br>
Do not add food like oats to bottles it is a choking hazard. Do not sleep train, babies wake at night, it is normal, deal with it. Co sleeping bassinets or bed sharing (with the Safe 7!) Can help.<br>
<br>
Baby Led Weaning is the best way but food before one is just for fun. There are heaps of guides but mainly you will need to learn first aid for choking whatever weaning you do (BLW, traditional or mixed) Purees should be spoon fed not sucked from a pouch or bottle to avoid choking and teach chewing. Learn the difference between choking and gagging and generally don't help if they are gagging. Do not start food before 6 months unless on medical advice. Avoid rice baby cereals. Just powder oats in a grinder and mix with breastmilk ideally to make porridge.</div>

			<div class="content">My kiddo is 14.  Here are some mistakes I wish I had not made.  1.  Do not vaccinate.  2.  Do not use formula if you can avoid it and if you cannot; DO NOT use soy formula.  3.  Do not snip (if him).  4.  Television: none.  5.  Real food; no cereal, chips, candy, soda etc.  So far I do not feel I have failed him on the intellectual side; but I made some mistakes in not protecting him from environmental hazards.  If only I knew then what I know now.</div>
