Isabelle Paul, head of the Order of Saint John in Florida, and her husband lived in Cincinnati (and she also supports the Mayo Clinic).

They were part of the group known as the Merry Pranksters.  Isn't that just another name for the Royal Order of Jesters?  I'm just asking...<br>

One Legendary Party: The Hell’s Angels and the Merry Pranksters Meet at Kesey’s <a href="https://electrickoolaidblogtest.wordpress.com/2013/07/07/hells-angels-merry-pranksters-party-at-ken-keseys-1965/" class="postlink">https://electrickoolaidblogtest.wordpre ... seys-1965/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For the last six years or so, one party has been haunting me. It wasn’t any soiree I’d attended—this party took place on Saturday August 7, 1965 at Ken Kesey’s LSD-laced ranch in La Honda, California. ..What made this party special wasn’t its mix of intellectuals—poet Allen Ginsberg and Harvard psychology professor Richard Alpert (aka Baba Ram Dass) among them—and countercultural icons such as Hunter S. Thompson and Neal Cassady; it was the 15-foot-long, red white and blue sign strung up outside the ranch: THE MERRY PRANKSTERS WELCOME THE HELL’S ANGELS.<br>
<br>
.....Rosenfeld points out that this party—during which the tie-dyed psychedelic community and the swastika-sporting motorcycle gang effectively coexisted without any fatalities—came only two months before the Angels gave an unequivocal beatdown to a members of the Vietnam Day Committee (VDC) as they attempted to peacefully march into Oakland in protest of the war. The parade was led by “a chanting, cymbal-clanging Ginsberg,” but all the ohms in the world weren’t going to stop the Angels, whom the FBI allegedly allowed to commence attacking protesters before police intervened. Rosenfeld reports that it took a subsequent LSD-fueled meeting between Ginsberg, Kesey, and Hell’s Angels leader Sonny Barger to get the Angels off the VDC’s back.<br>
<br>
Given this, and the subsequent tensions with the VDC, it seems odd that the Hell’s Angels/Merry Pranksters party at La Honda is portrayed as such a celebratory event—particularly in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. Coming across the party in Subversives inspired me to take a closer look back at other accounts of the event. One aspect stood out like a sore thumb: the portrayals (or nonportrayals) of an alleged gang rape that took place at the party...
</div></blockquote>

The description in the article of a gang 'rape' of a young woman who was said to be a willing participant sounded more like a ritualistic event. In addition, the Pranksters and the Hell's Angels both provided services for Woodstock which ended in that 1969 debacle with the Rolling Stones and was said to herald the end of the Sixties . I'm almost completely convinced that the pranksters are jesters.. so I went looking...<br>

A University of Cincinnati article on billikens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121103222828/https://www.uc.edu/news/billiken.htm" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20121103222 ... lliken.htm</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>UC won't even be playing Saint Louis until Jan. 22 and Feb. 12, but already the campus has been besieged by billikens. You can thank assistant professor of geography Wendy Eisner for that. She has a passion for billikens - with a small "b," the tiny good luck imps from which the college sports team took its name in 1911. Her curiosity has nothing to do with basketball and everything to do with geography and the quirky little figures that define what became a popular culture item nearly 100 years ago. ..<br>
<br>
The key event spreading the billiken phenomenon to Alaskan territory seems to have been the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle in 1909, when billikens served as the expo's "patron saint," Eisner theorizes. "From there they relocated to Nome." ..In  Alaska, billiken popularity never really disappeared as it did on the mainland. In fact Eisner first stumbled upon billikens on a research trip to the Arctic in the early 1990s. She tends to travel to northern Alaska twice a year, most recently to research thaw lake basins. She is working to gain a greater understanding of the influence of climate on the evolution of these lake basins and on the possible effects if these basins are adversely affected by global warming. <br>
<br>
..Eisner also theorizes there might be a connection between billikens and two other figurines she came across. If you don't like toilet humor, stop reading now. Both figures show boys on the toilet - one says "Billy Can" and the other, "Billy Can't," with accompanying facial expressions. Given as carnival prizes, the statuettes probably predate the first Chicago billiken, so Eisner wonders if the woman who designed the first billikens modeled them after the Billy Can/Can't. </div></blockquote>

So, where did the word theater come from? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_theatre" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_theatre</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The history of theatre charts the development of theatre over the past 2,500 years. While performative elements are present in every society, it is customary to acknowledge a distinction between theatre as an art form and entertainment and theatrical or performative elements in other activities. The history of theatre is primarily concerned with the origin and subsequent development of the theatre as an autonomous activity. Since classical Athens in the 6th century BC, vibrant traditions of theatre have flourished in cultures across the world..<br>
<br>
Theatre arose as <span style="color:#FF0040">a performance of ritual activities that did not require initiation on the part of the spectator.</span> This similarity of early theatre to ritual is negatively attested by Aristotle, who in his Poetics defined theatre in contrast to the performances of sacred mysteries: theatre did not require the spectator to fast, drink the kykeon, or march in a procession; however t<span style="color:#FF0040">heatre did resemble the sacred mysteries in the sense that it brought purification and healing to the spectator by means of a vision, the theama</span>. The physical location of such performances was accordingly named theatron</div></blockquote>

Sacred mysteries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_mysteries" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_mysteries</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sacred mysteries are the areas of supernatural phenomena associated with a divinity or a religious ideology. Sacred mysteries may be either:<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:1."> <li>Religious beliefs, rituals or practices which are kept secret from non-believers, or lower levels of believers, who have not had an initiation into the higher levels of belief (the concealed knowledge may be called esoteric).</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:2."> <li>Beliefs of the religion which are public knowledge but cannot be easily explained by normal rational or scientific means.</li></ul>

Although the term "mystery" is not often used in anthropology, access by initiation or rite of passage to otherwise secret beliefs is an extremely common feature of indigenous religions all over the world.<br>
<br>
A mystagogue or hierophant is a holder and teacher of secret knowledge in the former sense above. Whereas, mysticism may be defined as an area of philosophical or religious thought which focuses on mysteries in the latter sense above.</div></blockquote>

Stage School: What Is Theatre of the Absurd? <a href="https://www.theskinny.co.uk/theatre/opinion/theatre-of-the-absurd" class="postlink">https://www.theskinny.co.uk/theatre/opi ... the-absurd</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What is Theatre of the Absurd, and why does it speak to us? As a new production of <span style="color:#FF0040">Samuel Beckett's Endgame</span> by Citizens Theatre director Dominic Hill comes to theatres in 2016, we find out more about a genre that holds a mirror up to ourselves...<br>
<br>
Many of the European playwrights associated with the absurdist movement, including Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, and Jean Genet, rejected the phrase – which was coined by a critic – altogether. Rather, these men saw themselves as individual artists, not members of a collective, and viewed their plays as nothing more than an expression of their personal vision of the world.<br>
<br>
So if absurdist playwrights worked independently of each other, how did they produce plays that were so strangely similar in their rejection of the conventions of traditional theatre?<br>
<br>
It’s not a coincidence; it’s all in the timing.<br>
<br>
Where does absurdist theatre come from?<br>
Born from the ashes of postwar Europe, absurdist theatre reflects an era of spiritual emptiness, a time when the precariousness of human existence was palpable. Following the atrocities of World War Two, to some the world itself had become absurd: a frightening and illogical place in which life had lost all meaning and human existence seemed futile.<br>
<br>
The growing popularity of Existentialism in Europe (notably in Paris, where many of the absurdist playwrights lived as exiles), will also have been influential. The philosophy of Albert Camus, who is credited with first using the word absurd in this sense, certainly had a role to play in the creation of this kind of theatre...<br>
<br>
How does absurdism work?<br>
When absurdist plays first came to the stage, it was a groundbreaking moment in the history of theatre. Although an exciting and progressive movement, critics didn't know what to make of it and many were outraged. Even by today’s standards, absurdist plays flout all theatrical conventions; everything we know drama to be is turned on its head.<br>
<br>
For a start, the whole premise of a plot is subverted. A beginning, middle and end structure, which underpins all conventional narrative, is abandoned in favour of a non-linear – and often cyclical – approach, and there is a deliberate absence of the cause-and-effect relationship used to link scenes. The plays assume a dream-like state, operating in images rather than in coherent dialogue and action. All meaning remains ambiguous.</div></blockquote>

Wilfred Bion’s analysis of Samuel Becket <a href="https://100years.tavistockandportman.nhs.uk/timeline/wilfred-bions-analysis-of-samuel-becket/?v=79cba1185463" class="postlink">https://100years.tavistockandportman.nh ... cba1185463</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0040">Samuel Beckett was Wilfred Bion’s first case at the Tavistock Clinic</span>.<br>

<br>
The analysis, which began in 1934, was difficult, lasted for nearly two years and had a profound reciprocal influence on both men.<br>
<br>
Beckett had come to London for analysis, because it was illegal in Ireland at the time. He was a relatively young man with considerable anxiety, much of which had to do with his bad relationship with this mother.<br>
<br>
Both men were known to be difficult and intractable characters, but they respected each other and had a rapport.  A “psychic twinship” developed between them  that culminated in Bion famously inviting his patient to dinner and a lecture by Carl Jung.<br>

Beckett got through his writers block and emigrated to Paris where he began work on his most important series of novels. He made radical use of free association as a literary form in his novellas and his Trilogy,  before making his hugely creative transition from prose to drama and going on to win a Nobel Prize.<br>
<br>
Bion in turn, re-worked his clinical contact with Beckett, who became the ‘patient zero’ of his pioneering postmodern psychoanalytic clinical theories.<br>

...The jester is also depicted as The Fool, one of the 78 cards in a Tarot deck, which itself is similar in appearance to the Joker playing card.<br>
<br>
Strangely, jester-type entities commonly appear in the DMT experience. In DMT: The Spirit Molecule, many participants reported encountering “clowns”, “jesters”, “jokers”, and “imps” during their experiences with the substance. Many users report also describe these types of entities as ‘tricksters’. These entities are often engaged in elaborate and mind-boggling performances and tricks. The environment they inhabit can also reflect their entertaining nature, with many users finding themselves in strange dimensions that resemble a circus, carnival, or casino. In fact, <span style="color:#FF0040">Terence McKenna said that “the archetype of DMT is the circus”.</span></div></blockquote></div>

<br>
Here's our synopsis (if you're into that sort of thing): On a whim, Eve (young Swedish traveler) accepts an invitation from Peter (wealthy heir) to vacation on his family’s private island off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter and that something is not quite right on this mysterious island. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of her surroundings dissolves, and Eve finds herself trapped in an unstable reality punctuated by feverish visions, dimensional shifting and secret pizza.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As the purchaser for $575,000 of an elegant residence known as Long Acres, located in Indian Hill, Hamilton County, plaintiff Lawrence M. Paul sues the defendants (1) for removing and converting from the buildings and grounds certain items of property, (2) for damages resulting from failure to maintain the estate prior to delivery of possession as required by the purchase contract, and (3) for punitive damages.<br>
<br>
..When possession was delivered to plaintiff on January 15, 1972, he noticed that a number of items were missing that had been on the property both before and after the date of the purchase contract. The defendants admit that these items had been removed by the individual defendants before surrendering possession.<br>

The First National Bank of Cincinnati was duly appointed Executor of the Long Estate.<br>

The will left to the decedent's surviving children "all household furnishings, appliances, decoration and equipment owned by me and used in or about any principal or seasonal residence." (Emphasis added.) The real estate passed as part of the residue to The First National Bank of Cincinnati, as trustee under a 1969 Trust Agreement with the decedent. The four surviving children divided up the personal property among themselves as the result of three meetings, the first of which was held in January 1970, and the last of which was held in October or November 1971 (presumably after the closing of the sale). Each of the children now has one or more of the several items claimed by plaintiff to have been wrongfully removed and converted...<br>

I. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the following amounts from defendants Nancy L. Hogan, Dorothy L. Ward, Patricia L. Bonn and William A. Long, jointly and severally..</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It's been more than 40 years, but the events of Sept. 9, 1969, remain etched in the memories of many area residents.<br>
<br>
That day, Allegheny Airlines Flight 853, a DC-9 on its way to Indianapolis from Cincinnati, crashed in a Shelby County soybean field. The 78 passengers and four crew members on board died.<br>
<br>
Indianapolis pilot Robert Carey was in the other plane involved in the crash, a single-engine Piper Cherokee traveling south from Brookside airport near McCordsville to Columbus. The planes collided a half-mile in the air above London. County resident John Simpson was an aerial photographer for the Indiana National Guard stationed out of Stout Field in Indianapolis.<br>
<br>
"We made several passes over the site by helicopter, and I was amazed at the complete destruction," Simpson said.<br>
<br>
"Debris was everywhere, but it formed a definite pattern leading to the (nearby Shady Acres) trailer park. Some witnesses at the time said the jet pilot made a valiant effort to avoid the trailer park in the last seconds."..

<br>
Mr. Long, or "Gus", as he was known, was Vice-chairman of the Board of Colonial Food Stores, and former President of the Board of Directors of Albers Supermarkets. He had been married to Jeanette Albers until her death in 1951, and had five children by that marriage. All were adults by the time of the crash. In 1955, he married Polly. She was a musician, and performed with the local group Musica Sacra.

Flight 853:<br>
Boston - Baltimore - Cincinnati - Indy - St. Louis <a href="http://www.allegheny853.net/69story.htm" class="postlink">http://www.allegheny853.net/69story.htm</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Scheduled departure of Flight 853 from Boston was 1200. The crew reported at 1100. The flight was due to go first to Baltimore, then to Cincinnati, on to Indianapolis, and finally, to St. Louis. In Cincinnati, 64 people were waiting on TWA flight 69 from New York. It was due into CVG at 1445, but wasn't going to be on schedule. TWA offered its passengers the option of transferring to Allegheny 853, and 38 people took the offer. Therefore, with the delay while these passengers transferred, 853 was supposed to leave at 1457, but didn't leave until 1516. Flight 853 was scheduled to arrive in Indy at 1536. 26 passengers chose to stay behind and wait for TWA 69, which came in at 1545, half an hour after the Allegheny flight departed.<br>
<br>
The flight plan of the jet was to fly V97 at 390kt to the Shelbyville (IN) VOR at 10000'. (The airway V97 is defined between the Cincinnati and Shelbyville VORs, and is still in use today. It departs Cincinnati on a 306° heading, and arrives at SHB on a 304° heading. The distance between the two VORs is 64 nm.)<br>
<br>
..There was one family who was spared the full brunt of the tragedy. Mr. And Mrs. Darrell Hardesty of Linton, IN, had been ticketed aboard the ill-fated jet. They had been visiting their daughter in Fayetteville, NC, and were to return on Allegheny through Cincinnati on September 9. The couple were making their way to the airport that morning to catch their 8:00am flight in Fayetteville, only to see their plane taking off as they arrived at the airport. Apparently, some confusion over Daylight Savings Time had caused them to believe they still had an hour left before the flight would depart.

Saving The Daylight<br>

<span style="color:#FF0040">Benjamin Franklin conceived it. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle endorsed it. Winston Churchill campaigned for it. Kaiser Wilhelm first employed it. Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt went to war with it.</span> Every spring the clocks go forward, and every autumn they go back. Saving the Daylight explores for the first time the contentious, and often entertaining, story of this deceptively simple attempt to regulate the sunlight hours. Throughout its surprisingly controversial history, Daylight Saving Time has been claimed to have influenced a wide variety of areas, including agricultural practices, the reporting of sports scores, street crime, voter turnout and many other, sometimes unexpected aspects of daily life. The book brings together the historical, political and technical aspects of the fascinating story behind the movement for DST, with many light and offbeat anecdotes.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>William H. Albers, "Mr. Supermarket"<br>
<br>
Albers Hall, dedicated in 1929, is the gift of Mr. William H. Albers. In this building are the classrooms, laboratories, and offices of the departments of Biology, Military Science, and Physics, the administrative offices of the President, and the Director of Public Relations.<br>
<br>
William H. Albers<br>
<br>
Born in Cincinnati on May 23, 1880 to Henry and Anne Albers, William Henry Albers was educated at St. Joseph Parochial School and Hughes High School. He entered the grocery business by working as a clerk at his father’s market (1902), and later (1908) became associated with the Kroger Grocery and Baking Company. Albers married Caroline Plogman in 1902, and they had two daughters, Irene and Jeanette. His first wife died in 1908, and in 1913 he married Dorothy Brown of Chicago.<br>
<br>
In 1928, Albers became President of the Kroger chain and quickly started expanding the company. That same year, 138 Piggly Wiggly stores were acquired in Ohio and Kentucky, and 166 grocery stores were added from Michigan. By 1930 Kroger had expanded from 190 to 5600 stores. There were differences between Albers and the company’s Board of Directors however, so in 1930 Albers resigned.<br>
<br>
In 1933 he founded Albers Super Markets, Inc. The flagship store was located at 4500 Montgomery Road. <span style="color:#FF0040">It was the first grocery store to use the name ―supermarket</span> - and had many innovations as well as lower prices than independent grocers. This appealed to Depression era shoppers. Albers was the first chain to use florescent lighting and provide grocery carts for customers. Fully self service, with wide aisles, the stores had a variety of nationally recognized brands (rather than private label merchandise), which saved money for housewives. Albers stores were the first to price every item so customers could see exactly what the cost was. The grocery chain was a phenomenal success.<br>
<br>
William Albers was a civic minded citizen, and served the Community Chest, CYO, Xavier University Lay Advisory Committee, and Lay Committee on Scouting. He was awarded the Silver Beaver, Silver Antelope, and Silver Buffalo Awards by the Boy Scouts of America, and served on the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts for 11 years. He was active in the Mt. Alverno Home for Boys, and served on numerous food boards and supply control committees during World War II. He was a director of the Second National Bank, Board Chairman of Sperti, Inc., and a member of the Art Museum, Ohio Chamber of Commerce, the Historical and Philosophical Society, the Queen City Club, and the Camargo Club. He was a<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"> Knight Commander in the order of St. Gregory XVI</span></span>, a director of the National Council of Catholic Men, and the Cincinnati chapter of the Conference of Christians and Jews awarded him for his contributions to mutual understanding of peoples.<br>
<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Albers resided primarily in their majestic estate, Alberly Manor. Their home, at 9200<br>
<br>
Shawnee Run Road, was built between 1926 and 1928 in a stately English style. Situated on 100 acres, the Tudor house had an extraordinary slate roof and 23 rooms, several of which contained religious embellishments, including a chapel. On the grounds were two cottages, a detached garage, a 7 stall stable, tennis courts, a swimming pool, bath house, and 3 themed gardens. Mr. and Mrs. Albers hosted their housewarming party concurrent with their youngest daughter Jeanette’s debutante party in June 1927. The pleasant and gregarious couple invited guests to their estate for numerous charitable events and private parties.</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">I haven't read your entire post but would like to add as a side note to the mention of the Grateful Dead:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://archive.is/VqTyE" class="postlink">http://archive.is/VqTyE</a><br>
<br>
It is also notable that two individuals associated with the Grateful Dead were once employees of the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program – band member and lyricist Robert Hunter [xv], and author Ken Kesey[xvi] whose ‘Merry Pranksters’ were often at the Grateful Dead shows promoting LSD use to the ‘Deadheads’. Kesey’s novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest promoted the ‘archaic revival’ by concluding with a heroic American Indian escaping from modern tyranny and returning to a primitive culture. Furthermore, Grateful Dead song writer John Perry Barlow, in 2002, admitted in a Forbes magazine interview ironically titled “Why Spy?” that he spent time at CIA headquarters at Langley.[xvii]<br>
MK-ULTRA ran a number of its operations near Haight-Ashbury, the San Francisco district where LSD would become commonly used. Declassified CIA records show that there were at least three CIA ‘safe houses’ in the Bay Area where ‘experiments’ – the giving of LSD to unsuspecting citizens –&nbsp;went on. This subproject of MK-ULTRA was code-named “Operation Midnight Climax”. Chief among Operation Midnight Climax’s ‘safe houses’ was the one at 225 Chestnut on Telegraph Hill, which operated from 1955 to 1965.<br>
<br>
<br>
At the same time the Grateful Dead was promoting LSD use in San Francisco, another music drug counterculture scene with many suspicious connections to military intelligence began promoting the drug to the young people attending the music clubs on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. The counterculture scenes in LA and San Francisco were part of a larger whole that included Britain and New York. The media gave the new music drug culture almost unlimited exposure, which reached its zenith with Life magazine’s coverage of the Woodstock ‘music festival’. Although Life presented Woodstock as three days of ‘Love and Understanding’ it was in fact a culturally debased event – a true ‘archaic revival’ – that featured drugged teenagers fornicating in the mud while their rock idols provided encouraging background music.<br>

I've done posts on the co-option of counterculture. The  Electronic Frontier Foundation is another psyop.  As is the current 'freedom movement' we see globally against the COVID enforcers.  All managed by the hidden hands.<br>
<br>
The 'Well' is also a very important notion in terms of occult knowledge and witchcraft.  The term WELLbeing is being used to transform humanity.  I did a whole thing on Twitter before they deleted my account.  Basically, through the use of film, biotechnology and cyberspace they are using mystery schools and tribal knowledge against us.  I'm still exploring the intersections between these different fields to understand how and why they do it.  There is much to still unpack.<br>

Reminder 3 - Fog dryer is not trustworthy and has been attempting to cyberstalk, dox, infiltrate groups in Racine, spread disinformation and obfuscate The Truth. They share information in order to gain false credibility only to dox, threaten and turn others against those who know too much. They are not the only one doing this.<br>

Reminder 4 - A bad actor here on SearchVoat registered the name TrustTheTruth. Why and who could it be? We are TrustTheTruth and can verify as such.</div></blockquote>

No one registered your name, that's a lie. If you used your TTT account in the last week of Voat, you received a password for your acct. there in PM. If you didn't save that password, then you don't get the name on SVF. If you didn't use that acct., then you weren't issued a password. Why do you always make stuff up when you don't know shit? Liar<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Reminder 3 - Fog dryer is not trustworthy and has been attempting to cyberstalk, dox, infiltrate groups in Racine, spread disinformation and obfuscate The Truth. They share information in order to gain false credibility only to dox, threaten and turn others against those who know too much. They are not the only one doing this.</div></blockquote>

Why are you continually talking smack about other people? <br>

We did address the concerns with fogdryer directly.<br>
<br>
Fogdryer was infiltrating forums in Racine, and was proven to know nothing about Racine in his attempts to falsely gain trust from the community.<br>
<br>
Fogdryer has been proven to be untrustworthy, and you are not any different.<br>
<br>
You accuse others of the very actions you take.<br>
<br>
You never truly investigated anything about Racine, yet went out of your way to downvote and encourage censorship and banning.<br>
<br>
You used tactics like archiving to gain trust of others as you disparaged anyone sharing The Truth.<br>
<br>
These links below speak for themselves. Anyone trying to tell you that there is nothing to see in Racine is lying or obfuscating.<br>

			<div class="content">The Truth stands on its own. Did you archive any of the links or read any of the articles? Are they all “junk” mixed with “lies” or are you projecting?<br>
<br>
Go ahead and try to disprove any of these.<br>
<br>
Is the head of Shriners International not from Racine?<br>
<br>
Is the founder of Rotary International not from Racine?<br>
<br>
Is Brad Smith not the President of Microsoft and a key global advisor to Gates, Zuckerberg and the elite?<br>
<br>
Did Anna Makanju not put community organizing in Racine for George Soros on her resume?<br>
<br>
Did Joe Biden not personally endorse the Billion Dollar Referendum in Racine?<br>
<br>
Did Zuckerberg and CTCL not choose Racine as the head of the Famous Wisconsin Five to manipulate the election?<br>
<br>
You are puffing your chest. You are disparaging others. You are talking smack. Your handle is also “shewhomustbeobeyed”.<br>
<br>
Why did you show up in defense of Sryazie when she was outed as blackmailing users, lying, grifting and running multiple accounts?<br>
<br>
Who is Shizy and what is their relation to Srayzie?<br>
<br>
Why did you openly mock and celebrate the death of Jem777?<br>
<br>
Did you know that she denounced her relationship with George and vowed to “never trust him again” days before she died?<br>
<br>
Why did Voat really shut down?<br>
<br>
What did Vindicator have on his Twitter photo? Who is Vindicator? Where do they live?<br>
<br>
Do you Repent, denounce Satan, and believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord, Savior and the only son of God? Why not?</div>
