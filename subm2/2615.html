			<div class="content">In the following video this WHO whistleblower talks about the influence of Bill Gates at the WHO. That he has contracts with the WHO and member states. She also says that his huge influence on the international health scene really seems to have started around 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/ANKLLWX0DMQ" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/ANKLLWX0DMQ</a><br>

Pacific Health Summit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Health_Summit" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Health_Summit</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Location: Seattle<br>
<br>
The goal of the Pacific Health Summit is to connect science, industry, and policy for a healthier world....<br>
<br>
History<br>
The first Pacific Health Summit was held in Seattle, Washington in 2005 with foundational support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Russell Family Foundation</span>.[1] It was the co-creation of 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine winner Leland H. Hartwell, businessman and philanthropist <span style="color:#FFFF40">George F. Russell Jr.</span>, Co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation William H. Gates Sr., and Founding Director of the National Bureau of Asian Research’s Center for Health and Aging Michael Birt.[2] NBR has been the Secretariat of the Summit since the inaugural 2005 conference...<br>
<br>
Building on Bill Gates Sr.'s strong personal support, in 2007 Tachi Yamada, then President of Global Health at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, took on a decisive leadership role and formally established the Foundation as the Summit's third co-presenting organization.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">In 2008, the Wellcome Trust joined the Summit as the fourth official co-presenting organization, and Trust Director, Sir Mark Walport, joined our Executive Committee. Both Sir William Castell, Chairman of the Wellcome Trust, who has participated in the Summit since its first year, and Sir Mark provided crucial leadership as the Summit began its rotation in London for the annual meeting.</span><br>
<br>
Peter Neupert, then Corporate Vice President for Health Solutions Strategy for Microsoft, and Craig Mundie, Chief Research and Strategy Officer of Microsoft, consistently provided a private sector perspective to the Summit's strategic discussions. Additionally, GE Healthcare, through Bill Castell in 2005, has always provided critical advice and perspective, as well as the critical founding sponsorship for the annual meeting.<br>
<br>
Outcomes<br>
The Summit has been a catalyst for partnerships, and the setting of several global health announcements.[3] In 2007, during a speech[4] at the Summit, Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, publicized “a new initiative to establish a world stockpile of vaccines to prepare for the threat of pandemic influenza.”[5] At the Summit in 2009, Sanofi bolstered that stockpile with 100 million donated doses of flu vaccine.[6] Other partnerships furthered by, or formed at, the Summit have helped to lead to the establishment of the MSD Wellcome Trust Hilleman Laboratories,[7] the Access to Nutrition Index, the Critical Path to TB Drug Regimens,[8] and a cervical cancer vaccination deal between Merck &amp; Co. and Qiagen.[9] Additionally, the denial of a US visa for 2009 Summit participant Paul Thorn of the Tuberculosis Survival Project, due to his HIV positive status, became the impetus behind the repeal of a US travel restriction law on individuals carrying the HIV/AIDs virus.</div></blockquote>

<br>
The investigation of Delo attempting to untangle the tentacles of the United Group's ownership structure made one thing clear: the owners were hiding behind a series of veils. What was less clear was whether Solak was one of the owners or one of the veils.<br>
<br>
Solak did not operate alone. His overseas financiers, including KKR, were majority partners in all of his operations. They were the ones who allowed him to retain his position at the head of the United Group and who were keeping a watchful eye over his spectacular rise from the very beginnings, according to a diplomatic cable of the US Embassy in Belgrade revealed by WikiLeaks. It is unfortunate that this source, although readily available on the internet, has not been considered so far...Polt's successor, <span style="color:#FFFF40">Cameron Munter</span>, continued his post-diplomatic career at Mid Europa as an advisor to SBB / Telemach during negotiations with Petraeus in 2013. ..<br>

Here is a brief history of DVC ownership from 1997 to 2017. Today Dynport is owned by CSRA. <br>

Before teaming up with Dyncorp, Porton (UK) had created a US branch of their company know as BioPort.

The ceremony, sponsored by the UN’s Office on Drugs and Crime (and underwritten by Egyptian businessman Shafik Gabr), included valedictory speeches not just by Ban but also by Nicolas Cage, who began by saying, “I’m here not as an actor but as someone who cares about children.”..... “It isn’t often that the UN has so many bold-faced names in one room,” Ban told the crowd, as Eli and Edythe Broad left for the auction at Sotheby’s. “You could be at more fabulous parties and in more glamorous locations, but you are here because you care about putting an end to human trafficking.”<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A lawsuit brought against artist Ross Bleckner by his former assistant Cody Gilman has been settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. The settlement was reached on August 4, and the suit has been dismissed with prejudice, which means that Gilman cannot file suit against Bleckner again.<br>
<br>
A representative for New York’s Petzel gallery, which represents Bleckner, said that Bleckner and Gilman had both signed NDAs and therefore could not comment. ..Bleckner and Gilman’s dueling suits unfurled a web of allegations of sexual harassment, assault, and extortion. They centered around a relationship that allegedly impacted both parties’ work and personal lives. According to Gilman, the relationship had been a professional one, and he alleged that Bleckner had sexually harassed him. According to Bleckner, the relationship was consensual; he accused Gilman of using the sexual harassment claims to extort him for $2 million.<br>
<br>
Bleckner, whose work has been featured in two Whitney Biennials and was given a Guggenheim Museum retrospective in 1995, met Gilman, who has previously done modeling work, through a dating website, though the lawsuits provide two differing dates for when and how the two began their relationship...

<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">This health investor shadowed Jeff Bezos and worked for Bill Gates — here’s what he learned</span> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/19/investor-peter-neupert-shadowed-jeff-bezos-and-worked-for-bill-gates.html" class="postlink">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/19/investo ... gates.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Peter Neupert started at Microsoft in the 1990s and late came back for a second stint to launch a health group...When he was taking the CEO job of Drugstore.com in 1998, he spent a few days shadowing Jeff Bezos, who helped recruit him for the position...<br>
<br>
Jeff Bezos’s ambitions in health care are no longer a secret. Between the Haven partnership with J.P. Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, his company’s stealthy work in cancer research, investments in health clinics for employees and last year’s $753 million purchase of online drug seller PillPack, the Amazon CEO is openly taking on the $3.5 trillion health-care industry.<br>
<br>
While most of those developments are very recent, <span style="color:#FF0040">Bezos has had his eyes on this market for over two decades</span>. Nobody knows that better than Peter Neupert, who became CEO of online pharmacy Drugstore.com in 1998, after <span style="color:#BF0040">Bezos recruited him for the job in tandem with Amazon’s investment in the company.</span><br>
<br>
It was the beginning of a long relationship between the two and their effort to apply emerging technologies to life sciences. Neupert went on to Microsoft, his second stint at the company, where he led a new health solutions group. He left in 2012 and has since been a sought-after advisor for hospitals, biotech companies and start-ups....<br>
<br>
...Amazon is hiring aggressively at PillPack to become a major player in prescription delivery and is exploring a host of efforts to bring down the cost of care. Neupert is on the board of medical lab company<span style="color:#FFFF40"> LabCorp, as well as Adaptive Biotechnologies</span>, which recently went public, and a couple early-stage ventures. He’s also on the board of trustees at the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</span>.<br>
<br>
...Neupert was working for Bill Gates at Microsoft, where he’d launched the MSNBC network as a joint venture with NBC. He was approached by John Doerr of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins about a new start-up that aimed to sell prescription medicines, beauty products and over-the-counter drugs online. Doerr, an early Amazon investor and board member at the time, brought Bezos along for the recruiting meeting.<br>
<br>
..In April 1999, two months after Drugstore announced the investment from Amazon and Kleiner Perkins, Bezos and Neupert appeared together on Charlie Rose. The host asked Neupert why a consumer would rather buy from Drugstore than their local pharmacy.<br>

a shotgun blast. His death was later ruled a suicide, notwithstanding the fact that his firearms had supposedly been confiscated by the police several days before, after the attempted murder of his business<br>
partner, a crime for which he was a principal suspect. <span style="color:#FFFF40">Only later was it revealed that Ford had served<br>
as a consultant to both the CIA and the chemical- and biological-weapons program of the South African Defense Forces, headed by Wouter Basson</span>. Ford’s contributions to Basson’s program included<br>
lecturers on converting ordinary items into lethal biological weapons. After Ford’s death his Irvine<br>
neighborhood was evacuated for several days as federal authorities excavated a weapons’ bunker in<br>
Ford’s yard and removed samples of various toxic biological agents found in Ford’s refrigerators. The<br>
specific biological agents found in Ford’s home have never been identified by the authorities, nor have<br>
they reported if any toxic agents were found in the university and other laboratories used by Ford. An<br>
initially frenzied FBI investigation quickly became quiescent. One Ford associate reports that Ford<br>
had been in contact with <span style="color:#FF0040">BioPort Corporation</span>, sole U.S. manufacturer of anthrax vaccine..<br>
<br>
Ford’s colleague Wouter Basson, M.D., headed the South African biowarfare program from its<br>
inception in the late 1970s until it was nominally abandoned in 1993. Arrested in 1997 on charges of<br>
murder, embezzlement and drug violations, Basson’s trial commenced in 1999 and continues today. Sessions of Basson’s South African trail were held in Florida in January 2000 to hear testimony<br>
of attorney David R. Webster, who had created a complex of off-shore companies and accounts<br>
through which Basson operated.9 Revelations in the course of his trial include: Basson claims to have<br>
enjoyed access to the <span style="color:#FF0040">U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases [AMRIID] and<br>
Porton Down</span>, respectively the principal U.S. and U.K. chemical-biological warfare establishments.<br>
Basson was involved in several undertakings (of an undetermined nature) withLibyans and made numerous trips to Libya, continuing after his program was terminated (leading to successful British and<br>
U.S. demands that he be reemployed, and controlled, by the South African government). He also had<br>
established relationships in the U.S.S.R. and in a number of eastern and western European countries.<br>
South African responsibility for a major anthrax outbreak in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1979 is<br>
currently being investigated. Basson is alleged to have developed such means of delivery of biological<br>
agents as, e.g., anthrax-laced cigarettes..<br>
<br>
In the early 1980s a significant part of the “civilian” component of the British Porton Down complex,<br>
the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research [CAMR], was privatized as Porton International,<br>
a creation of Wensley Haydon-Baillie, who reputedly became one of the 50 wealthiest persons in<br>
Britain as a result of what was alleged to have been politicalfavoritismin the acquisition of government<br>
assets by Porton International. At least by the early 1990s Ibrahim and <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Fuad El-Hibri</span> acquired an<br>
interest in Porton International and/or related Proton Down spin-offs, Porton Products and Speywood<br>
Holdings, and were instrumental in obtaining anthrax vaccine in the U.K. for Saudi Arabia</span>. In 1997 the<br>
U.S. Department of Defense awarded a defense-biologics contract in excess of $300 million to Dynport LLC, which is a joint venture of Porton International and U.S. defense contractor Dyncorp. By<br>
the late 1990s Haydon-Baillie had lost control of Porton International(accused of personal enrichment<br>
at the expense of the company), entered bankruptcy and been arrested for tax fraud. Haydon-Baillie’s<br>
current activities have not been reported, but his history is instructive with reference to the careers of<br>
those who have secured control of significant components of the biowarfare complex..<br>
<br>
...By a process reminiscent of Haydon-Baillie’s creation of Porton International, in 1998 Ibrahim and<br>
Fuad El-Hibri and AdmiralWilliam J. Crowe, Jr., who had just returned froma posting as ambassador to the United Kingdom, created BioPort Corporation, which acquired the State of Michigan’s<br>
Biological Products Laboratory, the principal function of which was the production of anthrax vaccine<br>
for the U.S. Department of Defense. This “privatization” of a state laboratory was highly questionable<br>
in a number of respects. The managers of the public laboratory, director Robert Myers and deputy<br>
director Robert van Ravenswaay (an attorney on the state’s central administrative staff assigned to<br>
oversee the privatization process), appear to have insured that the successful bidder (one of only two<br>
final bidders) would give them a significant share of the ownership (as much as 32 percent) of the new<br>
entity. AdmiralCrowe obtained his interest (approximately 13 percent) as what appears to have been<br>
a “gift” of the El-Hibris. Together, the ownership interests of Crowe and Nancy Grunenwald El-Hibri<br>
were claimed to give American citizens majority ownership, even prior to Fuad El-Hibri’s adoption of<br>
American citizenship. ...</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Wouter Basson (born 6 July 1950) is a South African cardiologist and former head of the country's secret chemical and biological warfare project, Project Coast, during the apartheid era.[1] Nicknamed "Dr. Death" by the press for his alleged actions in apartheid South Africa, Basson was acquitted in 2002 of 67 charges, after having been suspended from his military post with full pay in 1999.[2]<br>
<br>
Among other charges, Basson was alleged to have supplied a "lethal triple cocktail of powerful muscle relaxants which were used during Operation Duel (the systematic elimination of SWAPO prisoners of war and South African Defence Force [SADF] members who posed a threat to South African covert operations).[3][4] The United Nations report "Project Coast: Apartheid's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme."[1] identifies the triple cocktail as ketamine, succinylcholine, and tubocurarine.[1]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ian Paterson, a breast surgeon who worked at Bupa hospitals in Solihull and Sutton Coldfield, latterly run by Spire Healthcare,[6] was convicted of 17 counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and three counts of unlawful wounding in respect of 10 patients.[7] 350 patients who had been treated privately at Spire clinics are pursuing civil action against him and against the company. According to Thompsons Solicitors, Spire had allowed him to operate well after 2012, when he had been suspended by the General Medical Council.[8] Spire's statement was "What Mr Paterson did in our hospitals, in other private hospitals, and in the NHS absolutely should not have happened, and today justice has been done."[9] He has been jailed for 20 years and £37 million allocated for compensation</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/31/breast-surgeon-ian-paterson-sentenced-for-carrying-out-needless-operations" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/201 ... operations</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Paterson was employed by the Heart of England NHS trust in 1998 despite having previously been suspended from Good Hope hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. He also practised at Spire Healthcare hospitals in the Midlands over a 13-year period...<br>
<br>
Speaking on the steps of the court, Diane Green, who was not a named victim in the trial but underwent such a procedure at Paterson’s hands, said others who worked with the surgeon now needed to be investigated. “He has been stopped, but we need to look to those who were co-conspirators, who let this go on, who saw this happening and said nothing,” she said.<br>
<br>
“I lost my home, I lost my marriage, I lost my health, I lost my job, I lost absolutely everything. He took everything away from me. This has been going on since the 90s and only today have I got justice. He took away my youth.”<br>
<br>
West Midlands police said they had investigated those linked to Paterson, but that further charges would be considered only if fresh information came to light.<br>
<br>
John Ingram said: “I think there was a big space in the dock. Mr Paterson was in there on his own. There are some people who think there should have been a corporate entity in that dock, and that is the corporate entity that allowed him to carry out this dreadful system within their building.”..<br>
<br>
Spire Healthcare, which runs Parkway and Little Aston hospitals where Paterson practised, has settled some cases, but argue that as Paterson was not technically their employee, they are not responsible for his actions. The company would not provide any details about the compensation paid. After the sentenced was passed down, a Spire spokesman said the company was “truly sorry for the distress caused to Paterson’s victims”.<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FFFF40">Charlie Massey, chief executive and registrar of the GMC</span>, said the medical world was now “fundamentally different”, but added: “It is absolutely right that questions are asked about how this happened and more crucially how the health system can prevent it from happening again.”

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The General Medical Council (GMC) is a public body that maintains the official register of medical practitioners within the United Kingdom...<br>
<br>
In July 2010 the GMC was severely criticized in an open letter in the <span style="color:#FF0040">British Medical Journal by Professionals Against Child Abuse for the decision to include Penny Mellor on the GMC's Expert Group on Child Protection</span>. According to the letter, Penny Mellor had been convicted and imprisoned for conspiring to abduct a child, and had led protracted hostile campaigns including false allegations against doctors and other professionals involved in child protection cases. She had also campaigned against Sir Roy Meadow and Professor David Southall, who were erased from the medical register by the GMC but subsequently re-instated after court rulings.[63] Penny Mellor subsequently resigned from the Expert Group...<br>
<br>
Controversy arose in July 2016 when the General Medical Council announced it would be appointing Charlie Massey as its new CEO.[66] <span style="color:#FF0040">Massey had been an adviser to health secretary <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Jeremy Hunt</span></span> on the controversial Junior doctors contract, which had led to several days of industrial action by doctors over concerns about feasibility and patient safety.[67] Many doctors felt this reflected a clear conflict of interest and signed a petition to the medical council for transparency in its appointment process. The medical council issued a response claiming that they were still an independent body.[68] Massey had also signally failed to distinguish himself in front of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament...<br>
<br>
The Council is composed of six medical professionals and six lay members.[69] The current Chair of the General Medical Council is Dame Clare Marx,[70] the first woman to be chair of the GMC. The current chief executive and registrar is Charlie Massey.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Research suggests that there may be a link between Gulf War Syndrome and vaccinations, especially the experimental vaccine for anthrax. Here’s what Gulf War veterans should know... In addition to being exposed to various environmental hazards and toxic chemicals, Gulf War veterans were also given a large number of vaccines. Service members may have received as many as 17 vaccines in a short period of time. These vaccinations included the botulinum toxoid vaccine and anthrax vaccine, was were not yet approved by the FDA. Other vaccines included yellow fever, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis B, meningitis, whooping cough, polio, and tetanus.<br>
<br>
Vaccinations were required by all forces, not just US troops. BioPort, now Emergent Biosolutions, was the exclusive manufacturer of BioThrax at the time, and this vaccine had proven to be effective against the bacterium that’s acquired through the skin, but not when the bacterium is inhaled. So, there was no Food and Drug Administration licensing for use against inhaled Anthrax. Therefore, all vaccinations given to military personnel were considered an “off-label” or experimental use of the vaccine....<br>
<br>
Despite concerns about its safety, the Department of Defense mandated that all military personnel be vaccinated with BioThrax prior to deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. They then expanded the anthrax vaccine immunization program to all US Military forces and DOD civilian contractors. With the expansion, BioPort Corp requested FDA approval for to include aerosol exposure approval, switching to intramuscular injections, and reducing the number of doses. In 1997, the DOD required that 2.5 million military personnel receive the Anthrax vaccine. By 1998, it was mandated for all civilian DOD personnel as well.<br>
<br>
..Due to questions about the contents and safety of the vaccine; in October 2004, US District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ruled that it was illegal for the federal government to mandate anthrax vaccinations. Judge Sullivan banned the Pentagon from forcing military personnel serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, South Korea, and part of Asia and Africa to get the anthrax shots without their prior consent. The military could not require the vaccine until the FDA approved it for the specific use of inhaled anthrax. However, those who refused quickly found themselves, for various other reasons, no longer in military service.<br>
<br>
One of the ingredients found in BioThrax was squalene. Squalene, a banned chemical additive and the vaccine adjuvant, was found in blood tests of hundreds of sick Gulf War veterans. Squalene is not approved for internal human use other than in highly controlled experiments, but it has been studied for use as a tool to boost the body’s immune systems against certain diseases.<br>
<br>
...In 2002, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a study on adverse reactions of those who received anthrax vaccines in response to a large number of pilots leaving ranks. The most common reported reactions that lasted longer than 7 days were limited motion/pain in the arm, extreme fatigue, joint pain, and memory loss. Some debilitating issues that have been reported to Walter Reed Hospital include muscle and joint weakness, chronic fatigue, intense migraines, cognitive problems, and even some severe diseases such as multiple sclerosis and vision loss.</div></blockquote></div>
