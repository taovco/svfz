			<div class="content">Or John Fucks Kids, same thing really. At any rate JFK and his family are one of the most corrupt in US history, yet I've seen many people praise him with blatantly false information. Let's dive in:<br>
<br>
1. Kennedy won his election. He most likely didn't. The first thing to note is he indisputably lost the popular vote, in Alabama people voted for electors, not candidates, and 6 of the Democratic electors refused to pledge to vote for Kennedy, the only way for him to win the popular vote is he has to win all votes cast for the Democratic electors, which is absurd as Byrd was clearly the more popular Democrat. As for the electoral college the Catholic mayor of Chicago likely rigged Illinois (this is even somewhat accepted by historians), the judge who was supposed to investigate was the mayor's friend though; furthermore California and Illinois have voted together every election from 1916 to today except for in 1960. Texas was completely controlled by LBJ who is known (as in accepted historical fact) to have rigged elections on multiple occasions: courts, legislatures, etc, yet it is known there were massive voting irregularities along the border, as in more people voted than who lived there. Plus Texas had no way to have a recount in 1960 as well. Also this was supposedly the last time Ohio voted for the loser until 2020, which isn't super damming as the other two are but still worth noting.<br>
<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/donald-trump-2016-rigged-nixon-kennedy-1960-214395" class="postlink">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story ... 960-214395</a><br>
<br>
2. JFK stopped WW3. Most people point to the Cuban missile crisis, however they ignore that was the result of JFK 1: sticking nukes in Turkey, and 2: being perceived as a beta male faggot by Kruschev in Austria. The Cuba missile crisis ended because Kruschev backed down.<br>
<br>
3. JFK was going to reinstate the gold standard that his family friend FDR got rid of. People point to EO 1110, however the expressed purpose of that was to make removing the gold standard easier.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110</a><br>
<a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-11110-amendment-executive-order-no-10289-amended-relating-the-performance" class="postlink">https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documen ... erformance</a><br>
<br>
4. JFK was anti Israel. His fucking campaign song defends Israel. People pointed to him not wanting them to have nukes, which is true, however Israel's prime minister at the time of JFK's death (Levi Eshkol, if his predecessor was Kissinger he'd be Bernie Sanders) didn't really want nukes and instead wanted US protection (which JFK supported). It seems Lee Harvey Oswald may have killed Kennedy, who got killed by a Jewish pimp who loved Kennedy. Or God himself killed Kennedy for his unrepentant sins.<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/yxGaa3xDGAU" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/yxGaa3xDGAU</a><br>
<br>
5. Vietnam. Kennedy sent US "advisors" to Vietnam, ramping up the war, not ending it as some suggest he would have. Plus he had a speech that amounted to America should be the world's policemen. Ironically that's the "Ask not what your country can do for you" speech. Ask what you can do for Israel, er South Vietnam, er your country!<br>
<a href="https://www.ushistory.org/documents/ask-not.htm" class="postlink">https://www.ushistory.org/documents/ask-not.htm</a><br>
<br>
6. He was a war hero. He dumbly tried to find a Japanese ship to attack for his own glory, resulting in his ship getting sunk. He did get his crew to an island but I think that's the least he could have done. He and his dad tried bitching to the military because he only received a bronze star without a combat citation.<br>
<br>
7. This point just gets ignored but he supported the 1965 Immigration Act.<br>
<br>
8. LBJ carried out everything JFK wanted to but was too retarded to carry out. So if you dislike LBJ you dislike Kennedy.<br>
<br>
9. He was a massive man whore.<br>
<br>
10. His family was corrupt as fuck. From his brother getting away with drowning his mistress to his dad selling all his stocks conveniently right before the Great Depression hit (resulting in JFK living a life of zero struggle) suggesting he was told before hand. His dad also had a fake medical exam done for JFK to get into the Navy (since he was such a limp wristed faggot he couldn't have otherwise). His other brother also got shot by a Palestinian Lutheran for running for President on a solely pro Israel platform.<br>
<br>
11. He was kind. Kind of a dick maybe. Supposedly his SS detail and Nixon said he was cold and rude to everyone.<br>
<br>
12. The media loved him because he was shot. The media did love him, but it was because he loved the media. Most people use his "secret societies" speech as evidence he was based, I assume those people only read the title. He gave the speech in secret to media Jew executives where he said the media wasn't corrupt and Republicans were crazy for questioning it.<br>
<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/john-f-kennedy-secret-societies-speech-transcript" class="postlink">https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/jo ... transcript</a><br>
<br>
So in short, fuck JFK. Conspiracies about him are blatantly untrue and are controlled opposition.</div>
