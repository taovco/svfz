			<div class="content">Just as the name suggests, unfortunately I know more about certain presidents than others and it will probably show, also I won't be including the current house nigger. I say this can be broken into fourths, so every 11 presidents. Top/bottom 1/4 fucked over America hard, next 1/4 were bad presidents somehow, next 1/4 were good just not great, and the best 1/4 are the best. Anyway let's go:<br>
<br>
44. James Buchanan. Really just a lame duck president at the worst possible time. He neither supported nor stopped Southern succession while president which made the Civil War more violent than it needed to be. He was possibly a homosexual as well as he never married.<br>
<br>
43. George W Bush. Stole the election from Al Gore (not that he'd be a great president but it was still fucked up). Invaded Afghanistan because Israel did 9-11, I imagine he had to know but ignorance is no excuse if it gets people killed. Invaded Iraq for not sucking Israel's cock. Supported endless immigration. Passed the Patriot Act. Definitely a homosexual despite being married.<br>
<br>
42. JFK. I've talked about him before: <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2461" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?t=2461</a>. The short version is he was a corrupt man whore who stole an election who supported terrible Jewish policies he was too inept to pass. He is only popular for dying and sucking up to the media historians.<br>
<br>
41. Franklin Pierce. He tried to get rid of the Missouri compromise, which would mean bringing more blacks into America.<br>
<br>
40. Harry Truman. He nuked Japan after it surrendered, according to the OSS/CIA. He nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan's Christian city. He also let communists take over China while overseeing the allies rape of Germany. He possibly had Patton killed, and fired MacArthur, two very fine generals. It gets ignored but even in the most charitable description of him he was a full on war criminal.<br>
<br>
39. FDR. I considered putting him lower but, eh, he didn't nuke a country after it surrendered. FDR caused war with Japan by sending an ultimatum (the Hull note) to get out of French Indochina or else there would be war, this is extremely cruel as the note he was supposed to send was supposed to negotiate a permanent peace with Japan but he sidelined Congress. However I think his end goal of war was to fix the American economy as his poor policies had failed to do so, as opposed to wanting to give Jews world domination, although he might have been Jewish. If I'm right he technically succeeded. He also wanted Germany to keep more land after the war (although as multiple countries). His popularity at the time is over exaggerated as in 1940 the Republicans choose to run the least popular candidate Wilkie who was the only one who was openly pro war, and he still managed to win 45% of the vote.<br>
<br>
38. Andrew Johnson. He completely fucked up my numbering, he was also the first president impeached. He passed a soft reconstruction though. Just not much to say.<br>
<br>
37. Herbert Hoover. He let FDR become president. Although he was tough as nails.<br>
<br>
36. Woodrow Wilson. WW1, Federal Reserve, income tax. Although he supposedly regretted all of those things.<br>
<br>
35. Donald Trump. He ruthlessly lied to his supporters or was genuinely retarded in keeping his promises, all of which could have been kept with or without Congress. Although he may have ended the war in Afghanistan, so props for that.<br>
<br>
34. Barack Obama. He beat John McCain, if he only had one term I'd rank him in the top ten for that alone. Otherwise he was pretty bad, however the Republicans kept him in check a solid 10% of the time.<br>
<br>
33. Bill Clinton. Purely an opportunist, also pardoned Susan Rosenberg, Jewish terrorist who now funds blm.<br>
<br>
32. James Garfield. There's really nothing to say, his presidency didn't even last a year.<br>
<br>
31. Jimmy Carter. Really nice guy, not a good president. Gave away the Panama Canal and turned against South Africa. Also pardoned draft dodgers. He is anti abortion though. He also kicked Ted Kennedy's ass so props there.<br>
<br>
30. LBJ. His accomplishments were terrible but they were numerous. He was the most competent of all modern Democrats. This could also be a reason to put him lower.<br>
<br>
29. Ronald Reagan. I have mixed feelings, I want to like him but his policies were terrible. He was anti gun, pro illegal immigration, pro war, pro whoring, and his economic policies were irrelevant in the long term. He sabotaged Ford's campaign. However he was anti crime. He was also funny. He did damn the Republican party though and was senile. Honestly I think he should be lower but I already made the list.<br>
<br>
28. Martin Van Buren. Known for his bad economy.<br>
<br>
27. George HW Bush. His policies were terrible but like LBJ he carried them out well. If reelected he might have actually become less in support of war which means we'd have a more powerful Serbia which might mean Europe's migrant crisis would be lessened, though I'm sure it would still exist. He also understood wars cost money.<br>
<br>
26. Zachary Taylor. He died, not much to say.<br>
<br>
25. Warren G Harding. Corrupt administration.<br>
<br>
24. John Tyler. Extremely pro states rights, however he didn't accomplish much in grand scheme of things. He did annex Texas though.<br>
<br>
23. US Grant. Corrupt administration. Good man and general though.<br>
<br>
22. John Quincy Adams. Not outright terrible but he set the precedent of relatives of presidents being elected and doing a worse job.<br>
<br>
21. Teddy Roosevelt. While he was pro man, pro nature, and anti monopoly; he was staunchly pro war and pro Jew. He also sabatoged Tafts reelection and gave us Woodrow Wilson.<br>
<br>
20. Taft. Not much to say about him, he was supposedly really smart and his son was cool though.<br>
<br>
19. William McKinley. Also a better Teddy Roosevelt, except he died and let Teddy Roosevelt become president.<br>
<br>
18. Benjamin Harrison. Passed the Sherman Antitrust act, the McKinley tariff, and national forests reserve act. He's the better Teddy Roosevelt.<br>
<br>
17. Grover Cleveland. He weirdly mirrors Trump, except more competent. He's an establishment guy who fought against the establishment, also from New York, and acted like a common man of the time.<br>
<br>
16. Dwight Eisenhower. Terrible general, used forced to enforce desegregation. Also ended the Korean war and got us our highways.<br>
<br>
15. Rutherford Hayes. Sleeper pick right here. He ended reconstruction and was a big supporter of meritocracy, and saved Paraguay if you're into that. He supported the gold standard as well.<br>
<br>
14. Calvin Coolidge. Did nothing his whole presidency besides speak out against war. Very respectable. Also never talked. Once at a party a woman bet him she could get him to say 3 words that evening. He replied "you lose."<br>
<br>
13. Chester Arthur. Banned Chinese drug addicts, criminal immigrants, and disease ridden immigrants. He also was very against corruption and created a good economy.<br>
<br>
12. Millard Fillmore. He was anti Masonic and anti immigration. He also passed the compromise of 1850 which prevented importing more blacks and had the fugitive slave act. A fair compromise.<br>
<br>
11. John Adams. Heavy hitters from here. Helped found America, set the precedent of a peaceful transition of power. Refused to go to war with France to win reelection for the good of his country.<br>
<br>
10. James Monroe. The Monroe Doctrine was dope.<br>
<br>
9. James Madison. "Beat" the British in the War of 1812.<br>
<br>
8. Lincoln. I imagine most of you will disagree. However his idea of one united America wasn't bad, granted a union under threat of force isn't a good idea, plus slavery is wack. He probably would have given blacks Cuba instead of forcing everyone to live together.<br>
<br>
7. Polk. Annexed the area between Texas and California in one term, then didn't bother to run again.<br>
<br>
6. Andrew Jackson. He killed the bank (hence why bankers put him on the 20 dollar bill). He also told the Supreme Court to go fuck themselves and passed the Indian Removal Act. Not because he hated Indians, in fact he adopted two, but because he believed it would be safer for everyone if Indians had a country seperate from whites.<br>
<br>
5. Gerald Ford. Pardoned Nixon, despite him doing nothing wrong. Supported South Africa as much as he could. Cut aid off to Israel for starting yet another war (resulting in 75 US senators begging him to resume aid to them). Cut aid to Jew York after they wasted all their money like a bunch of retards resulting in them having power outages. Didn't shut down the country over a disease (swine flu, actually real that time, however still unimportant).<br>
<br>
4. Richard Nixon. Passed the EPA. Fought communists. Fought hippies. Put down rioters. Was tough on crime. Ended the draft. Temporarily won the Vietnam War. Helped white Latino countries fight communists. Passed the DEA to try and rehabilitate returning Vietnam vets who became drug addicts. Declared war on sickle cell disease and cancer. Was based on Jews and blacks. Began a peaceful end to the Cold War. Prevented America's economy from crashing. Lowered the voting age to 18. If he had a flaw it was his unwavering loyalty to the American system. He was robbed twice, first by JFK in 1960, then when he was forced to resign after winning in the biggest election landslide in recent history. Nixon had no involvement in the Watergate break in according to even modern historians (in fact the actual purpose of the whole Watergate affair was to stop the Washington Post from leaking illegal information about the Vietnam War) his "crime" was refusing to hand over the original copies of his original tape recordings that were unrelated to the case. Had Nixon not been so unwaveringly patriotic he would have had the CIA wipe out the fags in Congress and the Justice Department for trying to overturn a fair election, but alas, he was too selfless to do that.<br>
<br>
3. Thomas Jefferson. Fittingly third. Bought the Louisiana territory. Supported liberty within reason. Tried not to violate the constitution he wrote. Owned a bear.<br>
<br>
2. George Washington. Showed what a good president should be. Unbiased. Leading from the front. Humble.<br>
<br>
1. William Henry Harrison. Shortest ruling president, unironically a good trait. Plus he was very American, choosing to chill on his porch to drink cider, and dying of pneumonia.</div>

Are you retarded? Like genuinely? Nixon and Ford are like the last two presidents who weren't kike puppets. Nixon stopped bussing niglets across states for school and quit forcing white kids to learn in ghettos despite the Supreme Court demanding it. Nixon even named the Jews and concluded blacks and whites couldn't coexist. Ford cut aid to Israel and Jew York and aided South Africa.<br>
Yeah the number of fucks I give about China are pretty low. Plus that led to a peaceful end to the cold war by playing the Soviets and China against one another. He fought communists in America by working with Joe McCarthy, except Nixon was always right, and then as president.</div>

Lincoln worked right alongside with "Radical Republicans" that said they wanted Southern White men exterminated and Southern White women and girls raped by niggers, Lincoln was a race traitor piece of shit. (f.y.i. I am saying this as a Northerner).  Nixon competed with Kennedy in the 1958 election in which both promised to desegregate the South and did nothing when they enforced busing niggers into White schools in 1971.  Also massive lol at the idea that it was "muh communists" that were fucking over our country and not the Capitalist ruling elite which ran and had direct ties with Hollywood and the MSM.
</div></blockquote>

Not exactly. He believed slavery was wrong and was right, however when the civil war broke out his initial goal was to preserve the union. He only bothered freeing slaves in states that succeeded to prevent Britain or France from intervening. In the 1860 election he said while slavery was evil he also said whites and blacks were not equal and could not live together in one country.<br>
<br>
I see. You are special needs. *1960 election. Nixon refused to carry out the Supreme Courts gay demands for bussing so no. Well it's really Jews. However yes, white liberal hippies who identified with communism were a stain on America and should have been culled. Also capitalist elite like FDR, Hiss, the Kennedys, and Stevenson? While I realize capitalism is a false god, to say America's elite during Nixon's time was hyper capitalistic is an admission of knowing nothing about the subject.
</div></blockquote>

Lol, you think hyper-liberal Jewish Capitalists larping as Jewish communists equals them not being Capitalists... in other words you are a total retard and missed my point (it's not muh KGB it's the U.S. government dipshit).
</div></blockquote>

That's literally all communism is. Rich Jews convincing retards to kill their neighbors. See Lenin, Trotsky, Jakob Rosenfeld, etc. Additionally Nixon aided whites in South America against Jew backed commies. I didn't say it was the KGB my dear retard, as you know, I pointed out America's elites who held positions of power.<br>
Question. Since its clear you know absolutely nothing about Nixon and most likely anything, why do you feel the need to argue about him?</div>

</div></blockquote>

A solid list.<br>
<br>
I agree he's terrible, however I think it's a tight race in terrible for the ones I ranked lower than him. Perhaps I should have put him lower but I think I'm set on Buchanan and Bush. I put some of the blame for that on Churchill and Truman, although he is the most responsible for it. More land = Silesia and Pomerania.<br>
<br>
The Monroe doctrine was one of the first steps for Manifest Destiny (which was mostly aimed at Spain) as it prevented Spain from taking back Mexico which included Texas at the time. Also Spain allowed slavery in their colonies but also increased quality of life (not including diseases), so Spain taking back their colonies means more Spics not less. Granted later on it was used to keep Germany from taking over Venezuela which would have helped the Venezuelans, however it's main effect was letting the US expand West with less opposition. Not mentioned but should have been was he also tried to improve relations with Britain and Russia which was the first step in obtaining the North West, he supported sending blacks back to Africa, and he was from Virginia so automatic plus.</div>
