			<div class="content"><em class="text-italics">In this post I focus on the Dutch arm of an international pedophile ring that was broken up and only partly reported on by American news outlets ...</em><br>
<br>
Yesterday @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4289" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">EricKaliberhall</a> posted an article from the Washington Post relating to “Pizzagate’s violent legacy: QAnon” <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1978" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1978</a> .. Coincidentally, I happened to be looking into something else when I came across this related post : <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1516310" class="postlink"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#80BFFF">$1mil funding from Craig Newmark (craigslist), Poynter Journo School, Tampa Bay times, Politifact, Omidyar, Democracy now, Clinton Foundation, scrubbed news</span></span></a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Poynter Institute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynter_Institute" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynter_Institute</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Poynter Institute for Media Studies is a non-profit journalism school and research organization..The school is the owner of the <span style="color:#FFFF00">Tampa Bay Times newspaper and the International Fact-Checking Network</span>, and operates PolitiFact...Since 2019, The <span style="color:#FFFF00">Washington Post has been partnering with the Poynter Institute</span> ..Other sponsors are CNN, the Scripps Howard Foundations, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, the Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation and TEGNA Foundation.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

So, they are all part of the same network of gatekeepers, I mean journalists.. keep that in mind..<br>
<br>
<br>
back to that Voat post :<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>First picked up on this from&nbsp;[<a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1515874" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1515874</a>] &nbsp;about Tampa bay times removing a pedo article..<br>
As the link above shows, an&nbsp;article about a pedo trail that led to a number of people domestically and internationally&nbsp;was available at the Tampa Bay Times...best we can tell a couple weeks ago by the OP.
</div></blockquote>

The article was about Operation Holitna and only mentioned the involvement of a Dutch national without giving out any more information about that aspect of the case. Here again the Daily Mail writes about the operation without mentioning the Dutch arm at all.. Trigger warning: some of the details are gruesome and involves very young children <a href="https://archive.is/9ZXuS" class="postlink">https://archive.is/9ZXuS</a><br>
<br>
Onwards to Amsterdam : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_sex_crimes_case" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_sex_crimes_case</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The&nbsp;Amsterdam sex crimes case&nbsp;(Dutch:&nbsp;Amsterdamse zedenzaak) is a court case involving Robert Mikelson's abuse of babies in&nbsp;Amsterdam, the&nbsp;Netherlands. The&nbsp;defendant&nbsp;was Roberts Mikelson,[1]&nbsp;dubbed "the Monster of Riga" by the Dutch press,&nbsp;who had worked at several&nbsp;daycare&nbsp;centres in Amsterdam and was accused of abusing 87 children[4]&nbsp;as well as possession, production and distribution of&nbsp;child pornography. Mikelson was found guilty and sentenced to 18 years and 11 months in prison, followed by&nbsp;involuntary commitment <br>
<br>
Roberts Miķelsons  (born in&nbsp;Riga,&nbsp;Latvia, 14 September 1983) became a naturalized Dutch citizen in 2008. He was convicted of possession of&nbsp;child pornography in Germany&nbsp;in 2003 while working at a daycare facility in&nbsp;Heidelberg.[11]&nbsp;In 2004, he married Richard van Olffen. From 2007 to 2009, he worked at several daycare centres of <span style="color:#FFFF00">"het Hofnarretje" group</span>, and from 2009 to 2010, at "Jenno's Knuffelparadijs"....Richard van Olffen is accused of possession of child pornography as well as sexual assault on an 11-16-year-old boy, both of which he was acquitted. He is charged with being an accessory to the crimes of Robert Miķelsons</div></blockquote>

One of the striking things looking at Dutch articles is the lack of information .. looking around, I came across this piece which details the fact that mothers at the daycare had already started raising the alarm but were put off by the authorities who refused to investigate:<br>
<br>
Translated from Dutch : <a href="https://yersinia.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/grote-ontuchtzaak-in-amsterdam-updated/" class="postlink">https://yersinia.wordpress.com/2010/12/ ... m-updated/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..daycare center 'Het Hofnarretje' ..A complaint had previously been lodged against Mikelsons in connection with a suspicion of child abuse.&nbsp;At the time, this did not lead to a declaration.&nbsp;It now appears that two mothers who did want to report the crime <span style="color:#BFFF00">were not taken seriously by the police and the GGD in August 2008</span>. ..According to the police, "such young children are not reliable".&nbsp;In addition, they had called the director of the [daycare centre] and 'he had said that the children were lying'.<br>
According to Mayor Eberhard van der Laan, “an error of judgment” may have been made at the time.&nbsp;Police spokesman Jelmer Visser, however, denies that. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF00">One of the mothers had previously not been taken seriously by the <span style="text-decoration:underline">director of the daycare center</span> 'Het Hofnarretje' in the Van Woustraat.&nbsp;According to him, children younger than 4 tend to 'fantasize' a lot.</span> <br>
<br>
It now appears that Robert M., who calls himself a 'baby whisperer', has also worked as a volunteer in an orphanage in Kenya, Africa.&nbsp;He kept a&nbsp;website&nbsp;about his experiences there and posted photos on the Latvian network of friends draugiem.lv. ..Johan Richard van Olffen is owner of the website '&nbsp;boyhood-magazine.org&nbsp;' (link is to a server report, not to the website) which would give access to an underground pedophile forum according to 'de telegraaf' funded by one Arend (Jacobus) M However, the telegraph has had to rectify this conclusion because it is based on unfounded claims by Yvonne van Hertum.&nbsp;Van Olffen was also involved in youth water polo. <br>
<br>
..Latvian police meanwhile are investigating whether Mikelsons has been guilty of child abuse or other crimes in Latvia.&nbsp;He left Latvia in 2004. The police in Latvia announced that the Dutch police have not yet made a request for assistance.<br>
A childhood friend of Mikelsons, politician Ivar Tenters, 24, who would initially act as a lender for a childcare company to be set up by Mikelsons, hastened to declare that he had previously cut all business ties with Mikelsons. <br>
<br>
According to one of the parents involved, <span style="color:#FFFF00">Edwin Rotgans has regularly organized sleep parties in the home of Albert Drent, director of daycare center Het Hofnarretje, in Enkhuizen and 't Gooi.</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#FF0040">Mayor Eberhard van der Laan said yesterday that Drent is not a suspect at the moment.</span>&nbsp;“Amazing for me, for the parents, for the children,” the director responded to the news that his daycare center is involved in the case.&nbsp;Justice has announced that it will investigate these parties. 
</div></blockquote>

The director of the daycare Albert Drent was NOT a suspect?  Continuing from that article:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Update December 15, 2010&nbsp;:<br>
The departure of Drent is not as definitive as the municipality wanted us to believe yesterday.&nbsp;This is evident from the&nbsp;statement&nbsp;that Drent submitted yesterday.<span style="color:#FFBF00">&nbsp;Drent will continue as financial director and will remain the owner of 6 day-care centers.</span>&nbsp;The GG&amp;GD appoints an interim manager for day-to-day management.&nbsp;The case will be reviewed in February next year.&nbsp;So it seems primarily a cosmetic measure.<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">It has now become clear that parents were not necessarily welcome at the sleepovers that were held in the house of Drent in Bussum</span>.&nbsp;The arrested suspect Edwin Rotgans was present.&nbsp;Parents who brought their children to those fesstjes thought it initially 'strange', but were convinced and thought that it was 'just an active daycare'. <br>
<br>
The dubious parties for the children took place not only in the home of the owner of the daycare center Het Hofnarretje.&nbsp;<span style="color:#FFFF00">Robert Mikelsons also held 'drop-off parties' for the 4-year-old children who left for primary school.</span><br>
This happened in the clubhouse of the Saense Handboog Skutters on the Sportlaan in Zaandam.&nbsp;Those 'parties' were led by the main suspect Robert Mikelsons, his husband Richard van Olffen, who was also arrested, and the third suspect Edwin Rotgans. </div></blockquote>

Albert Drent hired a lawyer. <a href="https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/oud-directeur-het-hofnarretje-huurt-advocaat-knoops-in~a0868c10/" class="postlink">https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/oud-direct ... ~a0868c10/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Former owner Albert Drent of daycare center Het Hofnarretje in Amsterdam has hired lawyer <span style="color:#FFFF00">Geert-Jan Knoops</span> to prevent him from being prosecuted...A group of parents had reported Drent. They believed that the former director knew or should have known about the abuse and that he is therefore complicit in it.<br>
<br>
However, the Public Prosecution Service decided in November not to prosecute Drent. According to the judiciary, he was not aware of the abuse and cannot be held criminally responsible because of his position. A group of parents is now trying to enforce through the court that the Justice Department will prosecute Drent.</div></blockquote>

 Geert-Jan Knoops is no ordinary lawyer:  <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert-Jan_Knoops" class="postlink">https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert-Jan_Knoops</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Gerardus Godefridus Johannes Alexander (Geert-Jan) Knoops&nbsp; trained at the pedagogical academy from 1977 to 1980 and then officer training with the&nbsp;Marine Corps&nbsp;until 1982,&nbsp;after which he became commander of an infantry platoon...In 2002 he founded the Forensic Sciences Expert Center, which aims to provide attorneys with access to independent forensic experts, and that same year he was appointed a Reserve Major in the Marine Corps.&nbsp;As of February 1, 2003, Knoops was appointed professor of criminal law and criminal procedure law at the Faculty of Law of&nbsp;Utrecht University&nbsp;..<br>
<br>
Knoops is known as a lawyer for the Marine&nbsp;Eric O.&nbsp;, the brothers-in-law Wilco Viets and Herman du Bois (&nbsp;Putten murder case&nbsp;),&nbsp;Machiel Kuijt&nbsp;,&nbsp;Ernest Louwes&nbsp;(&nbsp;Deventer murder case&nbsp;),&nbsp;Julio Poch&nbsp;,&nbsp;Martien Hunnik&nbsp;(reopening the criminal case of the Hilversumse showbiz murder),&nbsp;Marco Kroon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Geert Wilders&nbsp;.&nbsp;[2]&nbsp;He also dealt with cases before the&nbsp;Yugoslavia Tribunal&nbsp;, the&nbsp;Rwanda Tribunal&nbsp;, and the&nbsp;Sierra Leon Tribunal&nbsp;.&nbsp;He also acted as an adviser in a trial before the&nbsp;US Supreme Courtwas brought in by&nbsp;Ahmed Hamden&nbsp; 
</div></blockquote>

Those are some pretty high profile cases. He's usually found at the Hague. The director of a group of child care companies hires a Hague lawyer?  I found this on instagram...   <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ByP7tYXixnn/" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/ByP7tYXixnn/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FFFF00">The K. family</span> has arranged for Robert Mikelsons to come to the&nbsp;#Netherlands&nbsp;from Germany. <span style="color:#FF0040">Mikelsons has been requested for his pedophilia and pedophile history in Germany</span>. The K. family has ensured that Robert Mikelsons, as an intermediate station between Germany and the Netherlands, stayed in a children's home in Africa for a long time. The son of the female owner of that African children's home lives in Amsterdam and is one of the many criminal assistants of the K. family. From the beginning, <span style="color:#FF0040"><strong class="text-strong">Robert Mikel's task has been to deliver babies and toddlers for the pedo association of high-ranking people.</strong></span> After the start of the daycare center, these babies and toddlers were handed over by Robert Mikelsons to his partner Richard van Olffen, who then came to the children's home with his van, equipped with 2 child seats. <span style="color:#FF0040">Richard van Olffen then brought those children to a high-ranking pedo who was allowed to go his own way. That against a cash settlement of between 5,000 and 15,000 per child per turn. ..</span><br>
<br>
Mikelsons received payment through his young Latvian boyfriend. Richard van Olffen's escort agenda included the cell phone number of&nbsp;#FritsvanStraelen&nbsp;of the OM in Amsterdam. 2005 and 2007, because Mikelsons then gave an address in Amsterdam on marktplaats.nl, the Amsterdam vice squad was told of the actual work of Robert Mikelsons. In 2005 and in 2007 the relevant Amsterdam vice detective brought it to the 3 corner and the 4 corner; further investigation has been withheld from a higher level. After Robert Mikelsons, via the US, and later Richard van Olffen, were arrested, the Amsterdam misconduct was again reminded of the reports in 2005 and 2007. But the Amsterdam misconduct investigated hastily that extensive investigations had been conducted all the way to Latvia, and that there is no evidence of a supply of high-ranking pedophiles. Well now read on wikipedia the lied version</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
<br>
So, who is the K family?  The answer to that was "Korlaar "

I've never known what to make of Annett but it is interesting that I got to that video via a pedophile case which has been documented in the MSM.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Kenya connection<br>
Last spring Robert Mikelson lived at an orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya, where he worked as a volunteer. The home provided a pre-school programme for young children. He wrote in a blog: “I met and helped many children there. The kids at this pre-school are in the age group between 3½ and 8. After that they move on to regular primary schools.” In the blog he also mentioned undergoing HIV testing.</div></blockquote>

I've been looking for further information on which Nairobi orphanage this could be but our intrepid gatekeepers, I mean journalists, have not provided a name.  We have posts on a notorious Nairobi orphanage for children with AIDS here on Voat.. <span style="color:#FFFF00">Nyumbani</span>.. there is no evidence to show a connection but it's a place where Oxford, Cambridge, UK government officials, a pedo BA pilot , Wasserman Schultz, Dr. Deborah Brix all visit .. voat posts <a href="https://searchvoat.co/search.php?t=nyumbani" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/search.php?t=nyumbani</a> and <a href="https://searchvoat.co/search.php?st=comments&amp;t=nyumbani" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/search.php?st=comments&amp;t=nyumbani</a><br>

It would be VERY interesting to find out which orphanage Mikelson was at..</div>

Soros London Headquarters: The Anglo-Dutch Royal Connection For Dope and War <a href="http://archive.is/hXwVK" class="postlink">http://archive.is/hXwVK</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau, daughter-in-law of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, is "Director of International Advocacy" for George Soros' Open Society Institute, based in Soros' London offices. A Dutch "Mata Hari" and long-time Soros employee, the Princess is also co-chairman of the European Council on Foreign Relations which Soros launched last year to guide the EU into Eurasian war. Her career story gives new meaning to the phrase, "the Soros human rights mafia."<br>
<br>
Around 1989, while she was at college (she graduated in 1993), Mabel got into a relationship with northern Europe's biggest drug-kingpin, the Dutch Klaas Bruinsma — an ultra-violent killer. Initially meeting him in high-society circles, Mabel went to spend nights on Bruinsma's yacht. Bruinsma's monumental narcotics trafficking (tens of thousands of kilos at a shot) was based on the <span style="color:#FFFF00">cooperation of the Dutch royal family</span>, the Nazi Prince Bernhard and others, who effectively legalized dope....<br>
<br>
..In the early 1990s, perhaps as a "student intern," Mabel worked for the Secretariat of the United Nations in New York; for Shell Oil Company in Malaysia; for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at The Hague; and for ABN-AMRO Bank in Barcelona.<br>

In her U.N. work, the late Bruinsma's moll, Mabel, took an immediate interest in — Yugoslavia. Mabel began an affair with Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Sacirbey. In 1994 she set up the "European Acton Council for Peace in the Balkans," in conjunction with Dutch lawyer Phon van den Biesen; he represented Bosnia at the International Court in The Hague, when Bosnia charged Serbia with genocide. Her group and her affair with Sacirbey are the subject of investigations charging her involvement with arms trafficking. She was ostensibly prosecuting Balkan war rather than peace.<br>

<span style="color:#FF0040">In 1995, Mabel co-founded a Dutch branch of the War Child group, using the name and logo of London's (British government-funded) War Child charity.</span> </div></blockquote>

Isn't it an interesting coincidence that CIA placement Meghan Markles married the second son of the British monarch while Mabel (also rumored to be CIA connected) married the second son of the Dutch monarch?</div>

This concerned 90,000 abused and tortured children and babies, which partly came to light through the Morkhoven action group.

Translated from Dutch: Missing German Manuel never solved despite tips <a href="https://www.ad.nl/amsterdam/vermissing-duitse-manuel-nooit-opgelost-ondanks-tips~aac0f1f0/" class="postlink">https://www.ad.nl/amsterdam/vermissing- ... ~aac0f1f0/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>12-year-old Manuel Schadwald, who has been missing since 1993, is said to have been horribly killed during a sex trip on a sailing boat, just outside Amsterdam. This is evident from investigations by the AD and Welt am Sonntag, who reveal that despite various denials, the police did receive concrete tips about the fate of the boy...<br>
<br>
Soon after the disappearance, the police received signals that Manuel has ended up in the Dutch child prostitution circuit. But after years of research, the Berlin, Rotterdam and Amsterdam police conclude that 'no indications' have been found for this. An investigation by Welt am Sonntag and the AD now leads to a different conclusion: the police and the AIVD received much more information than has been announced...<br>
<br>
.."An informant who is known to the vice squad as reliable, states that Manuel was seen on a boat. It is a sailboat called Apollo, which according to the informant has Spaarnwoude as its berth...In 2015, the 13-meter-long ketch appears to have been renamed years ago. The ship now serves as a charter ship in Scheveningen. But in the 1990s, the Apollo was indeed moored in the harbor of the fishing village of Spaarndam - on the outskirts of Spaarnwoude. This can be found in the property and insurance certificates of the Apollo, which are in the possession of the AD. More striking is that the sailing ship at that time was in the name of <span style="color:#FFFF00">a notorious pedophile: Gerrie Ulrich</span>.<br>
<br>
..During a motorcycle trip in Italy, Ulrich is shot dead by his younger friend. A few days after the death of the German, the police found tens of thousands of photos and videos of naked and abused children in his home. Ulrich's friend, who is also deep in the pedo-sex circuit, confesses just before the murder that he saw Manuel Schadwald in Amsterdam.<br>
<br>
In the 1990s, Amsterdam was considered a place of pilgrimage for pedophiles. Boy brothels openly advertise through the Spartacus, an international gay travel guide. There are even organized sex trips from countries like England to boy brothels in our capital. But for some it cannot go far enough, says the Englishman Edward in the TV documentary The boy business from 1997.<br>
<br>
..I read that a German boy died on a sailing boat. Because there were high-ranking people on board, the murder was concealed, "the source said." I was shocked when I read it. "<br>
<br>
Technical error<br>
The investigation at the Rotterdam police ended even more curiously. The so-called daily journals of the investigation into Manuel Schadwald, in which all activities of the police are described, appear to have been deleted in the computer. "A purely technical error," said spokesman R. Noordermeer of the Rotterdam Police in 1997. "It has been overwritten."..
