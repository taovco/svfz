But all that, of course, depends on how far we take it.<br>
<br>
The Crispr method uses bacterial enzymes of the Cas family, especially Cas9, to clip out a target gene – these proteins are part of the bacterial immune system. The enzyme is guided into place with a strand of RNA tailored to match the DNA of the gene in question.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Genetic vaccination</span></span><br>
<br>
That could be immensely beneficial. <span style="color:#FFFF40">Imagine using gene editing to produce people with a modified form of the gene</span> for CCR5, the protein that HIV latches onto to attack the immune system. They could never then catch AIDS, even if they were infected with HIV. The disease could not only be cured but effectively eliminated. <span style="color:#FFFF40">This strategy of ‘genetic vaccination’ has been proposed by George Church of Harvard University</span> in the US, who was involved in the first demonstration of Crispr in human cells in 2013.</div></blockquote> <br>

Vast oceans of data, processed by clever algorithms, allow scientists to quickly identify promising treatments with unheard of sophistication and speed. “The floodgates have opened, and now it’s up to us to do the absolute best that we can do,” said Aviv Regev, chair of the faculty at the Broad..<br>

Defects in genetic and developmental processes are thought to contribute susceptibility to autism and schizophrenia. Presumably, owing to etiological complexity identifying susceptibility genes and abnormalities in the development has been difficult. However, <span style="color:#FFFF40">the importance of genes within chromosomal 8p region for neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer is well established.</span> .... Molecular genetics and developmental studies have identified 21 genes in this region (ADRA1A, ARHGEF10, CHRNA2, CHRNA6, CHRNB3, DKK4, DPYSL2, EGR3, FGF17, FGF20, FGFR1, FZD3, LDL, NAT2, NEF3, NRG1, PCM1, PLAT, PPP3CC, SFRP1 and VMAT1/SLC18A1) t<span style="color:#FFFF40">hat are most likely to contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder and depression), neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) and cancer</span>. Furthermore,<span style="color:#FF0040"> at least seven nonprotein-coding RNAs (microRNAs) are located at 8p</span>. Structural variants on 8p, such as copy number variants, microdeletions or microduplications, might also contribute to autism, schizophrenia and other human diseases including cancer. In this review, we consider the current state of evidence from cytogenetic, linkage, association, gene expression and endophenotyping studies for the role of these 8p genes in neuropsychiatric disease. <span style="color:#FFFF40">We also describe how a mutation in an 8p gene (Fgf17) results in a mouse with deficits in specific components of social behavior and a reduction in its dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.</span> We finish by discussing the biological connections of 8p with respect to neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer, despite the shortcomings of this evidence.</div></blockquote>

Tokenizing the Kobe Bryant Autographed Black Mamba NFT Package webinair <a href="https://www.wisekey.com/wisekey-webinar/" class="postlink">https://www.wisekey.com/wisekey-webinar/</a><br>

A bit suggestive, isn't it?  I started watching the webinair but they are such dull fucks I couldn't watch for long <a href="https://youtu.be/gKIf-vtJhEQ" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/gKIf-vtJhEQ</a><br>

All they were talking about was how to make the most exclusive watches in the world.  The English guy is located at Hatton Gardens no less.  Kobe Bryant was suing big pharma before he died apparently. Weird.<br>
