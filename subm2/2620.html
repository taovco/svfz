<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Innova Medical Group has raked in £2.8billion from British taxpayers in controversial deals for lateral flow tests that give results within 30 minutes.  It was officially founded last March by Pasaca Capital, chaired by <span style="color:#FFFF40">Chinese businessman Charles Huang who was born in Wuhan</span> - the city at the epicentre of the pandemic - but has lived in the US for more than three decades.<br>
<br>
Innova's 'primary' factory for making coronavirus swabs is in Xiamen in Fujian. It also has three production facilities in the US, and is planning to expand to the UK.  The pharmaceutical's swabs will inevitably used as part of <span style="color:#FF0040">Boris Johnson</span>'s pledge to offer every adult in Britain two tests a week from Friday. But ministers are also hoping to start receiving swabs from UK companies - Omega Diagnostics and Global Access Diagnostics - as soon as their kits get the green light from the medical regulator. They will only be able to supply four million tests a week by the end of next month, compared to Innova's 15million a day..<br>
<br>
Innova's route to winning multi-million pound deals to supply Britain with Covid tests came through a Northamptonshire businessman, the Mail revealed last November. <span style="color:#FF0040">Kim Thonger, 61, of Wellingborough, is the UK distributor of Innova's tests, along with his 52-year-old co-director Charles Palmer, who he took on last summer.</span> ..Mr Thonger, who has no previous healthcare background and once worked for DKNY shoes and Dr Marten's, agreed to help Mr Elliott negotiate the bureaucracy and trials it had to go through to win its Government deal, it was claimed.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower Baku is an unfinished 33-floor hotel and condominium tower located in the Nasimi District in Baku, Azerbaijan. Construction began in 2008, when the project was initially planned as an apartment building. The project is owned by Baku XXI Century, a company affiliated with several members of the Mammadov family, which has been described as having a reputation for corruption.<br>
<br>
Businessman Donald Trump became involved with the unfinished project in May 2012, through his company, The Trump Organization. Trump announced his involvement with the project in November 2014, with plans to have the building opened as a hotel and condominium property in June 2015. Construction was delayed in 2015, and the project remained unfinished...<br>
<br>
Early History<br>
<br>
The project was announced as an apartment building in 2008, to be built along a road named Heydar Aliyev Prospekti, in Baku, Azerbaijan. Much of the property for the new project was occupied by numerous houses. The project's original budget was $195 million, although the price increased after several design revisions. The project was initially designed by a local architect, and its original design included a rooftop resembling the spikes of a crown.[1] <span style="color:#FF0040">Pierre Baillargeon and Mixity Design,[1] his London-based architecture firm, redesigned the project and removed the crown-roof aspect.</span>[1] The structure was designed as a curved building to resemble a sail, similar to the Burj Al Arab in Dubai.</div></blockquote>

<span style="color:#00FF40">Donald Trump’s Worst Deal </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal" class="postlink">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017 ... worst-deal</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..For an expensive hotel, the Trump Tower Baku is in an oddly unglamorous location: the underdeveloped eastern end of downtown, which is dominated by train tracks and is miles from the main business district, on the west side of the city. Across the street from the hotel is a discount shopping center; the area is filled with narrow, dingy shops and hookah bars. Other hotels nearby are low-budget options: at the AYF Palace, most rooms are forty-two dollars a night. There are no upscale restaurants or shops. Any guests of the Trump Tower Baku would likely feel marooned...<br>
<br>
The Azerbaijanis behind the project were close relatives of Ziya Mammadov, the Transportation Minister and one of the country’s wealthiest and most powerful oligarchs. According to the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, Azerbaijan is among the most corrupt nations in the world. Its President, Ilham Aliyev, the son of the former President Heydar Aliyev, recently appointed his wife to be Vice-President. Ziya Mammadov became the Transportation Minister in 2002, around the time that the regime began receiving enormous profits from government-owned oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. At the time of the hotel deal, Mammadov, a career government official, had a salary of about twelve thousand dollars, but he was a billionaire...<br>
<br>
The Trump Tower Baku originally had a construction budget of a hundred and ninety-five million dollars, but it went through multiple revisions, and the cost ended up being much higher. The tower was designed by a local architect, and in its original incarnation it had an ungainly roof that suggested the spikes of a crown. A<span style="color:#FF0040"> London-based architecture firm, Mixity, redesigned the building, softening its edges and eliminating the ornamental roof. </span>By the time the Trump team officially joined the project, in May, 2012, many condominium residences had already been completed; at the insistence of Trump Organization staffers, most of the building’s interior was gutted and rebuilt, and several elevators were added....<br>
<br>
Major hospitality brands compile exhaustive specifications for licensed hotels, and tend to approve design elements remotely; a foreign site is visited only occasionally. But in the case of Trump Tower Baku the oversight appears to have been extensive. The Azerbaijani lawyer told me, “We were always following their instructions. We were in constant contact with the Trump Organization. They approved the smallest details.” He said that Trump staff visited Baku at least monthly to give the go-ahead for the next round of work orders. Trump designers went to Turkey to vet the furniture and fabrics acquired there. <span style="color:#FF0040">The hotel’s main designer, Pierre Baillargeon, and several contractors told me that they had visited the Trump Organization headquarters, in New York, to secure approval for their plans.</span><br>
<br>
Ivanka Trump was the most senior Trump Organization official on the Baku project. In October, 2014, she visited the city to tour the site and offer advice. An executive at Mace, the London-based construction firm that oversaw the tower’s conversion to a hotel, met with Ivanka in Baku and New York...</div></blockquote>

I'm not speculating here what the Trumps were doing in Baku, I'm just laying down facts to try and work out wtf is going on in the world...<br>

I find the connections to Baku and the Mammadov family interesting because of this post:<br>

<span style="color:#00FF40">39 Dover Street - Gazelli Art House</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2902983/15489879" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatev ... 3/15489879</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Gazelli Art House was founded in 2003 in Baku, Azerbaijan...founder and director is Mila Askarova... Mila credits her mother Dr Hamzayeva (Dr Z) as inspiring her love of the arts from an early age. Mila started her career at Sotheby’s before moving on to work for one of London’s top galleries. ..<br>
<br>
Mila's London Favourites.. Soho Farmhouse, a members’ club in the Oxfordshire countryside..<br>
<br>
 Dr Hamzayeva (Dr Z)  is Zarifa Hamzayeva, the wife of the president of Azerbaijan's AZAL state airline company.. connected to SW Holding... along with Arzu Aliyeva, the 21-year-old daughter of the country's president, Ilham Aliyev  (The remaining owner and current majority stakeholder is Silkway Airlines LLC, which is registered abroad.)..The rise of SW Holding, which has seamlessly absorbed many of AZAL's former businesses, has raised questions about dubious privatization practices in Aliyev's Azerbaijan. It also serves to underscore how the political elite continues to use close friends and family members to preserve its hold on the country's most valuable assets -- despite Azerbaijani laws that list nepotism by state officials as an offense punishable by up to 12 years in jail.<br>
<br>
Ilham Aliyev likes to keep things in the family. It's a trend started by his father, Heydar, who ruled the country for 30 years before effectively handing the reins to his son before dying of a heart condition in 2003. Aliyev's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, is a parliament deputy and a prominent political figure in her own right.<br>
<br>
According to a report in "The Washington Post," the couple's preteen son, Heydar, last year became the legal owner of nine luxury mansions in Dubai purchased for some $44 million. Their daughters, Arzu and Leyla, also have Dubai property registered under the names. In total, the children's property holdings are estimated at $75 million.</div></blockquote>
