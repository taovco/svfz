Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) is a division of Johns Hopkins University based in Washington, D.C., United States, with campuses in Bologna, Italy, and Nanjing, China. It is consistently ranked one of the top graduate schools for international relations in the world. The institution is devoted to the study of international affairs, economics, diplomacy, and policy research and education.[1]<br>
<br>
Among the political scientists and economists affiliated with the school are former World Bank Chief Economist Anne Krueger and military historian and former Counselor of the United States Department of State Eliot Cohen...<br>

The SAIS Washington D.C. campus is located on Massachusetts Avenue NW's Embassy Row, just off Dupont Circle and across from the Brookings Institution and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and next to the Center for Global Development and the Peterson Institute.<br>

<br>
In June 2009, <span style="color:#FF0040">The Protection Project at SAIS partnered with the Koons Family Institute of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), creating the Child Protection Project</span>, to draft a model law focusing on the issues of child protection; in particular: "neglect, abuse, maltreatment, and exploitation". The primary objectives of the Child Protection Project are to "research existing child protection laws in the 193 member states of the United Nations (UN); convene a series of regional expert working group meetings to establish a common definition for 'child protection'; create a database of national legislation and case law on child protection issues from around the world; and draft, publish, and globally disseminate model child protection legislation".[17]<br>
<br>
The drafting process included six expert group meetings, held in Singapore, Egypt, Costa Rica, Spain, Turkey, and the U.S.[16] The final version of the Child Protection Model Law was published in January 2013. It was presented to the members of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">UN Committee on the Rights of the Child</span> during its 62nd Session in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2013.[16][18] It was also presented before the 129th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva in October 2013.[16][19][20] Accompanying the Child Protection Model Law, ICMEC and The Protection Project published a companion "100 Best Practices in Child Protection" guide in 2013..</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FFFF40">Svetlana Kuzmicheva-Uspenskaya, a Paris-based collector and philanthropist, founded Project Perpetual.</span> It is a privately funded initiative that harnesses the creative energy of the world’s leading contemporary artists and global influencers to raise funds and facilitate advocacy for high-risk children. Each project personally engages influencers in government, business, entertainment, and culture to part with an object of particular significance.<br>
<br>
Prominent artists then use these as inspiration to create unique works, transforming meaningful gestures into everlasting statements. For its inaugural edition, <span style="color:#FFFF40">Project Perpetual</span> will benefit ShotLife, a program of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">United Nations Foundation</span>. The ShotLife campaign came into existence when the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</span> asked the United Nations Foundation to lead a new campaign to build support for inoculation of under-fives wherever they are born...<br>
<br>
On November 9, Svetlana Kuzmicheva-Uspenskaya will host a gala dinner at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York. During dinner I will have the privilege of selling La Charité and the Koons Hermès bags at auction. The proceeds will go towards the United Nations Foundation...This is, to my knowledge, the first charity auction ever solely consisting of works done by a single artist. Jeff Koons is pioneering this new concept while following in the footsteps of Damien Hirst, who this year raised the bar of artist-led charity and generosity and took it to an entirely new level. In the May amfAR auction in Cannes and Leonardo DiCaprio’s auction in Saint Tropez—both of which I had the pleasure to conduct—Hirst’s works raised more than $20 million. It is wonderful to see that the strength of the global art market has its repercussions in the charity world.</div></blockquote>

David de Pury's ancestor is now a controversial figure in Switzerland as he was a slave trader : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_de_Pury" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_de_Pury</a><br>
<br>
David de Pury, Baron de Pury (19 January 1709 – 31 May 1786) was a banker, merchant, and philanthropist from the Principality of Neuchâtel, then a Prussian principality and now part of Switzerland. His involvement in Triangular trade, particularly diamond and precious wood trading between Europe and South America, earned him a vast fortune. He became a major benefactor for his home town, Neuchâtel, where he funded the construction of schools, hospitals, government buildings, and served as a patron of various local charities. <span style="color:#FFFF40">De Pury has become a controversial figure in the 21st-century for his connection to the Atlantic slave trade through his business endeavors in Latin America</span>.<br>

In his Nov. 9 speech at Cambridge, the Chief Justice Lord Lane cited the fact that 84 percent of all the heroin now seized en route to Great Britain originates with Afghani rebels operating from Pakistan and the Indian subcontinent. <span style="color:#FFFF40">This stream of heroin from the "Golden Crescent" is believed by security experts to reveal the footprints of a drugs-for-guns trafficking operation set up by Lord Carrington. In 1981 when· he was British Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington had sought· to oust U.S. intelligence control over the Afghani rebel movement, to gain a bargaining chip with the Soviets.</span><br>
<br>
Such arrangements are not new to Lord Carrington. Before becoming Foreign Secretary he sat at the center of British involvement in Dope, Inc., the $500 billion international illegal narcotics cartel. Carrington joined the board of Barclay's Bank, exposed in the 1978 book Dope, Inc. --&gt;&gt; Linked via DOPE Inc to Henry Kissinger and Bronfman Family as the premier British bank involved in multi-billion dollar offshore laundering of dirty money from drug trafficking and other organized crime activities. Barclay's is part of a nexus that includes the Oppenheimer family interests which cartelized international gold and diamond markets, the main commodities used in illegal drug and gun deals. The Oppenheimer interests, including Anglo-American Gold Company and De Beers, have made similar cartel arrangements for Soviet production of these commodities. At the time he joined Barclay's, Lord Carrington was on the board of Hambros Bank, which was involved in joint ventures <span style="color:#BFFF40">with the former Vatican banker Michele Sindona</span>, now imprisoned in the United States. His position with Hambros brought Lord Carrington into the circles of the<span style="color:#FFFF40"> Propaganda-2 masonic lodge of Italy</span>, pinpointed by Italian magistrates as responsible for every major coup attempt, assassination, and terrorist act since the late-1960s' NATO­linked "strategy of tension" in Italy.</div></blockquote></div>
