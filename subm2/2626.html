<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Royal controversies: Prince Philip shot a tiger in India the same year he became president of the World Wildlife Fund UK.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/qjsehm.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote> <span style="color:#FFFF80">26th January 1961: From left to right; Prince Philip (extreme left) with Prince Jagat-Singh (with his foot on tiger's head), the Maharajah of Jaipur, Queen Elizabeth II and the Maharanee of Jaipur. The tiger which was over 8ft long was shot by Prince Philip during a tiger hunt during the Royal Tour of India. The skin will be sent to Windsor Castle.</span>
</div></blockquote>

It is said that Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, who passed away at the age of 99 on Friday 9 April, made three memorable royal visits to India in his years of accompanying the monarch during her nearly 69-year reign. According to Business Standard, the UK’s longest-serving royal consort joined the Queen in India in 1961, 1983 and 1997 during which he made quite an impression with his sense of humour, which often also got him into some controversy. But apart from these quips, in 1961, the Queen and Prince Philip took part in a controversial tiger hunt on their visit to India....<br>
<br>
At the time, royal biographer Robert Hardman wrote in his book Queen of the World, that the Maharajah was very clear about the main purpose of the visit: The Duke of Edinburgh was going to shoot a tiger.  “At the very moment the Duke was in the process of establishing the World Wildlife Fund,” Hardman wrote. “Yet in the India of 1961, the tiger was still seen as a desirable pest and very desirable trophy. There was certainly no secrecy about the exercise. Day and night the Queen, the Duke and their hosts waited in a tree platform while 200 beaters scoured the jungle.”<br>
<br>
Biographer Robert added how there was also a backlash from the British media because of the buffalo used as bait. Never mind the crocodile and six mountain sheep he also gunned down during his visit.<br>
<br>
..TARGETING THE WWF<br>
Meanwhile, Prince Philip and the WWF was called out on the controversial hunt. In 2016, a blog piece stated: “Prince Philip apparently believes that conserving animals means keeping them around long enough for well-heeled ‘sportsmen’ to blast them out of the woods, oceans, skies, plains of Africa, and jungles of Asia.”<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">The article titled The WWF Endorses The Killing Of Wild Animals further stated that the WWF veils its true stance under phrases like “sustainable development,” arguing that “killing is acceptable under some circumstances”.</span> <a href="https://archive.is/sZLjl" class="postlink">https://archive.is/sZLjl</a></div></blockquote>

<br>
VANCOUVER, B.C. — A cease trade order was issued by the British Columbia Securities Commission on Feb. 8 against 222 Pizza (trading symbol PIZ.H) for failing to file comparative financial statements since last September...<br>
<br>
The low-volume stock most recently traded at CAN 1 cent per share. In 2002 the company had 10 units and relied on a fleet of trucks to deliver its pizzas. <span style="color:#FF0040">Chief executive Sarbjeet Mandair</span> told investors at the time that the company was deeply in debt and working with creditors to become solvent.</div></blockquote>

Of course we have a number of 222 Pizza Express posts, including:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#00FF40">Turning 222 Pizza Express Corp. into Gold!: A Frank Guistra Story.</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1653492" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1653492</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>So how does this connect?<br>
<br>
Pizza Express is named in the Hampstead case There was a Pizza Express in the Dupont Underground until it was unceremoniously closed in 1995. <span style="color:#FFFF40">The number 222 is inscribed on Corey Haim and Corey Feldman</span>... it seems to refer to the group of men who abused them, it was their "batch" number.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

I'll leave it there for now to move on to that pizzagate post later.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2008-04-24<br>
<br>
The Company announced today that it has completed the $1.5 million private placement previously announced on March 28, 2008. Under the terms of the financing, the Company issued an aggregate of 30,000,000 units, at a price of $0.05 cents per unit. Each unit consists of one common share and one warrant exercisable for one additional common share at a price of $0.10 per share, for a period of one year.<br>
<br>
Endeavour Financial has been issued 1.5 million units as a finder's fee on monies raised in the private placement.<br>
<br>
The Company also settled $500,000 in outstanding debt through the issuance of 10 million common shares at a deemed price of $0.05 per share. All securities issued in the private placement and debt settlement are subject to a hold period expired on August 22, 2008.<br>
<br>
The Company also announces the appointment of Jeff Durno as President and a Director of the Company. Mr. Durno is the managing partner of Anfield Sujir Kennedy &amp; Durno, a Vancouver law firm focusing on corporate and securities law, and is Chairman of Emprise Capital Corporation, a Vancouver based merchant banking firm which has assisted the Company in its restructuring. <span style="color:#FF0040">Sarbjeet Mandair has resigned from his positions with the Company.</span> The Company also announces that it has agreed to grant options to purchase an aggregate of 50,000 shares, at a price of $0.35 per share, exercisable for a period of six months.<br>
<br>
The Radcliffe Foundation of Vancouver, BC has subscribed for 820,000 units of the private placement and has received 5,000,000 shares on the completion of the debt settlement transaction. The Radcliffe Foundation now holds 6,980,000 common shares, representing 11.97% of the Company's outstanding capital. It also owns an additional 820,000 share purchase warrants. <span style="color:#FF0040">Mr. Frank Giustra of West Vancouver, BC, controls the Radcliffe Foundation and has personally subscribed for 1,800,000 units of the private placement. Mr. Giustra now holds 4,600,000 common shares of the Company.</span> When combined with the holdings of the Radcliffe Foundation, Mr. Giustra controls an aggregate of 11,580,000 common shares representing 19.86% of the Company's outstanding capital. Mr. Giustra also owns personally, an additional 1,800,000 share purchase warrants. Assuming the exercise of all warrants held by Mr. Giustra and the Foundation, Mr. Giustra would then own or control an aggregate of 14,200,000 common shares, representing 23.31% of the Company's then outstanding capital.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The Company is advised that the securities were acquired by the Radcliffe Foundation and Mr. Giustra for investment purposes.</span> While they do not currently have any intention to acquire further securities of the Company, the Radcliffe Foundation or Mr. Giustra may in the future acquire or dispose of securities of the Company, through the market or otherwise, as circumstances or market conditions warrant. -- <a href="http://www.cnxmarketlink.com" class="postlink">www.cnxmarketlink.com</a></div></blockquote></div>

<br>
VANCOUVER, B.C. -- Struggling with debt and slow sales, 222 Pizza Express CEO Sarbjeet Mandair wrote in a recent investor release that his company is pursuing extended negotiations with creditors, cutting its corporate staff to three and postponing a new menu rollout.<br>
<br>
According to the release, Mandair wrote, "As previously announced, we remain focused on reducing our ongoing liabilities to an affordable level. ... Due to a shortage of funds and manpower, plans to try a new food menu and catering program has been postponed to late September or early October. By October 2003, we hope to have a much smaller but profitable model of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Pizza 222 Express system</span>."

American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers took Dante's to court in November 2018 for copyright infringement for unauthorized public performance of ASCAP members' creative work. According to ASCAP, it has made numerous attempts to contact the venue prior to legal actions.[3][4]<br>

The late-night delivery pizza spot inside Dante's on West Burnside Street was made famous for including edible glitter among its toppings and art in every box, not to mention its part ownership by <span style="color:#FFFF40">Mini-Marilyn Manson, aka Nik Sin.</span><br>

According to Dante's owner Frank Faillace, Lonesome's gave a mere week's notice before Dante's had to take back over its pizza window. They're now calling the window Pizza Slut....<br>
<br>
First co-owner Noah Antieu's face was X-ed out on the "Lonesome's Pizza" mural, while a heart was drawn with an arrow pointing to Sin. Now, only Sin is pictured on the wall. (Sin also emcees at Faillace's neighboring strip club, Kit Kat Club.) The <span style="color:#FF0040">Lonesome's Pizza site currently redirects to a donation page for Planned Parenthood.</span> Antieu, on his Instagram, wrote that he's now starting a cannabis marketing company.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the kind people at Portland Reddit were incensed, and peppered the Pizza Slut Facebook page with outrage that Pizza Slut posted a series of tongue-in-cheek five-star reviews of themselves on Facebook, before the restaurant had even opened.<br>
<br>
Sample from owner Faillace: "I want to rub it all over my body but it's already inside my body. Is that weird?" Sample from the longtime Satyricon and Dante's sound guy Stevie Mickelson: "They make the best pizza in the world.  <span style="color:#FFFF40">It's so good that Macauley Culkin is putting his band "The Pizza Underground" back together so he can share it with everyon</span>e."

Portland, Oregon- back in the 80-90's there was a gay club called the Old City Night Club.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In its heyday, the City Nightclub functioned somewhere between Studio 54 and Outside In, a space in which kids who had no place else to go could explore and exert their identities. Search for the City online, though, and what little pops up will often refer to the club as "infamous" or "notorious." Hounded by police and then-Mayor Vera Katz, and beset by accusations ranging from pervasive drug use on the premises to a child pornography ring operating out of its basement, the City, which moved from downtown to the pre-Pearl District during its lifetime, closed in the late '90s, and is remembered less vividly today as an icon of Old Weird Portland than other alleged dens of iniquity like Satyricon.</div></blockquote>

Portland gay activist Lanny Swerdlow explains that in 1977, he tried to create a safe meeting place for gays who were too young to patronize bars. The youth had been congregating at “camp”, an outdoor area generally around SW Yamhill and Third Avenue. There were as many as 100 kids hanging out there at a time, something that upset others in the area.   </div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Prince of Wales yesterday formally unveiled a statue to Britain's first Sikh settler, Maharajah Duleep Singh, the last ruler of the Sikh kingdom of Punjab.<br>
<br>
The bronze statue was unveiled on Butten Island in Thetford, Norfolk, near the Elveden Estate where the maharajah lived the remainder of his life after being exiled to Britain in 1849 at the age of 14...<br>
<br>
The maharajah was dethroned in 1849, after ruling the Punjab for six years, when the British annexed the country following the Anglo-Sikh wars.<br>
<br>
In Britain he became a friend of Queen Victoria, who was godmother to several of his children, and gave her the Koh-i-noor diamond, which is the centrepiece of the Queen Mother's state crown. The maharajah spent most of his time at the Elveden Estate in Suffolk, where he died and was buried in 1893.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Maharaja Duleep Singh (4 September 1838 – 22 October 1893), also known as His Highness Maharaja Sir Duleep Singh, GCSI, or Sir Dalip Singh[1] and later in life nicknamed the "Black Prince of Perthshire",[2] was the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire. He was Maharaja Ranjit Singh's youngest son, the only child of Maharani Jind Kaur...<br>
<br>
He was placed in power in September 1843, at the age of five, with his mother ruling on his behalf, and after their defeat in the Sikh Anglo War, under a British Resident. He was subsequently kidnapped by the British Crown, and thereafter exiled to Britain at age 15 where he was befriended by Queen Victoria, who is reported to have written of the Punjabi Maharaja: "Those eyes and those teeth are too beautiful".[4] The Queen was godmother to several of his children.[5] He died young, living most of his final years in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>
Early years<br>
<br>
After the close of the Second Anglo-Sikh War and the subsequent annexation of the Punjab on 29 March 1849,[11] he was deposed at the age of ten[12] and was put into the care of Dr John Login and sent from Lahore to Fatehgarh on 21 December 1849, with tight restrictions on who he was allowed to meet. No Indians, except trusted servants, could meet him in private. As a matter of British policy, he was to be anglicised in every possible respect...<br>
<br>
Elveden Estate<br>
Maharaja Duleep Singh (as he became in June 1861) bought (or the India Office purchased for him) a 17,000 acres (69 km2) country estate at Elveden on the border between Norfolk and Suffolk, close to Thetford, in 1863. He enjoyed living in Elveden Hall and the surrounding area and restored the church, cottages, and school. He transformed the run-down estate into an efficient game preserve and it was here that he gained his reputation as the fourth best shot in England.[20][21][22]<br>
<br>
Elveden Church 1909: Graves of Maharaja Duleep Singh, his wife Maharani Bamba and son Prince Edward Albert Duleep Singh<br>
The house was remodelled into a quasi-oriental palace where he lived the life of a British aristocrat.[23] Maharaja Duleep Singh was accused of running up large expenses and the estate was sold after his death to pay his debts. <span style="color:#FF0040">Today, Elveden is owned by The 4th Earl of Iveagh, the head of the Anglo-Irish Guinness family of brewing fame; it remains an operating farm and private hunting estate.</span><br>
<br>
...<span style="color:#FF0080">In 1854, Madame Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophical Society, met her Master Morya in England, who was in her words, "in the company of a dethroned native prince". This "native prince" according to general consent was Sir Duleep Singh.</span>... He was a member of the Freemasons and was admitted into the lodge in 1861.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>At a Supreme Court hearing on the Kohinoor issue on Monday, Solicitor-General Ranjit Kumar surprisingly stated on behalf of the Culture Ministry that “the diamond was neither stolen nor forcibly taken away”. Instead, Kumar claimed, the stone had been “gifted” to the East India Company by the former rulers of the Punjab. ... How could the Solicitor-General come up with his narrative, which is dramatically at odds with the records of Punjabi history...<br>
<br>
One document in particular sealed the fate of Maharaja Duleep Singh, the Sikh Empire and the Kohinoor diamond in one fell swoop: the 1849 Treaty of Lahore. This treaty was presented to the Maharaja to sign after the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848-9, at a moment when an anti-British rebellion by Punjabi soldiers and ‘sardars’ had been clinically suppressed by the Company. This was a rebellion in which the boy king had himself played no part, but for which he was made to suffer the consequences, as the then Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, had decided that he would no longer allow the troublesome nature of Punjabi independence to thwart British imperial ambitions in India.</div></blockquote>

...While Victoria wore the diamond as a brooch, it eventually became part of the Crown Jewels, first in the crown of Queen Alexandra (the wife of Edward VII, Victoria’s oldest son) and then in the crown of Queen Mary (the wife of George V, grandson of Victoria). The diamond came to its current place of honor in 1937, at the front of the crown worn by the Queen Mother, wife of George VI and mother of Elizabeth II. The crown made its last public appearance in 2002, resting atop of the coffin of the Queen Mother for her funeral...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>No 1 Poultry[a] is a building in the City of London, allocated to office and commercial use. It occupies the apex where the eastern ends of Poultry and Queen Victoria Street meet at Mansion House Street, the western approach to Bank junction...<br>
<br>
The design, by James Stirling, was constructed after the architect's death. It replaced a neogothic, conical-turretted, predecessor retail building, <span style="color:#FFFF40">owned by developer Rudolph Palumbo and subsequently by his son, developer Peter Palumbo</span>. Another option was a modernist minor skyscraper designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in the manner of the Seagram Building in New York City – but dropped having failed in an influential architectural and planning show-down in the 1970s. The tall but less towering design, in a postmodernist style with an outer shell of even bands of rose-pink and muted yellow stone, prevailed. The point of the apex, as before, has a clock face but higher, as above a large pointed apex set of 30 window panes.<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">The rooftop restaurant was used for the apparent Queen's helicopter departure point in the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.</span><br>
<br>
..Like many notable postmodern buildings, the imagery is rich in references. For example, from the sharp apex of the site a keyhole-shaped opening leads to a little-seen Scala Regia with a ramped floor, gold-leafed terminus and ancient Egyptian aura takes visitors into the heart of the building. Intended as site owner Palumbo's private entrance, this space is now little used: Palumbo sold the development before its completion. The turret above is sometimes likened to a submarine conning tower while the glazed thus two-sided clock is in concept and detail that of the Art Deco era Palazzo delle Poste, Naples...<br>
<br>
As to the apex facing Mansion House, a Conservation Area, to rebuild <span style="color:#FFFF40">drew much opposition</span> particularly as standing there, <span style="color:#FFFF40">in repairable condition, was a 19th-century neo-gothic listed building occupied by crown jewellers Mappin and Webb.</span></div></blockquote>

England had a tight rein on India and the rajahs: <br>
<br>
 "Sawai Man Singh II, known in the family as Jai, was only ten years old so the British moved in to insure he grew up as they wanted him to grow up. They took a special interest in his sex life. His guardian recommended that to avoid repression and venereal diseases, from about the age of 15 Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II should “associate with a healthy young girl, and that in moderation”. But the pull of Rajput tradition proved too powerful and he was married to a princess from the Jodhpur Royal family at the age of 12. The British saw to it that they were not allowed to cohabit for several years.<br>
<br>
The anglicising  programme continued, with Jai being sent to Mayo College modelled on the British public school system. That was followed by a year’s military training in Britain. The British were so concerned about keeping Jai on their side, and being able to keep his people on their side too, that the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, presided over his investiture on the Jaipur throne."<br>

<br>
Jagat's mother Ayesha was well connected to English VIPS:<br>
Sociable to the last, as recently as June, the Rajmata had co-hosted with Sir Evelyn de Rothschild and Sarah, Duchess of York, a fund-raising party in London for Elephant Family, a charity to save the Asian elephant run by Mark Shand, the Prince of Wales' brother-in-law. Shand was probably the Rajmata's best friend in Britain; he named his only child, Ayesha, after her.<br>
<br>
Prince Philip, a fellow player, became a friend as was his uncle, Lord Mountbatten. They spent time abroad in Grosvenor Square in London and on their estates in East Sussex and Berkshire as Jai's sons, and later his and Ayesha's son, Jagat , followed him to Harrow<br>

<br>
Wonder how "friendly" did it get with Mountbatten who allegedly like young boys in uniform and Amal wrote that Dickie would express his liking for “dark-skinned” boys, “especially Sri Lankans”.<br>

<span style="color:#00FF40">PROPOSED AIRPORT HOTEL — DEBATE COMMENCED —FURTHER CONSIDERATION ADJOURNED</span> <a href="https://archive.is/KHel3" class="postlink">https://archive.is/KHel3</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..That Tynwald authorises the Department of Tourism and Transport toprovide financial assistance towards the cost of building a 100-bedroom hotelat Ronaldsway airport by way of a conditional grant not exceeding 35 percent. of the approved cost of the project or £1,560,000, whichever is the lesser..<br>
<br>
..When we were approached by Novotel, we felt that they were the best organisationto manage the proposed hotel. Novotel are part of the <span style="color:#BF0040">Accor Group</span> which is a Frenchholding company quoted on the French stock market with a capitalisation of U.S.$1 million. It is currently ranked as the eighth largest hotel and leisure group internationally..<br>
<br>
Equally important the group also owns a range of companies associated with thehotel and leisure industries, such as tour operating companies, hotel supplycompanies, an international reservation system, Resinta, and<span style="color:#FF0040"> Accor</span> also runs a stafftraining academy in Paris..<br>
<br>
If the scheme is given the go-ahead it will be open in time for the 1991 seasonand will be well established in time for the arrival of 1992 and the Single EuropeanMarket, giving us a good marketing presence in the E.C. for the first time. Thisshould bring great benefits not only to the hotel industry but also to the financeand business sections...As far as the choice of site is concerned, this was the first and ultimately onlychoice of Novotel. They visited all of the available sites on the Island, includingthe Villiers site, but were finally quite adamant that the airport site was the onlyacceptable one which fitted their corporate strategy, and I have to emphasis thatpoint, Your Excellency.<br>
<br>
The developing company is to be <span style="color:#FFFF40">Land and Property Trust Company (Isle ofMan) Ltd</span>., a Manx registered company which was established purely to undertakethe development of the airport hotel and has not yet traded. At present there isonly nominal capitalisation but prior to any development it will be substantiallycapitalised by the U.K. parent Land and Property Trust Company P.L.C. with thelevel of capitalisation approved by the Treasury, and I would inform hon. membersthat the Treasury and Economic Adviser's Department have been closely involvedwith these negotiations from a very early stage. The negotiations have not simplybeen carried out by the Tourist Department.Land and Property Trust Company, which until November 1988 was named LandInvestors P.L.C. is a major U.K. property development and management company.Its issued share capital comprises 75 million 25p shares and its net assets at the 24thMarch 1987 were £57 million. In November 1987 the Financial Times survey quotedthe company as number 377 in its survey of the top 500 companies in Britain. <span style="color:#FF0040">The chairman and major shareholder in the company is Berish Berger</span> who purchased his interest at an estimated cost of £254 million. <span style="color:#FF0040">The Managing Director is Lawrence Bloom who was once the founding partner in Bloom, King, Main, the successfulCity agents of the 1970s</span><br>
<br>
.....................<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mr. Leventhorpe</span>: Your Excellency, once again this hon. Court is being asked at short notice, very short notice, to vote a large sum of money for a project about which, despite the brochure produced by the Department of Tourism and Transport,we know very little, and if Government departments wish this hon. Court to votesuch substantial sums, then it is surely their duty to provide the fullest information......<br>
<br>
So what do we know? We do know that this scheme has been around for almostthree years and was, in conjunction with a large office complex, rejected some twoyears ago. We are given some further information. An option on this land wasapparently given by the D.H.P.P. When was this given? How long ago? For howlong? How much money passed for it? On whose authority? And was a questionof a lease considered? We know nothing...<br>
<br>
...We are also told that feasibility studies have been carried out, but we are notgiven any information on them. That information surely is not so classified thatit could not be made available to hon. members. The Treasury and the Departmentof Tourism seem to have accepted assumptions made therein..<br>
<br>
..We are also told that it will advance the cause of tourism. The Novotel chainis largely aimed at the business community, not at tourism...We are also told, Your Excellency, that there is a Novotel in Guernsey. Do wehave to have the same, then? All right, but let it be on the same terms, and to thebest of my understanding no Government money, no subsidy, went into that hotelin Guernsey, nothing at all...<br>
<br>
Your Excellency, I turn to Schedule 1 of the tourist brochure where <span style="color:#FFFF40">we are referred to Land and Property Trust Company P.L.C. It does not exist. There is a Land and Property Trust Company. It was taken over in May 1986 by a consortium held as to 51 per cent. by Reliable Properties and 49 per cent. by Mr. Berger, who is mentioned, and a Mr. Garrard.</span> They paid £75 million for the company; it was a substantial company...in June of last year that company was in fact re-named from Land Investors,which is what it used to be, to Land and Property Trust, and it was bought outfrom Reliable Properties by Mr. Berger and his friend and it is now a wholly ownedsubsiduary of a private company called B.C.P.H. So we are not dealing with a stockexchange-quoted company with all the benefits of help and backing from somethinglike the Monopolies and Mergers Commission or the Office of Fair Trading. Weare dealing with an individual's private company with all the implications that that has for it..<br>
<br>
we are also told that it was numbered 377 on the F.T. list in November '87.Well I have looked that up and it was Beihaven Breweries at that time, was 377,and neither Land Investors, Land and Property Trust Limited, Reliable Propertiesor B.C.P.H. figure in that list

April 11, 2008<br>
A North London rabbi has won a High Court claim to be repaid more than £322,000 by a strictly Orthodox charity which he says was intended as a loan, not a gift.<br>

In the late 1950s, Arnold Spielberg, the father of Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, helped revolutionize computing when he designed the GE-225 mainframe computer.

Henton and Spielberg's father, Arnold, served together in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II in the 490th Bomb Squadron stationed in India and Burma....Their history goes back a generation, to World War II, where Henton and Arnold Spielberg, Steven's father, served in the 490th Bomb Squadron in Burma and India, part of the war's China-Burma-India Theater. Henton served there for 2½ years in administration, doing payroll, courts martial and the worst task - writing to inform families that a loved one was killed in action.<br>
