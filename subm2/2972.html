Oriel, the recruitment outsourcing business, has changed its brand identity to Outsauce.<br>
<br>
The company, which provides financing, back office support, accounting and contracting services for recruitment agencies and contractors, has operated from its head office in Cheltenham since 2000. Taken over in January by private equity business, Energize Capital, Oriel installed Miles Lloyd, experienced senior recruitment agency executive and non-exec director of The Recruitment Society, as CEO the same month.<br>
<br>
Since then the business has undergone a period of restructuring and significant growth, with the opening of a second office in Manchester and a series of new client wins.<br>
<br>
The rebrand to Outsauce is the next step in defining the new direction for the business, says Miles Lloyd.. This team now includes ex-Pay Matters and Brookson duo, Andrew Webster and Paul Crossley, who have joined Outsauce to drive growth of the company’s contracting business and accounting service for sole traders and one man limited companies (PSCs). With a new Best Advice Matrix designed to provide contractors with all of the necessary information to make the most appropriate and compliant decision on their employment status, Outsauce can then provide umbrella or accountancy support to help them maximise their take home pay and keep on top of their HMRC obligations...<br>

<br>
Kathleen Saxton has, in a surprise move, shut her executive search firm, The Lighthouse Company, and joined strategic advisory firm MediaLink as executive vice-president and managing director to lead its European operations...<br>
<br>
Saxton has been one of the most visible leaders in the UK advertising and media scene as the chief executive of The Lighthouse Company, which she founded in 2009, and the advisory chair of Advertising Week Europe, which she co-founded in 2013.<br>
<br>
In her new role, which she started on 1 September, Saxton reports to Michael Kassan, founder, chairman and chief executive of MediaLink. She will also work with British parent company, Ascential, which owns Cannes Lions.<br>
<br>
Her remit will be wide-ranging, spanning business growth, agency selection, talent advisory and strategic consulting for clients. She is also expected to bring her skills to bear as a qualified psychotherapist. MediaLink is a leading player in the US but it has yet to make a major impact in the UK since being acquired by Ascential in 2017...<br>
<br>
Companies House filings show Saxton wound up The Lighthouse Ventures in July, after paying staff who were made redundant. It is understood that she retains the company’s IP and brand...</div></blockquote>

<br>
A millionaire businessman has silenced critics who passed comments on his divorce settlement by publishing the details on the internet.<br>
<br>
Gary Dean, 47, of St Michaels, Fylde in Lancashire, said gossips who branded him "tight" forced him to reveal his payout after leaving wife Helen.<br>
<br>
Mr Dean set up the website, The Truth About Helen Louise Dean Vs Gary Dean, to set the record straight.<br>
<br>
The pair, who have four children, divorced after 19 years of marriage.<br>
On the site, Mr Dean states, "Over the course of the last year I have been subject to gossip about my divorce, some of it just silly tittle-tattle, and some of it malicious...<br>
<br>
Mr Dean said he had been painted as "tight" and "greedy" who "abandoned my wife and children, walking off with millions and leaving my family almost destitute".<br>
<br>
"It's simply not true at all and I've decided that instead of allowing the rumour-mill to continue churning out nonsense I'd just set out the actual facts to stop it," he said...</div></blockquote>

On his CV he says he's CEO of the Elletson Group.. I can't find a website for them but there is an Elletson family.. a very interesting one...</div>

Held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, in aid of Action For Addiction and this year chaired by Lady Arnold, herself addicted to champagne and marmalade, it is always one of the most amusing charity balls. Essentially, it is a children's party for crinklies. Clowns, bears and jesters walked among the guests, encouraging them to try, among other things, the shooting range, coconut shy and wobbly bicycles. The bravest girls hurled themselves down the helter skelter, landing in a heap with their taffetas around their waists. When dinner was announced, a waggish MC elicited howls of dismay when he told guests that all staircases had been closed off and the only way down was on the helter skelter. The ballroom had been turned into a multi-coloured big top and on the tables live goldfish in bowls goggled at the diners.

In an article published by the Dailymail and Mail on Sunday in 2007, which possibly has been deleted and removed from archives on a D-Notice,[6] Mr Elletson is mentioned to have been visiting Baku in 1993 as a guest of BP, at a time when many lucrative deals were made in the former soviet territory. The title of the article was: "Hookers, spies, cases full of dollars...how BP spent Ł45m to win 'Wild East' oil rights".<br>
<br>
Elletson was listed as the point person for a meeting on Thursday 15th March 2018 at the Institute for Statecraft HQ in London, according to a draft event document leaked from the Integrity Initiative. The guest was scheduled to be Donald Duke, former Governor of Cross Rivers State, Nigeria.<br>
<br>
"Round Table Discussion: Mr Duke is very likely to be a candidate in the next presidential elections in Nigeria and is keen to discuss both the situation in West Africa, relations with Britain and Europe, and wider political issues (eg terrorism, corruption, fraud etc)."..<br>

Harold Elletson is an intriguing figure.  There is no background information on him but he lives in Lancashire, the seat of the Elletson family.. So, I'll continue with him until I work out one way or another if he's connected to the other Elletsons... returning to the Wikispooks article on him and Baku:<br>

Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.. an article on the Anders Breivik massacre in Norway by Harold Elletson: <a href="http://www.newsecuritylearning.com/index.php/comment/137-uncomfortable-questions-for-norway" class="postlink">http://www.newsecuritylearning.com/inde ... for-norway</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Norway is still grieving after the appalling slaughter on the island of Utoya and in Oslo. There is, however, an urgent need to ask what may prove to be some very uncomfortable questions both about the genesis of the attacks and, unfortunately, about the competence of Norway’s police and security establishment in responding to them. These are important questions and lessons must be learned quickly in Norway and elsewhere, about intelligence, planning, preparedness, training and response.<br>
<br>
..Scenario planning can be improved by computer modelling; crisis management, decision-making and exercising can all benefit from the use of simulation and gaming; and both overall coordination and information-sharing have been made much easier by new forms of communication. Many police forces have taken advantage of technological innovations to develop imaginative new training solutions. ..

An all-party pressure group wants to devolve and re-create the ancient kingdom of fearsome viking Erik Bloodaxe.<br>

<span style="color:#FF0040">The Campaign for the North, chaired by former Tory MP Harold Elletson</span>, wants ‘devo-max’ power from Westminster to bring the traditional counties of Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Westmorland and Cumberland into one democratic state with powers equal to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or London.<br>
<br>
The kingdom was ruled a thousand years ago by the Norseman Erik Bloodaxe, the last ‘king of the North’.<br>
<br>
A fearsome invader from the age of just 12 the viking Erik eventually fell in the battle of Stainmore, high in the Pennines in 954. He secured his crown by murdering his brothers.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Harold Elletson, Conservative MP for Blackpool North 1992-1997, said at his Lancashire home </span>:<br>
<br>
“It’s time for the North. England needs to embrace the reality of devolution within the United Kingdom and adopt a federal system. ‘Devo-max’ could give the North a new beginning. We should govern ourselves, raise taxes from our own resources and make all the important decisions – about education, health, transport and our economy – here in the North.<br>
<br>
The Campaign commissioned The Case for the North, a study of the potential benefits of a Northern parliament that would govern 15 million people, a constituency as big as the successful German federal states, created after the Second World War by British planners roughly the size of Bavaria.</div></blockquote>
