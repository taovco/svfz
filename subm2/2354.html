			<div class="content">I have no time today to get into this story in-depth so I'm quickly recording some basic connections.<br>
<br>
This story started when I was looking up more about Nicole Junkermann, her connections to Matt Hancock and the global healthtech network which I'll expand on in another post.  That lead me to an organisation called<span style="color:#FFFF40"> London Model WHO Simulation</span> which started back in 2017.  <br>
<br>
LonWHO 2017 <a href="https://www.ukwho.org/lonwho-2017" class="postlink">https://www.ukwho.org/lonwho-2017</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Model WHO conferences are educational simulations in which participants recreate the process of the annual World Health Assembly. The focus of each conference lies in addressing a specific global health issue at the local, national and international levels, with delegates taking on this task from the perspective of their chosen role..<br>
<br>
Whilst our cohort brought together students and professionals alike, hailing from multiple disciplines, they were united by a budding interest in or longstanding passion for policy and public health. Having met through the international Model WHO community in 2015, Co-Founders Brian Wong (MSc Epidemiology Class of 2017) and Claire Brash (Imperial College London School of Medicine), realised the benefits that Model WHO brings for global public health education and career development. Through the support of <span style="color:#FFFF40">Professor Peter Piot (LSHTM Director)</span> and Nicola Quilter (LSHTM Events), their dream of bringing Model WHO to London became a reality.</div></blockquote>

In 2019 the overarching theme <span style="color:#FFFF40">Conflict and Health: Policy for Global Action.</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Peter Karel Piot, Baron Piot, KCMG, FRCP, FMedSci (born 17 February 1949)[1] is a Belgian microbiologist known for his research into Ebola and AIDS. Piot is the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.<br>
<br>
After helping discover the Ebola virus in 1976 and leading efforts to contain the first-ever recorded Ebola epidemic that same year, Piot became a pioneering researcher into AIDS. He has held key positions in the United Nations and World Health Organization involving AIDS research and management. He has also served as a professor at several universities worldwide.<br>
<br>
..In 1976, while working at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Piot was part of a team that observed a Marburg-like virus in a sample of blood taken from a sick nun working in Zaire.[4][5] Piot and his colleagues subsequently traveled to Zaire as part of an International Commission set up by the Government of Zaire to help quell the outbreak..<br>
<br>
 The events were dramatised by Mike Walker on BBC Radio 4 in December 2014 in a production by David Morley. Piot narrated the programme.<br>
<br>
In the 1980s, Piot participated in a series of collaborative projects in Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zaire. Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Zaire was the first international project on AIDS in Africa and is widely acknowledged as having provided the foundations of science's understanding of HIV infection in Africa. He was a professor of microbiology, and of public health at the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine, in Antwerp</span>, and at the University of Nairobi, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, the Lausanne, and a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. He was also a Senior Fellow at the University of Washington in Seattle, a Scholar in <span style="color:#FFFF40">Residence at the Ford Foundation, and a Senior Fellow at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</span></div></blockquote>

RUSSIA ACCUSES BILL GATES OF INFECTING CONGOLESE VILLAGERS WITH EBOLA <a href="https://secretsofaidsandebola.blogspot.com/2017/06/vladimir-putin-accuses-bill-gates-of.html" class="postlink">https://secretsofaidsandebola.blogspot. ... es-of.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>According to the leaked confidential Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report that has been read by sources in the Kremlin, it has been revealed that the virus was created by “world governments and non-government organizations.” It is understood the chief non-government organization behind the Ebola virus is Bill Gates’ own Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.<br>
<br>
President Putin is said to be “disturbed by the potential for worldwide harm.” There have been meetings in the past 24 hours regarding further sanctions on Bill Gates and his front companies, as well as plans to protect humanity from the “one man eugenics movement.”<br>
<br>
In 2016 President Putin banned Gates and his company Microsoft from Russia, citing security and privacy fears. Though dismissed as “paranoid” and “weird” by Western media at the time, WikiLeaks revelations in 2017 regarding collusion between the CIA, Microsoft and Silicon Valley tech companies have proved Putin was one step ahead of the game. In 2015 Bill Gates teamed up with Hollywood star Ben Affleck to request more money and freedom for the Gates Foundation to perform experiments in the Congo and other developing nations.

The first dose of the VSV-Ebola vaccine was administered to a health worker on Wednesday December 17, 2014 at the Kilifi County Hospital...<br>
<br>
hese trials are led by Dr. Patricia Njuguna, Dr Benjamin Tsofa and Prof. Phillip Bejon who are the Principal investigators. Explaining the approval process the Director KEMRI Prof. Solomon Mpoke said “The approvals were fast-tracked by KEMRI and the Pharmacy and Poisons Board so that a 6 to 7 months approval process was conducted in only 6 weeks” He also noted that while the VACCINE TRIALS WERE BEING FAST-TRACKED the safety of the VOLUNTEERS would remain key.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, or just Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), is an American non-profit organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It focuses on major health care issues facing the nation, as well as U.S. role in global health policy... <span style="color:#FFFF40">KFF worked with UNAIDS in 2004 to launch the Global Media AIDS Initiative at the United Nations</span> to mobilize media in response to the global AIDS pandemic..<br>
<br>
Under Greater Than AIDS – a national public information response to the U.S. epidemic launched in 2009 – KFF works with a broad cross section of public and private partners[16] to increase knowledge, reduce stigma and promote actions to stem the spread of HIV.<br>

The Kaiser Family Foundation previously funded professorial chairs at UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University, named the Henry J. Kaiser Professorships.<br>

Jim Doyle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Doyle" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Doyle</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Doyle ran against Republican Scott McCallum, the former lieutenant governor who had assumed the office of governor in 2001 after Tommy Thompson left to become Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Bush administration.<br>
<br>
The 2002 governor's race is considered by some to have been the most negative campaign in the state's history...During the campaign, Doyle was dogged by charges that Georgia Thompson, a state employee, had steered a travel agency contract to a firm whose principals had donated $20,000 to his campaign. Thompson was convicted in federal court in late 2006 and sentenced to 18 months in prison.[6] The conviction was reversed by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2007, with one judge calling the U.S. Attorney's case "beyond thin"..<br>
<br>
Doyle's stated priorities were investing in public schools, including the University of Wisconsin system; lowering property taxes; regional economic development; transportation reform; <span style="color:#FF0040"><strong class="text-strong">and funding of stem cell research.</strong></span></div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Project SIDA (1984–1991), or Projet SIDA ("Project AIDS" in French), was a joint scientific project between Zaire, the United States, and Belgium to study AIDS in Central Africa. Headquartered in Kinshasa, Zaire (DRC), Projet SIDA was designed as a collaboration between foreign scientists with experience studying epidemics and local scientists and physicians familiar with the local culture and customs. Initiated in 1984, Project SIDA began under the direction of Jonathan Mann with funding from the U.S. and Belgium, as well as support from the Zairian government. Project SIDA was based at Mama Yemo (Kinshasa General) hospital in Kinshasa.<br>
<br>
Early on, Projet SIDA researchers confirmed the presence of AIDS outside of the United States through laboratory testing of blood samples collected by Kapita. Unlike in the United States, where most identified AIDS cases were male, Projet SIDA identified an equal number of male and female AIDS patients at Mama Yemo. Thus, the project was one of the first to establish the heterosexual transmission of AIDS...<br>
<br>
Dr. Bila Kapita was the first to notice the beginnings of the AIDS epidemic in Zaire..homas Quinn of National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Joseph McCormick of the Centers for Disease Control, and <span style="color:#FFFF40">Peter Piot of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp</span> went on a fact-finding mission Kinshasa in the summer of 1983 at the request of Kalisa Ruti, the Zaire Minister of Health..<br>
<br>
In Kinshasa, Kapita introduced Quinn, McCormick, and Piot to 38 patients in Kinshasa and provided samples he had collected of their blood. Many of these patients displayed Cryptococcal meningitis, which is often linked to AIDS.[2] Kaptita, McCormick, and Piot, as well as Sheila Mitchell of the CDC, identified the loss of t-cells in Kapita's patients.[3] The initial 1983 work done in Mama Yemo, along with research done by Belgian physician Nathan Clumeck in Kigali, Rwanda and cell counts of blood collected in Rwanda by the Pasteur Institute, established the connection between North American AIDS and the disease present in Central Africa</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Jonathan Max Mann (July 30, 1947 – September 2, 1998) was an American physician who was an administrator for the World Health Organization, and spearheaded early AIDS research in the 1980s. Mann joined the Centers for Disease Control in 1975, staying there until 1977 when he became the State Epidemiologist for New Mexico, until 1984..<br>
<br>
He moved to Zaire in March 1984 as a founder of Project SIDA, an effort to study AIDS in Africa, after being recruited by fellow epidemiologist Joseph B. McCormick.[3] In 1986 he founded the WHO's Global Programme for AIDS, resigning this post in 1990 to protest the lack of response from the United Nations with regard to AIDS, and the actions of the then WHO director-general Hiroshi Nakajima..<br>
<br>
In 1990, Mann founded the health and human rights organization HealthRight International (initially known as Doctors of the World-USA), to fill a void he perceived amongst the health and human rights organizations in the United States and to create a unique organization whose mission was to create sustainable programs that promote and protect health and human rights in the United States and abroad.[5]<br>
<br>
Mann directed the launch in 1994 of the journal [1]Health and Human Rights (journal), published by the François Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, which he also helped to establish.[2] Mann was also a professor of epidemiology at Harvard's School of Public Health..<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Mann died in the crash of Swissair Flight 111</span> in 1998 along with his second wife, AIDS researcher Mary Lou Clements-Mann.[4] At the time of his death, Mann was the dean of the Allegheny University School of Public Health (now Drexel University School of Public Health) in Philadelphia.</div></blockquote>

some speculations about Swissair 111 <a href="http://www.cabaltimes.com/2014/12/13/swr111-shearwater/" class="postlink">http://www.cabaltimes.com/2014/12/13/swr111-shearwater/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>New revelations pertaining to the disappearance of MH370 are putting a new perspective on the 1998 alleged “crash” Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Canada, minutes away from a major Canadian Airbase, CFB Shearwater. In the post, we apply everything we learnt from the disappearance of MH370 and subsequent redirection to Diego Garcia to the alleged “crash” of SWR111, and we learn that like MH370, SWR111 may have secretly landed.<br>
<br>
SWR111 was on a routine flight from New York to Geneva on 2nd September 1998 when the pilot reported smoke on board, and diverted the plane towards Halifax International Airport near the Canadian shore.  While Halifax International Airport was not far from the shore, there was another airport right on the shore, and right on the path SWR111 would take if it  intended to land at Halifax. That was the Canadian Airforce Base at Shearwater, with a runway big enough to handle massive military cargo planes. SWR111 allegedly crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, at a visible distance from the Canadian shoreline, five minutes away from CFB Shearwater.<br>
<br>
.. In the case of SWR111, many of the passengers seemed to have been handpicked for that flight because they were targeted individuals, and it was clear to the planners that the plane would officially “crash” right from the beginning. Unlike Malaysia, Switzerland is completely under the control of The Powers That Be and their banking institutions. And they do care a lot about it, even protecting the tiny little nation from two vicious World Wars, even though it was located in the geographic center of them. And therefore there was no point in using a missing plane to make the Swiss government catapult to certain demands. Therefore SWR111 was only about targeting some of the passengers that had boarded the flight and stealing precious cargo that had been put on board, presumably with the foreknowledge that it could never be recovered...<br>
<br>
In the case of SWR111, we see the same treatment of CFB Shearwater. Nobody asks why the plane was not diverted to to CFB Shearwater which was more closer than Halifax airport (because that would draw unwarranted attention towards it). Nobody asks what the radar operators at CFB Shearwater saw on their special military radars, which unlike the radar at Halifax Airport, could still pick up the path of SWR111 even if its transponder was shut off. Strangely enough, we are told that another Canadian Airforce Base on the other side of the Nova Scotian peninsula, CFB Greenwood, monitored SWR111 till its last moments.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This flight was also a codeshare flight with Delta Air Lines...S<span style="color:#FF0040">wissair Flight 111 was known as the "UN shuttle"</span> because of its popularity with United Nations officials traveling between the organization's two biggest centers. The flight also carried business executives, scientists, and researchers</div></blockquote></div>
