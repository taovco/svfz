			<div class="content">This is really quite simple. I've just started to do some much needed work on this post :<span style="color:#00FF40"> Klaus Schwab, British, Israeli &amp; American Intelligence Services and the Occult</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2866&amp;p=10158#p10158" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=2866&amp;p=10158#p10158</a> when once again I came across Hollywood's connections to the Supreme Master Ching Hai.. a secretive cult which is very much behind the Green movement.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Summary of that post: <br>
<br>
Klaus Schwab Swiss connections leads to Urs Schwarzenbach, a good friend of Prince Charles who owns his own polo club.  Schwarzenbach and his lawyer Ulrich Kohli are caught up in a VAT fraud and art trafficking scandal. <br>
<br>
From Kohli's instagram account.. a pic of himself with Michael Jackson and Uri Geller <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BumsYPUHfZm/" class="postlink">https://www.instagram.com/p/BumsYPUHfZm/</a><br>
<br>
Kohli also met 'Barack Obama in New York's Harvard Club. And he had letters of thanks from George W. Bush. As a donor, he was accepted into an «Inner Circle»' according to a Swiss newspaper. <br>
<br>
Schwarzenbach's wife is the godmother of Prince Edward.  Edward has connections to an art gallery that plies its trade on the cruise ships that are connected to Disney and the Epstein islands. One of those cruise ships runs a radio &amp; television station for autistic children and has ties to Mossad.<br>
<br>
Urs Schwarzenbach owns Black Bears polo club and has close connections to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Within that polo playing network is a Hawaiian polo champion Danielle Travis. Her father is Bruce Robert Travis.. who owned the trademark for the  ENLIGHTENED SOCIETY FOR GLOBAL TRANSFORMATION between 2016-2018. That trademark was previously owned by the  Mandalay Resort Group <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/74349850" class="postlink">https://uspto.report/TM/74349850</a> . We made posts about that because of the Route 91 Harvest shooting in las Vegas... which probably was some kind of ritual.<br>
<br>
Mandalay Resort Group (formerly Circus Circus Enterprises) was an American hotel and casino operator based in Paradise, Nevada...Circus Circus was originally owned by Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin..<br>
<br>
<a href="http://digital.library.unlv.edu/jewishheritage/people/stanley-mallin" class="postlink">http://digital.library.unlv.edu/jewishh ... ley-mallin</a><br>
<br>
After the war Mallin and Sarno worked together as tile contractors in Miami, Florida, and house builders in Atlanta, Georgia. However, they did not find success until 1958 when they opened the Atlanta Cabana Hotel with the financial help of investors including Jimmy Hoffa, Allen Dorfman, and <span style="color:#FF0040">Doris Day.</span><br>

</div></blockquote>

Ricky Dearman, the father of the Hampstead kids and the children's mother were members of the Supreme Master Ching Hai. The BBC interviewed him in order to push the narrative that the mother and her boyfriend made the whole thing up.<br>
<br>
Here's a video of the Supreme Master's theatre production <span style="color:#FF0040">Loving the Silent Tears</span> <a href="https://youtu.be/F6VX6G7FLYs" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/F6VX6G7FLYs</a><br>
<br>
It's TERRIBLE.. but everyone's gushing over it.. it's bizarre.<br>
<br>
In the post <span style="color:#00FF40">Heather O’Rourke Case Part 37: Corey’s Demons</span>. viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2738  @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2449" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">darkknight111</a> pointed out the Jamie Dlux video about Heather <a href="https://youtu.be/uOpKsZz-eVA" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/uOpKsZz-eVA</a> In it there is a weird clip of Henry Winkler who says she was probably molested by her father.  He comes off as extremely creepy and insincere.<br>
<br>
Winkler and Spielberg are co-founders of the Children's Action Network <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2787" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2787</a><br>
<br>
Is Spielberg connected to the Supreme Master cult too?  Yup. <a href="http://godsdirectcontact.eu/eng/activities/events/a-events-100stars.htm" class="postlink">http://godsdirectcontact.eu/eng/activit ... 0stars.htm</a> [archived: <a href="https://archive.is/3GLXF" class="postlink">https://archive.is/3GLXF</a>]<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Supreme Master Ching Hai, after having attended the St. Jude Hollywood Gala, and due to the sincerity of Hollywood stars with an inner longing for spiritual satisfaction, made special arrangements to return to Beverly Hills on Oscar Sunday, March 21, 1999, to attend an Oscar party, yet another star-studded event.<br>
<br>
President of 21st Century Entertainment and Vice-President of Glendale Studios Edvard Akopyan attended the "One World... of Peace Through Music" Concert on December 18, 1998 at the Shrine Auditorium. Thoroughly impressed by the beautiful compositions inspired by Supreme Master Ching Hai's poetry and the silent work She has done for humankind throughout the years, Mr. Akopyan took the opportunity to invite Supreme Master Ching Hai as his special guest to the Oscar party held at The Beverly Hills Hotel in the heart of Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard.<br>
<br>
This 8th annual event, "Night of 100 Stars Gala", is held to support Martin Scorsese's Film Preservation Foundation, which is committed to preserving the nation's motion picture history for future generations to enjoy the wonderful entertainment that films provide. The board members presently also include the following well-respected and prestigious directors: <span style="color:#FF0040">Steven Spielberg</span>, Clint Eastwood, Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, <span style="color:#FF0040">Robert Redford</span>, and Sydney Pollack.
</div></blockquote>

Many more names at that link.  <br>
<br>
I think that not only was Heather O'Rourke molested and abused, I think that this was part of a Hollywood blackmailing ring.  That's how they get everyone to keep quiet. Just listen to that story again of how she was made to walk around on stage while production crew and studio heads sat in the audience jacking off.  <br>

Robert C. Wian (June 15, 1914 – March 31, 1992) was the founder of the Big Boy restaurant chain. The restaurant started as a 10-stool hamburger stand in Glendale, California, opening in 1936 with an investment of $300 raised from the sale of his car. Wian sold Bob's Big Boy and rights to the Big Boy chain to the Marriott Corp. in 1967 for $7 million[4] ($54 million in 2019).<br>
<br>
..After selling Big Boy, Wian remained as a Marriott vice-president and president of the "Big Boy Restaurants of America" division for about a year, then sat on the Marriott board for an additional year before retiring.

			<div class="content">Shriners HQ is in Indianapolis <a href="https://www.muratshriners.com/" class="postlink">https://www.muratshriners.com/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 1882, the world was changing. The last bare-knuckled championship fight was held. Jesse James was shot in the back. In Indianapolis John Brush decided on another project that would change the face of Indianapolis forever. Brush, who was raised to the sublime degree in New York, pulled five of his Masonic brothers together and traveled to Cincinnati to visit the sixth temple in Shrinedom, Syrian Temple, established February 6, 1877. They wanted a Shrine temple in Indianapolis. At the time there were 450 symbolic lodges in Indiana.<br>
<br>
Right from the start, the Indianapolis Shrine was special. While we don't know why the name was chosen, our name was the first to not have Arabic origin. The founders chose the name of the son of an innkeeper in France who left theological studies at the outbreak of the French Revolution. His name was Joachim Murat (Mur-ah) and he became a general serving Napoleon in Italy and Egypt. He was so good he was proclaimed the king of Naples in 1808. In the Nubian Desert, there is also an oasis called Bir Murat the general visited often to refresh his soldiers. Actor Rene Auberjonois, most noted for his shape shifter roles in Star Trek, is General Murat's great-great-great grandson. Murat was executed by a firing squad after a failed attempt to regain control of Naples.</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://www.muratshriners.com/murat-history" class="postlink">https://www.muratshriners.com/murat-history</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...During the term of Illustrious Sir Howard Foley in 1968, the growth of Murat, now with more than 20,000 members, forced the nobles to consider more space. The uniform Bodies Club was torn down and the cornerstone laid for the new Shrine Center on May 29, 1968. The Cast conducted the ceremonies.<br>
<br>
It only took a year and Potentate Dick Hunt dedicated the new Shrine Club. There was now enough space for the nobles and their ladies. It was just in time because the very popular J. Worth Baker, "Bake" to the nobles and Potentate in 1957, was about to become the Imperial Sir and Indianapolis hosted the Imperial Session again. Bake was Murat's second Imperial Potentate and the first to be born in Indiana.<br>
<br>
America was full into the space age. Several of the seven Mercury astronauts were Shriners including Gus Grissom who flew the Liberty Bell 7 Mercury capsule and died in a fire on the pad in Apollo 1. The Imperial Session Parade held on July 14, 1970, featured Noble Buzz Aldrin who a year earlier was the second man to walk on the moon. The next day Tony Hulman, one of Murat's Green Fezzes, arranged a demonstration race at his Speedway. The winner was Johnny Rutherford who went on to win the great race three times.<br>
<br>
On July 27, 1974, Potentate Don Edwards invited Potentate Foley's widow to burn the million dollar mortgage for the Shrine Center. The north wall of the club has a desert scene that is not painted. It is made up of 262,000 ceramic tiles. <br>
<br>
By the 1980s, the leadership was aware of a growing problem with the older parts of the mosque, with seriously deteriorating terra cotta trim, copper roofing, marquee, and roofs. The temple embarked on a long campaign to "restore" the old buildings, including selling naming rights to windows, bricks, and so forth. The Elias J. Jacoby Foundation, Inc. was formed as the principal means of raising money on an after-tax basis, one of the first of its kind in the nation. The John Brush Society, Inc. was formed to promote renewed performances in the theatre; and the J. Worth Baker Library Foundation, Inc. was formed to be a repository for the masses of memorabilia that had been accumulated and continued to be produced by Shriners, particularly Murat Shriners..<br>
<br>
..By the mid-1980s, a new group, known as the "Hillbillies," had become active nationally and with the assistance of Glenn Speckman, Potentate in 1990, became very active at Murat Temple. Although never constituted a "Unit" or "Club" of Murat Temple, the Hillbillies met, initiated many members, and continue to meet at the Murat Shrine Club.<br>
<br>
...Shouts of "Hail Caesar" greeted the election of John Cinotto as Potentate in 2001. With his extensive experience as Building and Ground chairman and his years of service as circus director, John brought a wealth of experience to the job of leading our temple.<br>
<br>
The Imperial Session was held at Las Vegas in 2001 and naturally the nobility of Murat stayed at Caesars! John would go on to be elected to the Imperial line and presently serves as Imperial High Priest and Prophet.

Corey and Susie are asking all us meat-lovers to “Give Peas A Chance.” Fat chance of getting me to give up steak-but the ad is still quite charming.<br>

On the evening of February 22, 1994, the Supreme Master Ching Hai, a world spiritual leader from Formosa, received the "World Spiritual Leadership Award" at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chicago. Nearly two thousand attended the spectacular event, which was hosted by the Governors of six Midwestern states and Mr. Hung kwang Chen, Chief Secretary of the World Cultural Communication Association. A joint proclamation was made by the Governors of the six states, and the 22nd of February was designated "The Supreme Master Ching Hai Day"..<br>
<br>
n view of the serious conditions and the inhabitants' great losses from the flood disaster in the Midwest last year, the compassionate Supreme Master Ching Hai launched relief activities by Her disciples. Practitioners from the U.S.A. and Formosa donated US$170,000 for the relief of the flood victims to six states in the Midwest: Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Kansas, Missouri and Minnesota.<br>
<br>
The Supreme Master Ching Hai has always been quietly doing charitable deeds all over the world, helping countless disaster victims and refugees. She also travels around the world to spread the Quan Yin Method, to elevate the spirituality of mankind. She truly deserves to be awarded the "World Spiritual Leadership Award."</div></blockquote>

1996 - Far from Washington, money scandal forces Ching Hai into limelight <a href="https://apnews.com/article/a711ff289618b54f0b595150f4a4aa74" class="postlink">https://apnews.com/article/a711ff289618 ... 50f4a4aa74</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The fund created to pay President Clinton’s legal bills from the Whitewater case and other matters disclosed last week that it had returned $640,000 to donors, many of whom belonged to the sect.<br>
<br>
Nguyen’s personal check for $1,000 has not been returned. He said he made the donation to the fund earlier this year after members learned through electronic mail, TV and newspaper reports, and ``maybe talk between us,″ that they could help defray Clinton’s mounting legal bills.<br>
<br>
``He is a good person, a spiritual person,″ Nguyen said of Clinton.<br>
<br>
Standing on the outskirts of Ching Hai’s compound in the rugged Riverside County hills, Nguyen said the entire affair was ``only a mistake.″<br>
<br>
``This is a spiritual place,″ the Vietnamese native said. ``It doesn’t matter what happened outside. We just enjoy the spiritual life here.″<br>
<br>
But investigators working for the fund reportedly suspected many contributions were bogus because the donors appeared unable to afford $1,000 gifts. Some signatures on the donation checks had identical handwriting, and some of the donations were in sequentially numbered money orders from people in different cities, the fund’s lawyer has said.<br>
<br>
In March, fund-raiser and Clinton friend Charles Yah Lin Trie delivered $460,000 to the Presidential Legal Expense Trust. He later provided more money, but the fund returned all of it _ a total of $640,000.<br>
<br>
Fund administrators feared that Trie was using Ching Hai members as a front to conceal the true source of the donations, or to violate contribution limits set by the fund. But Trie’s link to the group is unclear and no larger scheme has been uncovered.<br>
<br>
On Thursday, the Justice Department issued subpoenas both to the White House counsel’s office and the trust seeking records related to the return of the donations.<br>
<br>
Nguyen, 34, a U.S. citizen who owns a vegetarian food manufacturing firm, said he was not reimbursed by anyone and that no one was pressured to donate. His own wife, a fellow disciple and a Republican, did not contribute.<br>
<br>
And while some sect members borrowed the money from friends, he did not.<br>
<br>
``People, from my point of view, they appreciate the government to give them freedom to come to the U.S.A. and start a new life,″ he said of the many Asian immigrant members.<br>
<br>
``Because we are Americans, we need to fulfill our rights to support a good president,″ he said. ``After four years he did good work. He helped a lot of people in and outside the U.S.A.″<br>
<br>
Asked why he and other members chose to donate to the legal defense fund instead of the Democratic Party or Clinton’s re-election campaign, Nguyen said, ``That I don’t know.″<br>
<br>
He said he had never heard of Trie until the name surfaced in news reports.<br>
<br>
On Friday, volunteers tended the compound’s gardens in preparation for the hundreds of meditators who throng there every weekend. The center also expects a visit this month from Ching Hai, said Nguyen, who unfailingly refers to her as ``master.″</div></blockquote>

All Hail the Supreme Master! (Of Anti-Meat Propaganda) <a href="https://www.consumerfreedom.com/2009/11/4026-all-hail-the-supreme-master-of-anti-meat-propaganda/" class="postlink">https://www.consumerfreedom.com/2009/11 ... ropaganda/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What do you get when you combine two obnoxious animal rights groups (the ridiculously misnamed Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and the phony-baloney Humane Society of the United States) with a self-anointed “Supreme Master” cult leader? This Sunday’s climate change conference in Washington, DC. Speakers include reps from both animal rights groups, and the keynote address will be delivered by the “Supreme Master” Ching Hai. Ching who, you ask? Having attained “full enlightenment” in the Himalayas, she’s a cult leader out to spread a tofu-laden meditation gospel. You can find out all about her at websites called “God’s direct contact” and “God’s immediate contact.”<br>
If her website’s names don’t tell you all you need to know, there’s even a Supreme Master television station that runs 24/7 programming with two-dozen simultaneous sets of subtitles. (For an idea of what’s broadcast, here’s one, shall we say, interesting example.)<br>
So why is a cult leader running a climate change conference? To shill for an anti-meat agenda. Part of Ching Hai’s spiritual teaching is strict vegetarianism, and her website calls on followers to “Be Veg” to save the planet and change their diets to meat-free.<br>
That, of course, is where PCRM and HSUS fit in; they share the Ching Hai cult’s dedication to a vegan future. By tying livestock to climate change, activists hope to marginalize meat consumption and push for burdensome regulations on its production.<br>
But the facts just aren’t on their side (even if they get someone to meditate on it for them). A 2008 report from the Environmental Protection Agency inventoried greenhouse gases and determined that U.S. meat production was responsible for less than 3 percent of emissions.<br>
Might there be another motivation behind meatless propaganda and TV broadcasts? Let’s just point out that Ching Hai owned more than 50 vegetarian restaurants as of the mid 1990s. And the Ching Hai International Association in Los Angeles reported over $100,000 in profit on sales of “religious” books and other items, according to its 2007 tax filings.<br>
Maybe we shouldn’t be too hard on these guys. After all, a judge in the United Kingdom ruled yesterday that climate change beliefs are akin to religion. As for beliefs about animal rights and liberating the chickens, well, the jury is still out. But if HSUS and PCRM want to rest their credibility on an alliance with a mysterious cult leader, who are we to stop them?</div></blockquote></div>

<br>
It’s World Vegan Day, so we find out why these famous faces adopted the plant-based diet..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ariana Grande: The ‘Positions’ singer has reportedly been vegan since 2013..<br>
<br>
Jared Leto: The 48-year-old ‘Joker’ actor is known for looking pretty much the same, no matter what age he is. Asked in 2013 about preserving his appearance, he told ‘GQ’: “It’s probably just down to sleep and diet. If you travel long haul a lot or don’t sleep much, it’s not going to last very long, that’s for sure. I’m pretty healthy so I think that helps a lot. I’ve been that way for a long time – 20 solid years of eating vegetarian/vegan and taking care of myself. That probably helps the preservation process.”<br>
<br>
Natalie Portman: Though the actress paused her diet in 2011 while pregnant, she’s outspoken about her veganism..<br>
<br>
Beyonce: Beyonce went public about her veganism two years ago — but it seems like it’s not a permanent dietary choice for the Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter, but more of a “nutrition challenge” that she and her husband Jay Z often embrace...

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Newly discharged from the Marines after World War II, Scotty Bowers arrived in Hollywood in 1946. Young, charismatic, and strikingly handsome, he quickly caught the eye of many of the towns stars and starlets.

His own lovers included Edith Piaf, Spencer Tracy, Vivien Leigh, Cary Grant, and the abdicated King of England Edward VIII, and he arranged tricks or otherwise crossed paths with Tennessee Williams, Charles Laughton, Vincent Price, Katharine Hepburn, Rita Hayworth, Errol Flynn, Gloria Swanson, Noø«l Coward, Mae West, James Dean, Rock Hudson and J.

Lots of interesting reviews like:<br>
<br>
“Controversial . . . vivid . . . As well as a titillating catalogue of sexual intrigue, the book is designed to expose of the hypocrisy and fear that swirled beneath the industry's on-screen glamour and crafted wholesomeness. . . . [Bowers] dramatically describes the climate of fear in an era when he worked as a bartender at Hollywood parties while the LAPD vice squad were prowling the hills in their patrol cars looking for parties and opportunities to arrest the participants.”—The Guardian (UK)<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>So did Dr. Gabriel Cousens, Director, Tree of Life Foundation, Arizona <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Cousens" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Cousens</a><br>
<br>
Gabriel (born May 14, 1943) is an American, homeopath, and spiritual practicer holistic medicine. In 1976 Cousens legally changed his name from Kenneth Gabriel Cousens to Gabriel. Cousens advocates live foods therapy, a nutritional regimen which he says can cure diabetes,[1] depression[2][3] and other chronic degenerative diseases. He is the founder of the "Essene Order of Light", a spiritual organization based upon teachings from the Jewish Kabbalah, the Torah, and modern interpretations of the Essenes. The Essenes are a mystical group from the second century B.C.E. who lived in community, eschewed materialism and grew their own food. The modern Essene movement was founded by Edmond Bordeaux Szekely, a religious scholar who promoted a simple holistic lifestyle of meditation and raw vegan eating and published several books on the Essenes in the early 20th century.[4] Essene Order of Light is taught by Cousens at "Tree of Life Foundation", an organization directed by Cousens and headquartered at its "Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center" in Patagonia, Arizona...<br>
<br>
He earned his medical degree from Columbia Medical School in 1969, and he completed his residency in psychiatry in 1973..<br>
<br>
Cousens says he switched to a vegetarian diet around age 30,[8] after which he began teaching meditation. In 1974 he went to India to study with the swami Muktananda (1908-1982), staying for seven years.[12] He returned to the United States in 1981 and studied Kabbalah and the Essenes, becoming ordained in 1988...<br>
<br>
...In 1998, 57-year-old Charles Levy of New Jersey died after being treated at the center over a five-day period. The cause of death was determined by the Santa Cruz County Medical Examiner, who along with the Arizona Medical Board attributed the death to a gas gangrene infection caused by <span style="color:#FF0040">"bovine adrenal fluid" injections</span> given by Cousens as part of a treatment for fatigue.[26][27][28] The autopsy also found that Levy had hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, and coronary atherosclerosis.[27] Levy's son said that his father was healthy, able to run three miles, not overweight, and had no high blood pressure at the time of his visit to the spa, and the family sued for malpractice.[26] Cousens settled the suit for an undisclosed amount paid to the family.[26] The case came up before the Arizona Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners in 2001. Despite the medical examiner's report and testimony, then Board Chairman Bruce Shelton said he "found no medical fault with Dr. Cousens' care of" Levy and the board found "no violation of homeopathic law" in Cousens' treatment.[26][28] Cousens argued that the medical examiner had misdiagnosed the cause of death, which he said was toxic shock unrelated to the injections, a claim that the Levy family attorney called "outrageous"</div></blockquote>

"bovine adrenal fluid" injections ??? Real homeopaths don't do that kind of shit...<br>
<br>
Arizona's homeopathic board is the second chance for doctors who may not deserve one <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizonas-homeopathic-board-is-the-second-chance-for-doctors-who-may-not-deserve-one-6431898" class="postlink">https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/ar ... ne-6431898</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>..In the world of medicine, there are no second chances. A doctor makes a misstep, and a patient can die. That's why the boards that license allopathic and osteopathic doctors — M.D.s and D.O.s, respectively — are so tough, and often criticized for not being tough enough. .. Lose your M.D. license in one state in the U.S., and you may never practice medicine again. Certainly not in this state.<br>
<br>
Unless you know about Arizona's Homeopathic Board of Medical Examiners. For a few hundred dollars, some extra training (sometimes provided by the board's president himself, for a fee) and a test on the principles of homeopathy, an M.D. or D.O. who likely can't secure another medical license can get a license to practice homeopathic medicine in the state of Arizona. You'll be banned from some procedures, but for the most part, you can go back to practicing medicine — diagnosing patients, prescribing drugs, even performing minor surgeries.<br>
<br>
ll the doctors listed above — and more — are now homeopathic physicians, licensed to practice by the state of Arizona. (Except for that Utah doctor. He lost his homeopath's license last month after a patient died during a procedure he was not authorized to perform.)<br>
<br>
And it's all perfectly legal under Arizona law... Arizona's license is a unique opportunity. In effect, the law amounts to a loophole for doctors who've gotten in trouble, or know they'll soon get in trouble, to practice medicine with the initials M.D.h., as homeopathic physicians — even if they don't practice homeopathy.</div></blockquote>

Operatives like Cousens are also useful for the medical establishment to bash alternative medicine practioners.. as this article on the coronavirus does... <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-pseudoscience/nonsense-about-coronavirus-goes-viral" class="postlink">https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/healt ... goes-viral</a><br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gafni" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gafni</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Marc Gafni (born Marc Winiarz; 1960) is an American author and former rabbi who became a New Age spiritual teacher.[1][2] His former Orthodox teacher, Efrat Chief Rabbi Shlomo Riskin repudiated him and revoked Gafni's ordination in 1994, the only ordination Rabbi Shlomo has ever revoked.[3][4][5] The Alliance for Jewish Renewal banned Gafni from teaching in Jewish Renewal contexts.[6][7] Reb Zalman Schachter-Shalomi revoked his rabbinical ordination of Gafni in 2006.[8] The ordination page of Gafni's own website is blank.[9]<br>
<br>
Multiple women have accused Gafni of sexual assault.[10][11][12] Gafni acknowledged a nine-month "relationship" with a 14-year-old girl when he was 19;[1][13][14] he denies the "relationship" was abusive, describing it as consensual.[15][16][17] The alleged victim states that she was 13 and that it was assault. In 2019, Gafni was named in a sexual abuse lawsuit against Yeshiva University.<br>
<br>
Gafni worked with Jewish Public School Youth (JPSY), an organization providing Jewish social clubs in public schools.[20] In 1988, <span style="color:#FF0040">Gafni also worked as a rabbi in Boca Raton, Florida</span>..<br>
<br>
Gafni majored in philosophy as an undergraduate at Queens College, and earned his doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University..<br>
<br>
..He advocates a new set of teachings around eros, sexuality and relationships in his book Mystery of Love and CD set Erotic and the Holy.[29][30] At the core of his message is what Gafni refers to as the unique self.[31] Gafni believes that "the sexual is the ultimate Spiritual Master" and has written "I was convinced from an early age that religion had lost what I believed must have been its original erotic vitality... I knew that the sexual, if liberated and ethically expressed, must somehow hold the mystery of return to the much larger-than-sexual Eros."..<br>
<br>
In 2010, Gafni, Mariana Caplan,[22] Sally Kempton, and Lori Galperin founded the Center for World Spirituality.[32] At the Center, Gafni and Ken Wilber founded a Wisdom Council to envision a spirituality based on Integral Principles.[33] The Wisdom Council includes members such as <span style="color:#FF0040"> Gafni, Wilber, Tony Robbins, Warren Farrell, Lori Galperin, Sally Kempton.[34] The co-chair of Center for World Spirituality was Whole Foods CEO John Mackey</span>..<br>
<br>
Gafni is the author of eight books on spirituality and religion, including the 2001 Soul Prints.[37] Marc Gafni's second English-language book, The Mystery of Love, was later converted to an audio lecture series called The Erotic and the Holy, published by Sounds True. He also co-authored <em class="text-italics">Who is Afraid of Lilith? Rereading the Kabbalah of the Feminine Shadow with Ohad Ezrachi</em>..<br>
<br>
...As a result of these allegations, a number of new-age spiritual leaders, who had previously worked with and endorsed Gafni, have publicly withdrawn their support and written a public statement disavowing themselves from him, including Deepak Chopra, Joan Borysenko, Andrew Harvey, author Jean Houston, and Stephen Dinan.[64] Additionally, Reb Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, revoked his rabbinical ordination of Gafni</div></blockquote>

Yeah, it's a deep rabbithole.  Check out the Supreme Master's Loving Huts logo.. it's got three sixes in it.</div>

Patch Adams <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Adams" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Adams</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The 1998 film Patch Adams was based on Adams' life and his views on medicine. Adams has heavily criticized the film, saying it eschewed an accurate representation of his beliefs in favor of commercial viability. He said that out of all aspects of his life and activism, the film portrayed him merely as a funny doctor.[11] Patch Adams also said of Robin Williams in an interview, "He made $21 million for four months of pretending to be me, in a very simplistic version, and did not give $10 to my free hospital. Patch Adams, the person, would have, if I had Robin's money, given all $21 million to a free hospital in a country where 80 million cannot get care."..<br>
<br>
However, in another interview, Adams did clarify that he did not dislike Williams saying, "I think Robin himself is compassionate, generous and funny. I like to think that that's who I am, and so I think he was the only actor I wanted to play me, and I think he did a fabulous job."[11] Williams also had actively supported <span style="color:#BF0040">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</span> [a Shriner hospital] for several years.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Nechama Rivlin (Hebrew: נֶחָמָה רִיבְלִין‎; 5 June 1945 – 4 June 2019) was an Israeli researcher, science secretary, and First Lady of Israel from 2014 to 2019.[1][2] She worked at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1967 to 2007...<br>
<br>
Rivlin became a researcher at Hebrew University in 1967. Her initial role was in the Department of Zoology and she later worked in the genetics division in the Department of Ecology.[6] She later worked as a scientific secretary at the university's Institute of Life Sciences.[7] Rivlin retired in 2007..<br>
<br>
In her position as the wife of the Israeli President, she concentrated on areas she was most familiar with through her academic work and family. One area of focus was nature and the environment.[8][9]<br>
<br>
She was also a vocal supporter of women and children.[10] Inaugurating her first major initiative as First Lady, she welcomed 200 Akim activists to the President's residence to draw attention to the needs of intellectually challenged children and to advocate for supporting them.[11] Sharing a message of peace and tolerance, she hosted students and teachers from the <em class="text-italics">Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish-Arab Education in Israel</em> at the President's Residence following an arson attack at their school.[12] Rivlin said violence against children was a great problem throughout society, and that Israel should work to investigate and address <span style="color:#FF0040">child abuse</span>. "We must break this conspiracy of silence once and for all", she said.[13] In March 2016, she hosted a group of women who had publicly shared their experiences with sexual assault and domestic abuse.[14] Rivlin told them that by telling their stories, they would help others who face difficult issues.<br>
<br>
Rivlin joined her husband on international trips. Together, they visited U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House for the December 2015 Hanukkah celebration.[16][17] Nechama and Reuven lit a menorah made in Israel by designer Ze'ev Raban.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This guy that I talked about. The first day we met he told me that he had studied in the USA. Cybernetics &amp; Systems Theory...I didn’t know Patch Adams. Only from what my Ex had told me. That he studied at his school for designing society, that he had met him at some kind of camp, back then when he was a child. And that everything that he was proud of today was something that he had learned from this guy: Patch Adams. To me this name meant nothing...<br>
<br>
Five days ago, I googled exactly what had rushed through my mind:<br>
<br>
“Patch Adams pedophile”<br>
<br>
He's a close friend of Marion Pettie, main figure in the Finder's Cult. That’s the first thing that came up in my search. And this is where it gets so complicated …<br>
<br>
The Satanic Panic<br>
<br>
First of all, for chronological classification reasons: Yes, it was the time of what people called the satanic panic, BUT the satanic panic itself was a division tool formed by secret services. Key figures in this narrative, causing a lot of it were Michael Aquino (CIA), who has been a guest to the Wewelsburg as well, btw. and Ted Gunderson (FBI).. Furthermore it was the time of the Franklin cover up. Again, a complete story on its own. AND: While narratives like the satanic panic back then or #pizzagate are nothing else but tools of division..<br>
<br>
THE FACTS BEHIND IT ARE TRUE<br>
And when it comes to the Finders: In 1956 Marion Pettie received Intelligence training at Georgetown University and in Frankfurt, Germany. In an interview he brags about how he got his wife a job at the CIA.<br>
<br>
Patch Adams, the guy who taught my Ex everything. says, nothing ever happened here.<br>
Furthermore, there are allegations that Robin Williams was blackmailed into playing Patch Adams in a movie. A movie? THE movie...<br>
<br>
t’s about Patch Adams.<br>
It’s called Patch Adams.<br>
<br>
Jon Robberson who worked for Pedowood is the only source for that claim. Before he decided to put on the armor of god and not follow the news cycle any further (my personal opinion: the best that all of us can do). So, that’s just what one person says. However, even if the blackmailing assumptions wouldn’t be part of the smell, what does somebody has to do to convince Pedowood to produce a movie about your life..<br>
<br>
One day my Ex showed me a video of what he did with Patch Adams in Guatemala. It was a video showing some clowns, running around a slum like scary weirdos, holding a giant penis. He said it would be sexual education.<br>
<br>
Where are the parents?<br>
<br>
I asked.<br>
<br>
It’s a slum.</div></blockquote></div>

One of the attendees: <em class="text-italics">a personal address to the conference by the President of the Club of Rome, Dr. Ashok Khosla, out of Delhi, India. He is the former Director of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and also known to be the personal mentor of Al Gore.</em><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ashok Khosla is an Indian environmentalist currently based in Delhi. He received his PhD in experimental physics from Harvard University with a doctoral dissertation in the hyperfine structure of hydrogen halide isotopes. He is the co-chair of United Nations Environment Programme’s International Resource Panel (UNEP-IRP) and is internationally known for pioneering and contributing to sustainable development. <span style="color:#FF0040">He is recognized for popularizing the word and concept of "sustainability" in international forums</span>. He was actively involved in various projects that defined the environmental views and activities of institutions such as UNEP, UNESCO, UNU, the U.S. Academy of Sciences, IUCN, and the ICSU/SCOPE.[1] He was also the President of IUCN (2008 to 2012) and Club of Rome (2005 to 2012).[2] Ashok Khosla is member of the World Future Council.<br>
<br>
..Khosla was exposed to the issues of sustainable development during his time as a graduate student at Harvard University, while studying experimental physics. In 1964, Khosla met Professor Roger Revelle at the Population Center at Harvard. Revelle, who had been the head of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and science advisor to President John F. Kennedy, was a pioneer in applying science to issues of social relevance. ..<br>
<br>
Upon completion of his PhD in experimental physics, Ashok was asked by the Government of India to establish the Office of Environmental Planning and Coordination (OEPC), the first national environmental agency in the Third World. As director of the OEPC, he worked closely with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, to introduce a broad range of methodological and institutional innovations necessary for managing environmental resources in a developing country such as India. ..</div></blockquote>

<br>
The most influential group that spurred the creation of Klaus Schwab’s symposium was the Club of Rome, an influential think tank of the scientific and monied elite that mirrors the World Economic Forum in many ways, including in its promotion of a global governance model led by a technocratic elite. The Club had been founded in 1968 by Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei and Scottish chemist Alexander King during a private meeting at a residence owned by the Rockefeller family in Bellagio, Italy.</div></blockquote>

Club of Budapest<br>
In 1993, in response to his experience with the Club of Rome, he founded the Club of Budapest to, in his words, "centre attention on the evolution of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors in changing course — from a race towards degradation, polarization and disaster to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics and global sustainability"</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>On Sunday, March 26, Hollywood's most celebrated annual event, the Academy Awards, returned to the same grand venue as the 1998 One World concert, the Shrine Auditorium, to award Oscars to the best in the film industry. During the Oscar presentations, the "Night of 100 Stars" Oscar gala was also being held at the exclusive Beverly Hills Hotel. <br>
<br>
This gala honors past and present Oscar winners and supports The Film Foundation, whose goal is to help preserve precious classic movies. Last year Supreme Master Ching Hai was invited to attend the gala by the President of 21st Century Entertainment and Vice-President of Glendale Studios Edvard Akopyan, who attended "One World... of peace through music" and was impressed by the beautiful compositions inspired by Master Ching Hai's poetry, and the silent work She has done for humankind throughout the years.<br>
<br>
This year, <span style="color:#FF0040">Peter Nygard, internationally renowned fashion designer, president of Nygard International and a sponsor of the Night of 100 Stars, along with Hollywood film producer Norby Walters, extended a special invitation to Supreme Master Ching Hai</span> to attend this grand event, where the many stars whose hearts She had touched last year hoped to see Her again. Although Supreme Master Ching Hai was unable to attend due to a busy lecture tour schedule, Her care was conveyed through several representatives at the event.<br>
<br>
...Many others expressed how they missed Master Ching Hai's elegant demeanor and compassionate heart and also extended their best wishes to Her, including Peter Nygard, model and actress Anna Nicole Smith, and actors David Carradine, Kevin McCarthy, Henry Silva and Vincent Schiavelli. Other well-wishers included Buzz Aldrin, first astronaut on the moon, and his wife Lois, and Ken Huthmaker of Entertainment Sports Today. Many of these superstars admire and hope to once again meet with Supreme Master Ching Hai.<br>

The Oscar Party No One Knows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302170105/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/fashion/night-of-100-stars-norby-walters.html" class="postlink">https://web.archive.org/web/20160302170 ... lters.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>On Sunday, Mr. Walters will host another gathering: an annual Oscar viewing party that he calls Night of 100 Stars.<br>
<br>
Let us get this out of the way: Night of 100 Stars (estimates vary) is not as hot a ticket as Graydon Carter’s party for Vanity Fair (outside the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills) or Elton John’s with InStyle at the Pacific Design Center.<br>
<br>
Mr. Walters’s event occupies the grand International Ballroom at the Beverly Hilton (after years at the Crystal Ballroom at the Beverly Hills Hotel), and the party’s publicist, Edward Lozzi, is this year confirming Vince Vaughn, Rumer Willis and Cloris Leachman.<br>
<br>
True, Night of 100 Stars lacks the product-promotional opportunities that have become Oscar night’s overarching purpose. The event’s chief underwriter and title sponsor is not a Hollywood power broker but Peter Nygard, a Finnish-born Canadian retail tycoon and aging playboy who has lately been at war with a hedge-fund billionaire over their neighboring manses in the Bahamas.<br>
<br>
...Mr. Walters not only advertises his Oscar party, now in its 26th year, as the longest-running one in town, but also the most accessible: to civilian interlopers willing to spend $1,000 for a seat at the table and as much as $25,000 for a V.I.P. table package. “You can’t get into the Vanity Fair party unless you’re Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks or Tom Mix,” he pointed out pragmatically.<br>
<br>
...Mr. Walters’s son, Gary Michael Walters, chief executive of Bold Films, which had “Whiplash” in Oscar contention last year, called his father a cult figure in Hollywood. “You’re in a town of strivers who are looking for the next job,” the younger Mr. Walters said. “Norby is never going to give you a job. He’s going to give you a cookie.”<br>
<br>
....According to Mr. Ade, General Talent represented 80 percent of the R&amp;B; and funk charts. “If they wanted to make it big and get on the right tours and grow their business,” he said of the performers, “they had to be with us.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Ade said he wanted to expand the business into the white mainstream charts, while Mr. Walters had his sights set on a different kind of black entertainers: athletes. With trademark flamboyance, Mr. Walters and a young partner named Lloyd Bloom barnstormed the world of big-time college sports, flashing cash at dozens of star football players under their World Sports &amp; Entertainment banner.<br>
<br>
Signed to postdated contracts to circumvent National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations, many of the players abandoned Mr. Walters and Mr. Bloom for more established agents when it came time to go professional. Mr. Walters, not to be outdone, sued six of the players for breach of contract.<br>
<br>
When players reported being threatened over their betrayals and an associate of a rival agent was found beaten in her Chicago office, the F.B.I. initiated a criminal investigation that came to paint Mr. Walters and Mr. Bloom as mob-connected arrivistes despoiling the college game.<br>
<br>
In 1988, both were charged with racketeering and fraud (unrelated to the beating of the agent). Mr. Walters denied being in business with mafia figures; if anything, he saw himself as the victim of his own success.<br>
<br>
..While the convictions were later overturned on appeal — cleared of racketeering, Mr. Walters and Mr. Bloom entered conditional guilty pleas to mail fraud, also later overturned — Mr. Walters sold his share of the booking agency to Mr. Ade and came to Los Angeles for early retirement.<br>
<br>
As it happened, Mr. Bloom was already in Los Angeles, trying his hand at movie industry dealmaking. In the summer of 1993, he was shot to death in his rented Malibu home.<br>
<br>
But with apologies to his onetime client, Ms. Gaynor, Mr. Walters has survived. In transforming what used to be Mr. Bass’s party into Night of 100 Stars, he adroitly borrowed the name and charitable concept of a trio of network TV variety specials put on by the theatrical impresario Alexander H. Cohen at Radio City Music Hall.<br>
<br>
The first “Night of 100 Stars” aired on ABC in 1982, to celebrate the centennial of the Actors Fund. That night, Liza Minnelli performed “New York, New York” with Yankees holding bats, Princess Grace of Monaco gave a speech, a young David Letterman did stand-up and the child star Melissa Gilbert modeled Perry Ellis during a celebrity fashion show.<br>
<br>
The contemporary Night of 100 Stars cannot claim such luster. In 2004, around the time the fund-raiser was being looked at by a state attorney general’s office that was toughening disclosure rules for charitable organizations, Martin Scorsese’s Film Foundation cut ties with Night of 100 Stars. Mr. Walters subsequently settled a lawsuit for failing to register as a commercial fund-raiser and file financial reports with the state.<br>
<br>
This matters not a whit to those who find in it a blessed refuge from Instagramming and mani-camming, or just Somewhere to Be on a night as fraught for Hollywood as New Year’s Eve.<br>
<br>
“It’s a party that’s being thrown by Norby for his own reasons,” Mr. Hamlin said. “I’ve never even gotten into trying to figure out what they are. But I can go to that party and I can look at a table next to me and I’ll see somebody that I worked with 25 years ago. Or I’ll see somebody I worked with a year ago.”</div></blockquote>

Not one mention of Ching Hai in that article.  Bizarre.</div>

The Festival de Belen is a humanitarian clowning project of Patch Adams' Gesundheit! Institute in cooperation with Doctores Bola Roja de Peru that brings up to 150 humanitarian Clowns from all over the world to Iquitos each year in August since 2005..</em>.&gt;<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Washington, D.C., 4 August 2010 (PAHO) — For the fifth consecutive year, art is being used as a bridge to promote health during the Belén Festival held from 4 to 14 August in Belén, Iquitos, Peru in conjunction with the Gesundheit! Institute and Bolaroja, headed respectively by Dr. Patch Adams and Wendy Ramos...<br>
<br>
The Belén Festival is being held nearly a year after the Pan American Health Organization/ World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and the Red Latinoamericana de Arte para la Transformación Social (RLATS), or Latin American Network of Art for Social Transformation, signed a framework agreement on promoting art as a bridge between health and development. Festival activities are being organized by the Belén Network, comprised of the Gesundheit! Institute; Bolaroja; nongovernmental organizations, such as La Restinga and Selva Amazónica; local and regional governments; PAHO; and others. Support is also being provided by the <span style="color:#FF0040">Peruvian Navy </span>and Air Force and the Stella Maris Association...<br>
<br>
As in past years, many of the 15,000 residents of the Pueblo Libre community in Belén are awaiting the arrival of dozens of humanitarian clowns from all over the world. In addition to bringing love and happiness and holding workshops, they will work with homeowners to paint their houses, thanks to the support and donation of more than 300 gallons of paint from the CPP (Peruvian Paint Company) and the Chems company.</div></blockquote>
