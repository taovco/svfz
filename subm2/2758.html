It is often repeated that children absorb languages best when they are very young. Research shows that the ability to absorb new languages decreases after the age of three. That’s something Kim Constable wants to capitalise on so she has set up a business which offers language classes to young children in the form of play...

Chorus Intelligence, now established in North America and one of the United Kingdom’s leading public safety digital investigation and intelligence software providers, announced today that Frank Rodgers and Edmund Hartnett have joined Chorus Intelligence’s board of advisors to provide strategic direction in their ambitious growth plans for wider expansion into the United States market. ...Frank Rodgers, an FBI National Academy graduate, is a former Lt.

..There are many things we still don't know about Derwick Associates, but there's one we do know: <span style="color:#FFFF40">Alejandro Betancourt</span> (left), Pedro Trebbau and Jeff Canon (right) swindled -at the very least- $70 million USD from the Venezuelan State...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Do readers remember Adam Kaufmann? Former New York's District Attorney's Office über prosecutor cum Derwick Associates lawyer, who went on the record, on the Wall Street Journal no less, saying "We are a transparent company and have nothing to hide"? Well, vindication's a bitch, isn't Adam? As it turns, someone has leaked documents straight from within Derwick Associates' office in Caracas, and what do we find about this "transparent company"? We find a $277 million purchase order from BARIVEN (a PDVSA subsidiary), addressed to Pedro Trebbau (one of Derwick Associates main execs) for a bunch of turbines. We also find a $207 million "Equipment Purchase Agreement" between <span style="color:#FFFF40">Alejandro Betancourt </span>(another of Derwick Associates execs) and Jeff Canon from Energy Parts Solution (a division of ProEnergy Services). What else do we find? We find that both documents refer to the same equipment and have the same date: December 30, 2009.<br>
<br>
Which means, in Kaufmann's own words, it is "transparent" that in concurrent transactions that took place the same day Derwick Associates stole $70 million from BARIVEN. </div></blockquote></div>

The major players behind Peter Kenyon's bid to buy Newcastle <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/who-rockefeller-capital-management-major-15544278" class="postlink">https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/f ... r-15544278</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For a start, RCM isn’t just borrowing the name of John D Rockefeller – the US’ first billionaire, who made his fortune in the oil industry. Instead has direct links to the family with David Rockefeller Jr also serving on the board. And a hedge fund – Viking Global Investors – has invested serious money in the group and hold a majority stake.<br>
<br>
And if you look hard enough there are links to both sports teams and the UK among the people who work for the group.<br>
<br>
Back in November 2017 RCM appointed Greg Fleming – a 55-year-old Wall Street veteran – as Chief Executive Officer a year ago as part of an ambitious five-year plans to grow their assets to $100billion. And Fleming, who has been namechecked in well-sourced reports about Kenyon’s plans for Newcastle, is an intriguing character with a long history on Wall Street. He has recent history of buying sports teams too: he was an advisor for baseball star Derek Jeter in his successful bid to buy MLB side the Miami Marlins.<br>
<br>
According to a report in The Street, he is widely known as “Derek Jeter’s Banker” for his work on the purchase – and he holds a small stake in the team as part of the deal.<br>
<br>
Another name linked to the group with UK ties is Lord Paul Myners – a former Treasury Minister in the Gordon Brown government.<br>
<br>
He joined as a director in March 2018 and is understood to have played a part in RCM’s dealings with United – which are now shrouded in secrecy, partly because of the Non Disclosure Agreement signed by all interested parties.</div></blockquote></div>

The bank and it’s officials/lawyers deliberately withheld crucial documents requested under a High Court order. The bank and it’s officials/lawyers deliberately withheld evidence from the Police, and one of it’s account managers Susan Broadhead gave a false witness statement .<br>
Another one of it’s managers Nicholas Campiche ( Now Head of Pictet – Alternative Investments.) concocted a letter pretending to be a client and closed his account. The senior partner (Ivan Pictet.) sought to have numerous documents destroyed,along with those copies held in their London office’s of Pictet Asset Management. Initially stating that they were forgeries then their lawyers Peters &amp; Peters – Monty Raphael .Q.C.–and the barrister Charles Flint.Q.C. later had to admit in Court that the documents were genuine.<br>

•Monty Raphael. Steps down as head .( Peters and Peters ) May. 2009.<br>
<br>
*** We note that there has been a sharp increase in Peters &amp; Peters partners leaving to go to other practices. Moving does not alleviate them of any responsibility from any illegalities that may have occurred at Peters &amp; Peters during their partnership tenure. From 1999 onwards.<br>

(1)Chief Constable ---- Sir Norman Bettison.<br>
(2)Forces Solicitor ---- Mike Percival.<br>
(3)Head of Economic Crimes Unit.--- Det. Chief Inspector Steven Taylor.<br>
<br>
-- continue to attempt to cover this case up like their F.S.A. Counterparts.<br>
If they do “ watch this space”)<br>
<br>
We have recently been informed that due to pressure from our M.P. that the Ministry of Justice had asked <span style="color:#FF0040">Lord Myners</span> to investigate our claims that the F.S.A. covered up the illegal activities of Pictet Asset Management. London. They might as well have asked Ivan Pictet to investigate .or Friends Reunited.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Lady Myners on Prix Pictet board.</span><br>
<br>
The consensus of opinion is the Pictet &amp; Cie should be prosecuted , and that their banking licence’s should be taken away in the U.K. ( and fined.)<br>
Their solicitors at Peters &amp; Peters --- struck off and prosecuted..<br>
In America they would have all been in prison for the last seven years.<br>
<br>
WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE.<br>
<br>
We note that Det. Chief Inspector Steven Taylor has been removed as the Head of Economic Crime Unit and demoted to Det. Inspector. ( One down two to go).<br>
Both DCI Taylor and the Forces Solicitor Mike Percival continue to blatantly lie to investigating Solicitors and M.P.’s.</div>

<br>
The ninth theme is Fire ..Prix Pictet announces ‘Fire’ as the theme for the ninth cycle of the award. As Chair Stephen Barber explains, the choice of theme is timely.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"Fire has hardly been out of the news since the inferno that consumed <span style="color:#FF0040">Notre Dame</span> in Paris in early 2019. We have seen record rainforest blazes in the <span style="color:#FF0040">Amazon</span>, forest and bush fires in <span style="color:#FF0040">Australia</span> and conflagrations in <span style="color:#FF0040">California</span>. It is the fourth element. Fire destroys and it renews. Fire means survival, renewal, and economic prosperity. Yet our abuse of this most capricious of elements is the source of most of our environmental woes.”<br>
</em><br>
Over the coming months the Prix Pictet’s global network of over 300 nominators will identify portfolios of work that align with the ninth theme. <span style="text-decoration:underline">These portfolios will be reviewed by the independent Jury chaired by Sir David King</span>. The Fire shortlist will be presented at the Rencontres d’Arles in July 2021. ..<br>
......<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The Hope exhibition</span> featuring the work of 12 artists shortlisted for the eighth cycle, Hope, was shown at EPFL ArtLab in Lausanne, Switzerland in September. The exhibition will travel to Palazzo della Gran Guardia in Verona, International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York, Galleria Carla Sozzani in Milan, the Eretz Israel Museum in Tel Aviv and a major museum in Shanghai over the next 12 months.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...On October 28, 1999, the 15th anniversary gala, "The Magic of Starlight," was held at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, USA. Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger (L. A. Confidential, The Natural, Batman) and President of CBS Television, Les Moonves, co-chaired the event...<br>
<br>
Mr. Marc Cohen led Supreme Master Ching Hai upstairs to enjoy the top tier Rose reception party in Le Trianon at the Regent before being seated at the Head Table with his wife, Starlight Board member Kathryn Cohen and himself, popular Hollywood actor Martin Sheen and his wife Janet Sheen, President of CBS Television, Mr. Les Moonves and award-winning actress Swoozie Kurtz. Mistress of Ceremonies for the evening, Swoozie Kurtz (Citizen Ruth, Liar, Liar, Dangerous Liaisons, Bright Lights, Big City), began the program by welcoming all the guests who had come to support the noble work of serving the needs of children. She then introduced award-winning singer and actor, Davis Gaines, who performed a beautiful vocal in his strong, operatic voice. Gaines has performed the title role in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera" more than 2,000 times...<br>
<br>
Starlight President Marc Cohen then came to the stage to thank all of the guests and new friends of the Starlight Foundation. He had also written an introduction for the program booklet, in which he especially thanked Supreme Master Ching Hai and reserved a whole dedication page that included a picture of Master presenting Her contribution to the Starlight Foundation at the benefit concert, "One World... of Peace Through Music."<br>
<br>
The evening's entertainment proceeded with a splendid musical performance by multi-Grammy winner Sheryl Crow..The two designers, Pericles Rellas and Mitchell Edwards, of the new star pin for the Starlight Foundation were so fascinated by Supreme Master Ching Hai's "Ancient Beauty" jewelry collection that they came over to Her table to have a closer look...<br>
<br>
Among the other guests who had the good fortune to meet Supreme Master Ching Hai were Julie Warner, star of CBS' "Family Law," Starlight Board member Bernie Sharf, Starlight Board member Kathryn Cohen, Dee Slattery of Nautica International, Inc., and Steve Webster, Director of Public Relations for Fox Sports Network.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Rockefeller Center’s famed Rainbow Room opened its doors in October of 1934, a fine dining restaurant perched a towering 65 stories above Manhattan’s rapidly developing cityscape...The Rainbow Room maintained its stellar reputation until the early 1980s, when stiff competition from trendy downtown clubs led the management to embark on a two year, $25 million renovation in 1985. While the novelty of the facelift helped keep the Rainbow Room afloat, it failed to fully regain its mid-century appeal, and the Rockefeller family ultimately sold its operational interests to <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cipriani S.A.</span>, a group of successful Italian restaurateurs.... The Rainbow Room closed its hallowed doors on June 5th, 2009.<br>
<br>
Of course, the story didn’t end there. In 2012, the Rainbow Room was granted landmark status from the New York Landmarks Commission, an achievement that solidified the former hot spot’s permanent role in New York City’s cultural history and, in turn, secured its future. After five years of dormancy and yet another round of remodeling, the Rainbow Room reopened for business in October of 2014. While the new guard envisioned a Rainbow Room stocked with high-tech 21st Century touches — “I want this to be today’s extravagant social networking space,” architect Michael Gabellini told Bloomberg in September, 2014 — the Landmark Commission’s strict guidelines ensured that the restaurant’s storied past remain an integral part of its new look. As they say, the band plays on.</div></blockquote>

<br>
"Giuseppe Cipriani’s hotels/bars/restaurants are synonymous with celebrity, and women say they are also where the movie mogul<br>
<br>
attacked them." Movie producer Harvey Weinstein and restaurant magnate Giuseppe Cipriani have been the closest of friends, dining together every Wednesday night at the Sherry-Netherland hotel near Central Park. They invested in each others’ businesses—Cipriani provided money that helped start the fashion label of Weinstein’s wife; Weinstein invested in Cipriani London, and his company rented out an apartment at Cipriani Wall Street, the venue for the star-studded annual AMFAR gala at which Weinstein was a huge fundraiser.<br>
<br>
 Cipriani’s friend was Paolo Zampolli.<br>
<br>
Giuseppe Cipriani and his properties are synonymous with celebrities. Wherever his hotels and restaurants can be found, so are A-listers like Leonardo DiCaprio and Anna Wintour. G Clooney held his bachelor party at Cipriani’s in Venice. Cipriani, is heir to a multibillion-dollar worldwide enterprise that started in Venice in 1931 when his Italian grandfather, Giuseppe, opened Harry’s Bar (with a wealthy Bostonian)...<br>
<br>
In 1985, they opened a Harry’s Bar in New York,they hired the best chefs. The elder Giuseppe wrote cookbooks, He opened Cipriani 42nd Street, Cipriani Dolci in Grand Central Terminal, Cipriani Downtown in SoHo, Cipriani Wall Street and took over operations of the Rainbow Room in 30 Rock.

Only this past week I was bumping into Derek Walcott, the famous West Indian poet.. because of another poet who I thought could very well be a satanist.. he has the smell of one.. Let's see if I can remember how I got to Aidan &gt;<br>
<br>
Daily Mail article : A voice told me to shave my head and go to Australia': Epiphany of heir to £115m country estate who gave up fortune to go whale watching - Napier Marten <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2287349/A-voice-told-shave-head-Australia-Epiphany-heir-115m-country-estate-gave-fortune-whale-watching.html" class="postlink">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/articl ... ching.html</a> <br>

Napier Marten is the UK coordinator of the Parvati Foundation which I've explained many times now is deeply connected to NXIVM, the UN and the Supreme Master Ching Hai <a href="https://parvati.org/who-we-are/" class="postlink">https://parvati.org/who-we-are/</a><br>

A sonnet for Napier Marten <a href="https://aidanandrewdun.com/a-poem-for-napier-marten/" class="postlink">https://aidanandrewdun.com/a-poem-for-napier-marten/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Here’s a poem for a special friend. Napier Marten is the founder of Mirthquake, a frontline site for the pooling of knowledge about cetaceans. ..</div></blockquote>

That's written by London poet Aidan Andrew Dun <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/15/poetry" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/15/poetry</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Aidan Andrew Dun grew up in the West Indies, returning to London as a teenager then travelling around the world for more than a decade before writing his first epic poem, Vale Royal, (Goldmark, 1995). Launched at the Royal Albert Hall, it led to him being dubbed as the <span style="color:#FFFF40">'voice of King's Cross'</span>. ..</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://aidanandrewdun.com/about/" class="postlink">https://aidanandrewdun.com/about/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A former protégé of Walcott, Aidan Andrew Dun is younger than the other poets reviewed here and far less known. Published in beautiful editions by Goldmark, a branch of the art gallery which also first discovered the equally numinous prose of Ian Sinclair , Dun operates almost completely outside the orthodoxies of the poetry world. </div></blockquote>

I always felt there was something 'off' about Walcott but I can't remember what triggered that thought. .. Aidan wants to 'transform' London .. his website is interesting..<br>

For once, Switzerland cannot complain about a lack of attention. The American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is staying in our country for three days as part of his seven-day trip to Europe. Central program items were a private visit to the federal city of Bern, participation in the international Bilderberg conference of decision-makers in Montreux and on Sunday a working meeting with the Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis in Bellinzona. One can generously overlook the fact that Pompeo's meeting with Cassis was the first visit by a US Secretary of State for bilateral talks with his counterpart in Switzerland in around twenty years.</div></blockquote></div>

Babel is an arm of Rainbow Cultural Garden. I have even seen an ad on tv for them. Scared me. When researching it before I found that Barbara Bush had ties to London RCG. It’s been scrubbed. She died not long after. I remember reading a specialist interviewed the Children in the programs and he said the words came out as Gibberish. Frightening. These people should be hung at the soonest possible hour IMO. Thank you for looking into this<img alt="♥️" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/2665.svg">

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Count Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo is preparing a human trafficking network right now either from Mexico into the United States or from Asia into the US through the ports managed by Yakuza or the Triads while overseen by La Cosa Nostra. The Mexican human traffickers work with the Chicago Outfit and have a network through Nevada and New Mexico. The Adragna and Lanza crime families in California have a network with the Tijuana Cartel. All of Hollywood should be under criminal investigation right now for sex trafficking and human sacrifice and especially Dwayne Johnson, RZA, Olivia Wilde, Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, <span style="color:#FF0040">Joseph Gordon Levitt</span>, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Eminem, Will Smith, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Brad Pitt</span>, David Duchovny, and Angelina Jolie.<br>
<br>
 Also the Greek merchant shipping companies are involved with various ports in the United States and around the world and are involved with human trafficking. The mafia all operate at the ports. It is La Cosa Nostra, Greek Mafia, Albanian Mafia, Mexican Mafia, Armenian Mafia, and Irish Mafia most of all. Street gangs like MS-13 are their soldiers. The Hells Angels and other biker gangs often work in the trucking industry and work with mafias. This recent bombing in NYC was done as an excuse to increase security for their human trafficking operation from the Jersey ports into NYC. New Haven, Connecticut has a human trafficking operation as well used as a back up when Elizabeth, New Jersey is vulnerable. These people involved with human trafficking especially of children are completely ruthless, murderous, terroristic, and use any covert and extreme measures to protect themselves. They are brotherhoods and sisterhoods of pedophiles. They are sexual sadists. Most of them don't look like the creepy Podesta or Weinstein. This needs to be taken serious and this needs to end now.<br>

The Passi de Preposulo family are a Venetian-Lombardy nobility that still have a palace in Bergamo today. The family were mediators between the Guelph and Ghibelline factions however they were also architects of this division. The name Passi refers to a pass and their location having control over the road to Switzerland. The control over this region made families like the Passi de Preposulo's extremely wealthy. The name Preposulo refers to preparation.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/q5oufx.jpeg" class="postimage" alt="Image"> US actor Brad Pitt on an earlier visit to Art Basel. (Image: <span style="color:#FF0040">GEORGIOS KEFALAS</span> (KEYSTONE))</div></blockquote> Brad Pitt was in St. Gallen. A private trip to Europe has taken the US actor and art lover to Glastonbury, London, Zurich and Venice, among other places, according to various media reports. What was not known before: He also visited Eastern Switzerland. As the companion of a New York artist, Pitt paid a lightning visit of around four hours to the St.Galler Kunstgiesserei. Various sources and eyewitnesses confirm this to our newspaper. There is talk of a secret major order from the artist, about whose name nothing is known to date.<br>
<br>
The Kunstgiesserei St.Gallen remains silent on request. Felix Lehner, the founder and managing director, leaves a written question unanswered, the employee on the phone only escapes "How do you know that ?!" And then: "No comment. We won't say anything about that."<br>
<br>
Behind the scenes it was learned that Pitt was "open-minded and easy-going". He had the boss and production manager show him the company, where some of the most influential contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons, Paul McCarthy or Urs Fischer have their sculptures made. <br>
<br>
The Oscar-winning film producer has been a fan and collector of contemporary art for years. Pitt pays regular visits to Art Basel and renowned Swiss galleries. During his stay in Switzerland, he was also seen in the Kunsthaus Zurich,...<br>
<br>
In his first interview since the spectacular separation from his wife Angelina Jolie, Pitt told GQ magazine in early May that he spent a lot of time in Los Angeles in the studio of his friend, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the British artist Thomas Houseago</span>. There he made sculptures and tried his hand at materials such as clay, plaster, reinforcing steel or wood. Working with his hands is good for him, although it is a very lonely occupation. It is not known whether Brad Pitt plans to have his own sculptures made in St.Gallen one day. After his visit to Switzerland, he traveled on to Venice and London, where, according to "Hollywood Life", he is said to have met his ex-wife and their six children.</div>
