			<div class="content">This is a chapter from one the most important works of <em class="text-italics">Freemasonry: Morals &amp; Dogma of the Free and Accepted Masons</em>, by Albert Pike. Albert Pike, who was called the "titan of Freemasonry", is buried in the House of the Temple; the main seat of the Scottish Rite in America, located 13 blocks away from the White House. This book was systematically given to freemasons as they advanced through the degrees; it was intended as study material.<br>
<br>
Chapter XXX, <em class="text-italics">Knight Kadosh</em>, is one of the most important chapters of the book. It discusses the Templars, gnosticism and the origins of Freemasonry. In case you don't know who they are, they were a military order which originally served the purpose of protecting pilgrims to the Holy Land (Jerusalem). Which is curious, since there were only 9 knights... They set their HQ in the Al Aqsa Mosque, allegedly built on the ruins of the Temple of Solomon, and began a work of investigation. Over time, they became very powerful, becoming the first international bankers; they were tax-exempt and responded only to the Pope. Eventually, their power was so threatening that the king of France and the Papacy accused them of devil worshipping and other sacrilegious acts. The order was officially dissolved and its wealth transfered to the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem (which would go on to be known as the Knights of Malta). The order is said to have survived in the Order of Christ in Portugal, one of the few countries which didn't persecute them.<br>
<br>
Legends say that they discovered esoteric knowledge in the Middle East, that they moved to Scotland and fought along Robert the Bruce, that they founded Freemasonry, plotting revenge against the Papacy and that its naval assets were destined to piracy; becoming the pirates we all know and love, among many other tales. Some of these are true, or at least there's evidence to consider them at least partially true.<br>
<br>
I know it's long, but read the paragraphs. I'll walk you through them, and will translate their meaning, because I know this is a cryptic text which requires being versed in esotericism, history and other stuff.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FFBF00">"This idea presided at the foundation of the great religious orders, so often at war with the secular authorities, ecclesiastical or civil. Its realization was also the dream of the dissident sects of Gnostics or Illuminati who pretended to connect their faith with the primitive tradition of the Christianity of Saint John.</span> It at length became a menace for the Church and Society, when <span style="color:#FFBF00">a rich and dissolute Order, initiated in the mysterious doctrines of the Kabalah, seemed disposed to turn against legitimate authority the conservative principle of Hierarchy, and threatened the entire world with an immense revolution.<br>
</span><br>
"<span style="color:#FFBF00">The Templars, whose history is so imperfectly known, were those terrible conspirators</span>. In 1118, nine Knights Crusaders in the East, among whom were Geoffroi de Saint-Omer and Hugues de Payens, consecrated themselves to religion, and took an oath between the hands of the Patriarch of Constantinople, a See always secretly or openly hostile to that of Rome from the time of Photius. <span style="color:#FFBF00">The avowed object of the Templars was to protect the Christians who came to visit the Holy Places: their secret object was the re-building of the Temple of Solomon on the model prophesied by Ezekiel.</span><br>
<br>
"This re-building, formally<span style="color:#FFBF00"> predicted by the Judaïzing Mystics of the earlier ages, had become the secret dream of the Patriarchs of the Orient</span>. The Temple of Solomon, re-built and consecrated to the Catholic worship would become, in effect, <span style="color:#FFBF00">the Metropolis of the Universe;</span> the East would prevail over the West, and the Patriarchs of Constantinople would possess themselves of the Papal power.</div></blockquote>

The templars were secretly students of the esoteric doctrines of kabbalah and gnosticism, which intended to rebuild the Temple of Solomon; which is also an allegory for human society and the human body. An equivalent of it is the unfinished pyramid or the incomplete tower of Babel; it represents the fallen state of humanity, separated from its original, divine source.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"The Templars, or Poor Fellow-Soldiery of the Holy House of the Temple intended to be re-built, took as their models, in the Bible, the Warrior-Masons of Zorobabel, who worked, holding the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other. Therefore it was that the Sword and the Trowel were the insignia of the Templars, who subsequently, as will be seen, <span style="color:#FFFF40">concealed themselves under the name of Brethren Masons</span>. [This name, Frères Masons in the French, adopted by way of secret reference to the Builders of the Second Temple, was corrupted in English into Free-Masons, as Pythagore de Crotone was into Peter Gower of Groton in England. Khairu_m or Khu_r-u_m, (a name mis-rendered into Hiram) from an artificer in brass and other metals, became the Chief Builder of the Haikal Kadosh, the Holy House, of the Temple, the Ἱερος Δομος; and the words Bonai and Banaim yet appear in the Masonic Degrees, meaning Builder and Builders.]</div></blockquote>

Here Pike admits Freemasonry descended from the Templars<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"<span style="color:#40BFFF">The secret thought of Hugues de Payens, in founding his Order, was not exactly to serve the ambition of the Patriarchs of Constantinople. There existed at that period in the East a Sect of Johannite Christians, who claimed to be the only true Initiates into the real mysteries of the religion of the Saviour. They pretended to know the real history of YESUS the ANOINTED, and, adopting in part the Jewish traditions and the tales of the Talmud, they held that the facts recounted in the Evangels are but allegories, the key of which Saint John gives</span>, in saying that the world might be filled with the books that could be written upon the words and deeds of Jesus Christ; words which, they thought, would be only a ridiculous exaggeration, if he were not speaking of an allegory and a legend, that might be varied and prolonged to infinity.<br>
<br>
"<span style="color:#FF0040">The Johannites ascribed to Saint John the foundation of their Secret Church, and the Grand Pontiffs of the Sect assumed the title of Christos, Anointed, or Consecrated, and claimed to have succeeded one another from Saint John by an uninterrupted succession of pontifical powers</span>. He who, at the period of the foundation of the Order of the Temple, claimed these imaginary prerogatives, was named <span style="color:#FFBF00">THEOCLET; he knew HUGUES DE PAYENS, he initiated him into the Mysteries and hopes of his pretended church, he seduced him by the notions of Sovereign Priesthood and Supreme royalty, and finally designated him as his successor.</span></div></blockquote>

The templars took many elements from talmudism, gnosticism and kabbalah; also known as "the mysteries". The mysteries is a term used in this, and many other works, to refer to the hidden teachings of secret societies, which are all the same at their core. Only the outer shell is different.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Thus<span style="color:#FF40BF"> the Order of Knights of the Temple was at its very origin devoted to the cause of opposition to the tiara of Rome and the crowns of Kings, and the Apostolate of Kabalistic Gnosticism was vested in its chiefs</span>. For <span style="color:#00FF00">Saint John himself was the Father of the Gnostics</span>, and the current translation of his polemic against the heretical of his Sect and the pagans who denied that Christ was the Word, is throughout a misrepresentation, or misunderstanding at least, of the whole Spirit of that Evangel.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF40FF">"The tendencies and tenets of the Order were enveloped in profound mystery, and it externally professed the most perfect orthodoxy. The Chiefs alone knew the aim of the Order: the Subalterns followed them without distrust.</span><br>
<br>
"<span style="color:#FFBF00">To acquire influence and wealth, then to intrigue, and at need to fight, to establish the Johannite or Gnostic and Kabalistic dogma, were the object and means proposed to the initiated Brethren. The Papacy and the rival monarchies, they said to them, are sold and bought in these days, become corrupt, and to-morrow, perhaps, will destroy each other. All that will become the heritage of the Temple: the World will soon come to us for its Sovereigns and Pontiffs. We shall constitute the equilibrium of the Universe, and be rulers over the Masters of the World.</span><br>
<br>
"<span style="color:#FFBF00">The Templars, like all other Secret Orders and Associations, had two doctrines, one concealed and reserved for the Masters, which was Johannism; the other public, which was the Roman Catholic.Thus they deceived the adversaries whom they sought to supplant. Hence Free-Masonry, vulgarly imagined to have begun with the Dionysian Architects or the German Stone-workers, adopted Saint John the Evangelist as one of its patrons, associating with him, in order not to arouse the suspicions of Rome, Saint John the Baptist, and thus covertly proclaiming itself the child of the Kabalah and Essenism together."</span><br>
<br>
[For <span style="color:#00BFFF">the Johannism of the Adepts was the Kabalah of the earlier Gnostics</span>, degenerating afterward into those heretical forms which Gnosticism developed, so that even Manes had his followers among them. Many adopted his doctrines of the two Principles, the recollection of which is perpetuated by the handle of the dagger and the tesserated pavement or floor of the Lodge, stupidly called "the Indented Tessel," and represented by great hanging tassels, when it really means a tesserated floor (from the Latin tessera) of white and black lozenges, with a necessarily denticulated or indented border or edging. And wherever, in the higher Degrees, the two colors white and black, are in juxtaposition, the two Principles of Zoroaster and Manes are alluded to. With others the doctrine became a mystic Pantheism, descended from that of the Brahmins, and even pushed to an idolatry of Nature and hatred of every revealed dogma.</div></blockquote>

<strong class="text-strong">The goal was to take over the world</strong>. Notice how they mention the idea of an inner and outer creed, a trademark of all secret societies.<br>
<br>
If Freemasonry descends from the templars, which wanted to impose the "gnostic-kabbalistic dogma" upon the world... What is the goal of Freemasonry, then?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>[To all this <span style="color:#FF40FF">the absurd reading of the established Church, taking literally the figurative, allegorical, and mythical language of a collection of Oriental books of different ages</span>, directly and inevitably led. The same result long after followed the folly of regarding the Hebrew books as if they had been written by the unimaginative, hard, practical intellect of the England of James the First and the bigoted stolidity of Scottish Presbyterianism.]
</div></blockquote>

Secret societies and other enlightened groups of men knew that the stories of the bible and other myths were allegories to explain and conceal secret teachings which would be outside the scope of the uneducated masses.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FFBF00">"The better to succeed and win partisans, the Templars sympathized with regrets for dethroned creeds and encouraged the hopes of new worships, promising to all liberty of conscience and a new orthodoxy that should be the synthesis of all the persecuted creeds."</span></div></blockquote>

Uniting all religions, freedom of conscience... Sounds familiar?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>[<span style="color:#00FF40">It is absurd to suppose that men of intellect adored a monstrous idol called Baphomet, or recognized Mahomet as an inspired prophet. Their symbolism, invented ages before, to conceal what it was dangerous to avow, was of course misunderstood by those who were not adepts, and to their enemies seemed to be pantheistic.</span> The calf of gold, made by Aaron for the Israelites, was but one of the oxen under the laver of bronze, and the Karobim on the Propitiatory, misunderstood.<span style="color:#FF0080"> The symbols of the wise always become the idols of the ignorant multitude. What the Chiefs of the Order really believed and taught, is indicated to the Adepts by the hints contained in the high Degrees of Free-Masonry, and by the symbols which only the Adepts understand.</span></div></blockquote>

Again; enlightened men didn't actually believe in idols. And again, Pike recognizes that freemasonry is templarism.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>[<span style="color:#00FFFF">The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry. The whole body of the Royal and Sacerdotal Art was hidden so carefully, centuries since, in the High Degrees, as that it is even yet impossible to solve many of the enigmas which they contain. It is well enough for the mass of those called Masons, to imagine that all is contained in the Blue Degrees; and whoso attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain, and without any true reward violate his obligations as an Adept. Masonry is the veritable Sphinx, buried to the head in the sands heaped round it by the ages.]</span></div></blockquote>

Not all masons are in on the true goals and teachings of Freemasonry.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"The seeds of decay were sown in the Order of the Temple at its origin. Hypocrisy is a mortal disease. It had conceived <span style="color:#FF0000">a great work</span> which it was incapable of executing, because it knew neither humility nor personal abnegation, because Rome was then invincible, and because the later Chiefs of the Order did not comprehend its mission. Moreover, the Templars were in general uneducated, and capable only of wielding the sword, with no qualifications for<span style="color:#00FF00"> governing</span>, and at need enchaining, that queen of the world called Opinion." [The doctrines of the Chiefs would, if expounded to the masses, have seemed to them the babblings of folly. <span style="color:#00FF80">The symbols of the wise are the idols of the vulgar, or else as meaningless as the hieroglyphics of Egypt to the nomadic Arabs. There must always be a common-place interpretation for the mass of Initiates, of the symbols that are eloquent to the Adepts.</span>]</div></blockquote>

Great work is a term used in alchemy, thelema and other esoteric doctrines to mean the regeneration of the self; reuniting with God (see above). It is the same as finishing the pyramid or the temple. In this context, it means a world regime based on certain esoteric teachings. Next time you read GREAT WORK, you know it has more than one meaning.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Hughes de Payens himself had not that keen and far-sighted intellect nor that grandeur of purpose which afterward distinguished the military founder of another soldiery that became formidable to kings.<span style="color:#00FF40"> The Templars were unintelligent and therefore unsuccessful Jesuits.</span></div></blockquote>

Jesuits are the successors of the templars.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Their watchword was,<span style="color:#FFFF00"> to become wealthy, in order to buy the world.</span> They became so, and in 1312 they possessed in Europe alone more than nine thousand seignories. Riches were the shoal on which they were wrecked. They became insolent, and <span style="color:#FF4040">unwisely showed their contempt for the religious and social institutions which they aimed to overthrow</span>. Their ambition was fatal to them. Their projects were divined and prevented. [Rome, more intolerant of heresy than of vice and crime, came to fear the Order, and fear is always cruel. It has always deemed philosophical truth the most dangerous of heresies, and has never been at a loss for a false accusation, by means of which to crush free thought.] Pope Clement V. and King Philip le Bel gave the signal to Europe, and the Templars, taken as it were in an immense net, were arrested, disarmed, and cast into prison. Never was a Coup d’Etat accomplished with a more formidable concert of action. The whole world was struck with stupor, and eagerly waited for the strange revelations of a process that was to echo through so many ages.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">"It was impossible to unfold to the people the conspiracy of the Templars against the Thrones and the Tiara. It was impossible to expose to them the doctrines of the Chiefs of the Order. [This would have been to initiate the multitude into the secrets of the Masters, and to have uplifted the veil of Isis. Recourse was therefore had to the charge of magic, and denouncers and false witnesses were easily found. </span> When the temporal and spiritual tyrannies unite to crush a victim they never want for serviceable instruments.] The Templars were gravely accused of spitting upon Christ and denying God at their receptions, of gross obscenities, conversations with female devils, and the worship of a monstrous idol.</div></blockquote>

Again; dominate the world through wealth. Notice the expression "the veil of Isis". Madame Blavatsky would release her book <em class="text-italics">Isis Unveiled</em> in which she explains this secret doctrine.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"The end of the drama is well known, and how Jacques de Molai and his fellows perished in the flames. But <span style="color:#40BFFF">before his execution, the Chief of the doomed Order organized and instituted what afterward came to be called the Occult, Hermetic, or Scottish Masonry.</span> In the gloom of his prison, the Grand Master created four Metropolitan Lodges, at Naples for the East, at Edinburg for the West, at Stockholm for the North, and at Paris for the South." [<span style="color:#00FFBF">The initials of his name, J∴ B∴ M∴ found in the same order in the first three Degrees, are but one of the many internal and cogent proofs that such was the origin of modern Free-Masonry. The legend of Osiris was revived and adopted, to symbolize the destruction of the Order, and the resurrection of Hiram, slain in the body of the Temple, of Hiram Abiff, the Master, as the martyr of fidelity to obligation, of Truth and Conscience, prophesied the restoration to life of the buried association.]</span></div></blockquote>

The legend of Osiris and Hiram Abiff is very similar; a "lost word" or "generative principle" and the resurrection. They represent the same as building the temple, finishing the pyramid, the tower of babel, etc. The completion of an individual by reuniting with his divine source.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0000">"The Pope and the King soon after perished in a strange and sudden manner. Squin de Florian, the chief denouncer of the Order, died assassinated. In breaking the sword of the Templars, they made of it a poniard; and their proscribed trowels thence-forward built only tombs."</span></div></blockquote>

Can you guess whodunnit? Some legends say that the wind blew the flames away from De Molay's body, and that he cursed his killers before dying.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>[The Order disappeared at once. <span style="color:#FF80FF">Its estates and wealth were confiscated, and it seemed to have ceased to exist. Nevertheless it lived, under other names and governed by unknown Chiefs, revealing itself only to those who, in passing through a series of Degrees, had proven themselves worthy to be entrusted with the dangerous Secret. The modern Orders that style themselves Templars have assumed a name to which they have not the shadow of a title.</span>]<br>
<br>
"The<span style="color:#00FFBF"> Successors of the Ancient Adepts Rose-Croix, abandoning by degrees the austere and hierarchial Science of their Ancestors in initiation, became a Mystic Sect, united with many of the Templars, the dogmas of the two intermingling</span>, and believed themselves to be the sole depositaries of the secrets of the Gospel of St. John, seeing in its recitals an allegorical series of rites proper to complete the initiation.<br>
<br>
"The Initiates, in fact, t<span style="color:#00FF80">hought in the eighteenth century that their time had arrived, some to found a new Hierarchy, others to overturn all authority, and to press down all the summits of the Social Order under the level of Equality."</span><br>
<br>
The mystical meanings of the Rose as a Symbol are to be looked for in the Kabalistic Commentaries on the Canticles.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF80FF">The Rose was for the Initiates the living and blooming symbol of the revelation of the harmonies of being. It was the emblem of beauty, life, love, and pleasure. Flamel, or the Book of the Jew Abraham, made it the hieroglyphical sign of the accomplishment of the great Work.</span> Such is the key of the Roman de la Rose. The Conquest of the Rose was the problem propounded to Science by Initiation, while Religion was laboring to prepare and establish the universal triumph, exclusive and definitive, of the Cross.</div></blockquote>

The red rose is also the symbol of international socialism.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FFBF00">Cagliostro was the Agent of the Templars, and therefore wrote to the Free-Masons of London that the time had come to begin the work of re-building the Temple of the Eternal.</span> He had introduced into Masonry a new Rite called the Egyptian, and endeavored to resuscitate the mysterious worship of Isis. The three letters L∴ P∴ D∴ on his seal, were the initials of the words<span style="color:#FFBF00"> "Lilia pedibus destrue;" tread under foot the Lilies [of France], and a Masonic medal of the sixteenth or seventeenth century has upon it a sword cutting off the stalk of a lily, and the words "talem dabit ultio messem," such harvest revenge will give.</span><br>
<br>
A Lodge inaugurated under the auspices of Rousseau, the fanatic of Geneva, became the centre of the revolutionary movement in France, and<span style="color:#FFBF00"> a Prince of the blood-royal went thither to swear the destruction of the successors of Philippe le Bel on the tomb of Jacques de Molai. The registers of the Order of Templars attest that the Regent, the Duc d’Orleans, was Grand Master of that formidable Secret Society</span>, and that his successors were the Duc de Maine, the Prince of Bourbon-Condé, and the Duc de Cossé-Brissac.<br>
<br>
The Templars compromitted the King; they saved him from the rage of the People, to exasperate that rage and bring on the catastrophe prepared for centuries; it was a scaffold that the vengeance of the Templars demanded.<span style="color:#FFBF00"> The secret movers of the French Revolution had sworn to overturn the Throne and the Altar upon the Tomb of Jacques de Molai.When Louis XVI. was executed, half the work was done; and thenceforward the Army of the Temple was to direct all its efforts against the Pope.</span> <br>
<br>
Jacques de Molai and his companions were perhaps martyrs, but their avengers dishonored their memory. Royalty was regenerated on the scaffold of Louis XVI., the Church triumphed in the captivity of Pius VI., carried a prisoner to Valence, and dying of fatigue and sorrow, but <span style="color:#FFBF00">the successors of the Ancient Knights of the Temple perished, overwhelmed in their fatal victory.</span></div></blockquote>

The Templars, and their descendents (freemasons, rosicrucians, and others) did the French Revolution. This idea was also supported by other freemasons and by occultist Eliphas Levi.<br>
