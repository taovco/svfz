In the box Mario Draghi, former ECB president</span></em></div></blockquote>

<span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank, after presenting yesterday the list of his 23 ministers to the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella is ready to go to Parliament,...<br>
<br>
Only Brothers of Italy by Giorgia Meloni, for consistency, has distanced itself from the great binge of ministerial seats by deciding not to support the nascent Draghi government.<br>
<br>
...But if Draghi is ready to take the reins of Italy, Gospa News is also ready to reveal all the “dangerous” relations not only of his, between chastisement and international financial lobbies to which he refers, but also of some of his technical ministers who will take on highly strategic positions although they have embarrassing conflicts of interest that connect them to George Soros and Bill Gates, the two megadonors of the US Democratic Party who, after the nomination of their candidate Joseph Biden as president, will be able to establish a perfect “theatercracy” in which even characters  authoritative like Draghi himself will risk being “puppets” in the hands of these two puppeteers.<br>
<br>
Next to them, as emissaries of the New World Order in Italy, there are obviously Giorgio Napolitano and Sergio Mattarella who not only both come from the establishment of the Italian Democratic Party, having become authoritative after the election of Dem Barack Obama in the US in 2009, but, as we will see in the next installments of the “NWO conspiracy against Italy” dossier, they were the perfect directors of the choice of the former ECB president to bind Rome more and more to Brussels with financial pacts that no government of any future election will ever be able to more to break, just like the seigniorage of private banks (members of the ECB spa) imposed by the Treaty of Maastrict on the single currency that became a halt for Italy when the penalizing lira-euro exchange rate was set at £ 1,936.27 thanks to the advice of Draghi to government chaired by Romano Prodi, future PD leader....<br>
<br>
Subsequently, the same risky research with Gain of Function (the enhancement of the viral load for “dual use” vaccine-bioweapon purposes) was also conducted in the USA thanks to the PREDICT project financed by the Obama-Biden administration thanks to the USAID agency, a financial tool for foreign missions of the CIA intelligence together with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation.<br>
<br>
For now we limit ourselves to publishing the list of ministers (at bottom of article) so that the most expert in geopolitics understand who the future rulers may be to whom we will dedicate investigations and who will be the custodians of the future control of the health emergency but above all the socio-economic pandemic that, to because of the lockdowns</span></div></blockquote></div>

New IT Minister among Bilderberg, McKinsey, Gates &amp; CIA for Artificial Intelligence in Vaccines too</span> <a href="https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/02/18/nwos-plot-against-italy-x-file-2-new-it-minister-among-bilderberg-mckinsey-gates-cia-for-artificial-intelligence/" class="postlink">https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/02/18 ... elligence/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">In a previous prophetic article we defined the Task Force wanted by the former premier Giuseppe Conte and by the President of the Republic <span style="color:#FFFF40">Sergio Mattarella a “shadow government”</span> which in fact represented a duplicate of the national executive, precisely for this reason subsequently frozen by the President of the Council.<br>
<br>
We wrote it on April 17, 2020 highlighting the qualified and sparkling profile of globalism of Professor Vittorio Colao who has now been called to be one of the spearheads of the new government of former ECB President Mario Draghi (confirmed by the confidence of the Senate with 262 votes in favor, 40 against and 2 abstentions), for a clear “plot of the New World Order against Italy” fomented by the Deep International State as a hidden expression of the financial, Masonic, political and military potentates.<br>
<br>
Colao (Brescia, October 3, 1961) is an Italian company executive, CEO of Vodafone from 2008 to 2018 and from February 13, 2021 Minister for Technological Innovation and Digital Transition in the Draghi Government...<br>
<br>
..What obviously the colleagues of the Italian Mainstream Media forgot to remember is that Colao is also one of the reference managers of the well-known supra-massive lobbyist group Bilderberg. But they also failed to report that among the top financiers of McKinsey, recently stolen in the US by a Big Pharma consulting conviction on the lethal opioid scandal, is the usual Bill Gates, IT guru and big promoter. of artificial intelligence which in North America is already projected into two strategic and extremely delicate sectors: health care and military.<br>
<br>
...Colao, after graduating from Bocconi University in Milan and a Masters in Business Administration from Harvard University, had a brief stint at the Morgan Stanley investment bank in London before making a career in McKinsey &amp; Company, a leading international management company. We will see later the importance of his role there … In 1996 at Omnitel when the largest shareholder is Carlo De Benedetti’s Olivetti, card no. 1 in the future Democratic Party, publisher of the GEDI Group of the L’Espresso-Repubblica-La Stampa newspapers in which <span style="color:#FF0040">the Agnelli-Elkann family of the FIAT-FCA group, known throughout the world for 111 years of trials for various allegations of corruption</span>.<br>
<br>
FROM THE BILDERBERG TO THE GAVI PROJECT OF GATES<br>
And here the first intrigues begin. <span style="color:#FF0040">John Elkann, president of Fiat Crysler Automobile, with administrative headquarters in the Netherlands and fiscal headquarters in the United Kingdom but under investigation in the US by the administration of Donald Trump, is a member of the Standing Committee of Bilderberg together with Lilli Gruber, journalist of TG LA7 led by Enrico Mentana, founder of the online newspaper Open and fans of George Soros.</span> Club Bilderberg’s annual private meetings between lobbyists from around the world were inaugurated in 1954 by David Rockefeller, brother of the politician Nelson, who became famous in secular-globalist history for having imposed the abortion law when he was Governor of the State of New York.<br>
<br>
As reported by BlastingNews, that of 2018 was held from 7 to 10 June in Turin and, together with the two Italians already mentioned, also Vittorio Colao, <span style="color:#FF0040">Elena Cattaneo, director of the Stem Cell Biology Laboratory at the University of Milan</span>, was appointed senator for life by President Napolitano, and the Roman economist Mariana Mazzucato, director and founder of the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at <span style="color:#FF0040">University College London</span> where she teaches.<br>
<br>
Mazzuccato has a double passport having grown up in the United States, she is a member of the Council for the Future of Growth and Competitiveness of the World Economic Forum in Davos, she became Conte’s economic advisor before being appointed to the Colao Emergency Task Force.<br>
<br>
The academic lecturer, in her acclaimed book The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy, revealed the “secret of Pulcinella”: that companies from Silicon Valley to the financial sector to Big Pharma have used nebulous notions of value to create confusion between rents and profits, describing themselves as creators of values but ending up destroying them, as noted in an essay article by former judge and economist Paolo Maddalena, emeritus vice president of the Constitutional Court. But to present his publication Mazzuccato was a distinguished guest at George Soros’ Open Society Foundation in New York.<br>
<br>
The Hungarian-American plutarch, known for the Soros list of friendly MEPs and his meeting in 2017 at Palazzo Chigi with the former Italian premier Paolo Gentiloni (Democratic Party) today EU commissioner, in 2011 was one of the major investors of Verizon Communication ( $ 64.954 million in the first quarter, given US Securities and Exchange Commission OMB # 3235-0006 dated 8/31/12) where Colao worked in Cellco Partnership before becoming independent director in 2019.<br>
<br>
..Colao «in 2012 he created the partnership Vodafone – GAVI Vaccine Alliance (WHO, UNICEF, Gates Foundation, World Bank) to computerize the vaccinations of children in sub-Saharan Africa – writes Cianti on his Facebook profile – In 2015 he was non-executive director in UNILEVER (food corp, 400 brands, 53 billion turnover in the hands of the usual well-known Vanguards, Black Rock, Wellington Management, etc. ..). But in 2018, Vodafone turnover collapsed to 2.8 billion with 6.1 billion in losses and Colao was kicked out with a liquidation in shares of over 33 million dollars. <span style="color:#FF0040">It is on this occasion that he turns to Bill Gates with whom he entertains for dinner in Seattle</span>».<br>
<br>
GATES AND CIA PARTNERS OF MCKINSEY<br>
The new head of the Task Force can therefore well consider himself a foreign manager as he resides with his wife and two children in South Kensington, Greater London (UK). And it is precisely in the talked about world-wide management consulting group McKinsey &amp; Company of New York (also based in Rome and all over the world) that he made a career from 1986 to 1996.....<br>
<br>
«For the past four years, the powerhouse firm McKinsey and Co., has helped restructure the country’s spying bureaucracy, aiming to improve response time and smooth communication. Instead, according to nearly a dozen current and former officials who either witnessed the restructuring firsthand or are familiar with the project, the multimillion dollar overhaul has left many within the country’s intelligence agencies demoralized and less effective. These insiders said the efforts have hindered decision-making at key agencies — including the CIA, National Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence» told reporter Natasha Bertrand and Daniel Lippman.<br>
<br>
..Vox, on the other hand, highlights how the company has turned into a think-tank financed by powerful billionaires to influence the directions of world management. It publishes some graphs showing the huge funding invested in McKinsey since the foundation of Bill Gates who, as we have seen in a previous article, collaborated with a former CIA deputy director for the simulated exercise on the pandemic Event 201, held in New York in October 2019 when SARS-Cov-2 had not even been officially discovered yet…<br>
<br>
THE CHALLENGE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<br>
The former executive of the American counter-espionage Central Intelligence Agency in Langley (Virginia) to which we refer is the lawyer Avril Haines, who later became National Security Advisor of the White House during the Obama-Biden administration (2015-2017) and in January was awarded by Joseph Biden, the new president of the USA, with the role never assigned to a woman of Director of National Intelligence to which all the civilian and military 007 of the nation belong.<br>
<br>
Haines, formerly Biden’s advisor to Congress, is also an expert on biological weapons in the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a non-profit organization that claims to be bi-partisan but was founded by former Senator Dem Sam Nunn, former president of the Committee on the US Senate Armed Forces, and funded by Warren Buffet, Gates partner in Microsoft Coroporation, of which Emma Natasha Walmsley, CEO of GlaxoSmithKline, the vaccine giant that controls Pfizer’s commercial sector, is executive director.....<br>
<br>
VACCINES BUILT WITH AI<br>
..<br>
<br>
“Researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) have unveiled an incredibly powerful, AI-powered method for producing new potential Covid-19 vaccine candidates in a matter of minutes or even seconds.” Russia Today unveiled in recent days. The new process, developed at the <span style="color:#FFFF40">USC Viterbi School of Engineering</span>, could mark a major turning point in the information war against the coronavirus and its many, increasingly virulent mutations which are taxing an already challenging worldwide vaccine rollout.<br>

Disturbing Conflicts of Interest from Italy to the UK</span> <a href="https://www.gospanews.net/en/2020/11/14/wuhan-gates-23-from-cambridge-big-pharmas-cartel-controls-swabs-vaccines-and-clinical-trials-disturbing-conflicts-of-interest-from-italy-to-the-uk/" class="postlink">https://www.gospanews.net/en/2020/11/14 ... to-the-uk/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">It is spelled One Nucleus, but it reads the Big Pharma cartel. The headline sponsor is AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Dutch multinational controlled by the shareholders of the Weapons Lobby, which has come under the spotlight for clinical trials on the vaccine against Covid-19, temporarily suspended in the United Kingdom and in the United States after two serious adverse reactions between human guinea pigs, and for the mysterious death of a young volunteer medeico in Brazil. But with her there is also Johnson &amp; Johnson, the American pharmaceutical giant convicted several times for health crimes.<br>
<br>
..Established in 1997, One Nucleus is an award winning not-for-profit Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare membership organisation centred on the Greater London-Cambridge-East of England corridor. Headquartered in Cambridge, at the heart of Europe’s largest Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare cluster..In that same area, AstraZeneca has developed a partnership with GSK, or GlaxoSmithKline, the other London vaccine multinational controlled by the same US investment funds and convicted several times in the courts. ..<br>
<br>
ADULTERATED SWABS IN TANZANIA<br>
<br>
..This Big Pharma cartel in which the ring of economic interests closes, obviously for the good of shareholders more than humanity, <span style="color:#FFFF40">is even more suspicious if it is noted that most of the new infections in Italy, albeit at 95% asymptomatic as claimed by many world-famous virologists such as Professor Giorgio Palù, academic in Padua and Philadelphia, have emerged in Lombardy and Piedmont precisely where the Italian branch of Cerba operates which in the last three years, from 2017 to October 2019, has acquired the most important laboratory chains in northern Italy </span>as if in a crystal ball he had intuited the future business deriving from the epidemic of the new Coronavirus strain.<br>
<br>
...Among the first to think badly was John Pombe Magufuli, the very Christian president of Tanzania (reconfirmed at the head of the nation since the elections at the end of October), <span style="color:#FF0040">who had the swabs received as a gift from the African section of the World Health Organization</span> tested and found positive Covid-19 a goat, a quail and even a papaya. The purchasing manager of the Ministry of Health was fired on the spot and the story ended up in many global counter-information media curious to know who had produced those swabs that someone suspected were “used” and therefore already positive.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Gospa News revealed that they came from a donation from the Jack Ma Foundation</span>, a self-styled Chinese philanthropic organization created by the owner of Alibaba, the main Asian E-commerce platform that was enriched like Amazon during the period of lockdowns in China and other Eastern countries. thanks to the closure of retail and wholesale stores...<br>
<br>
... Stefano Massaro, CEO of Cerba HealtCare Italia..<br>
<br>
...First of all, it should be noted that the European nations in which Cerba operates are among those at the top in the explosion of autumn infections. Among the countries most affected are in fact France, where the diagnostic laboratory has its headquarters in Paris and collaborates with the national government, Italy, which we will talk about more specifically later, and Luxembourg where it has an important headquarters the diagnostics multinational that presents itself as a European leader in the sector but operates in 16 countries through various partnerships (including China and Africa).<br>
<br>
But the most striking case is represented by Belgium. «Cerba Research Proud to be part of Government Task Force in combat against Covid-19. The Belgian Taskforce to combat Covid-19 has taken off! Cerba Research and sister company, CRI, have engaged to be a vital part of the government-led consortium, alongside PPD, JnJ, GSK, Biogazelle, UCB ULiège, Sciensano, ThermoFisher, UgenTec and MIPS. Together, we will work to upscale Covid-19 testing in Belgium».<br>
<br>
...This is what was already read in March on the website of the same group, citing among the partners GlaxoSmithKline, managed by a non-executive director of Microsoft Corporation and financed in various research on vaccines by the foundation of Bill Gates, but also Johnson &amp; Johnson, another pharmaceutical giant with various judicial convictions, which is a partner of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Eco Health Alliance of New York</span>.<br>
<br>
EHA a global non-profit organization for environmental health that financed the EPT-PREDICT projects, commissioned by the Barack Obama US administration and funded by the American government agency USAID, operational tool of the Central Intelligence Agency, on the extremely dangerous experiments on bat superviruses in Wuhan with the SARS-1 genotype infected with HIV, the pathogen of AIDS...<br>

			<div class="content">Magufuli passed away on Wednesday, 17th March 2021, from heart complications at a hospital in Dar es Salaam where he was receiving treatment. The vice president of Tanzania announced his death on state television. Read more: <a href="https://www.tuko.co.ke/406473-john-pombe-joseph-magufuli-bio-wife-children-tribe-death-education-career.html" class="postlink">https://www.tuko.co.ke/406473-john-pomb ... areer.html</a><br>
<br>
Magufuli was a prominent skeptic of the coronavirus. He had not been seen in public since the end of February, fueling speculation he was ill and possibly incapacitated.<br>
<br>
Magufuli is pictured as the Trump of Africa (negatively) in this article written by a black female Tanzanian who studied at Univ of Nottingham (known for covid studies  and it's China campus) and currently at Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison( the state with the phony absentee ballots).<br>
<br>

<br>
Magufuli's opposition who has been in Belgium for the last 3 years calls Magufuli's death from "covid" "poetic justice".<br>
CIA justice?<br>

			<div class="content">@<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3189" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">HennyPenny</a> Thank you for an interesting comment. Those links you provided are anti-Trump, anti-populism, pro-COVID scam articles.. so I'm taking a closer look at the writers of those articles as they give us more names for the SWAMP database... so the black Tanzanian (second author of that piece) is Aikande Clement Kwayu <a href="https://qz.com/author/aikande-clement-kwayu/" class="postlink">https://qz.com/author/aikande-clement-kwayu/</a>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I have a PhD in Politics and International Relations. My research has largely been on Religion and Politics, from which I have published a book titled <span style="color:#FFFF40">"Religion in British International Development"</span> (2020) by Palgrave Macmillan. I am currently doing research on Party Politics in Tanzania with focus on parties' use of social media in an autocratic context.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Her book on Amazon gets favorable reviews from: Duncan Green, Senior Strategic Adviser, <span style="color:#FF0040">Oxfam</span>; Wilfred Mlay, former Vice-President of <span style="color:#FF0040">World Vision</span> International, Africa Region; Amy Stambach, Director of Global Studies and Professor of Educational Policy Studies and Anthropology at the<span style="color:#FF0040"> University of Wisconsin-Madison</span>; Dr. Aikande C. Kwayu, <span style="color:#FF0040">University of Wisconsin-Madison</span><br>
<br>
<br>
We have posts on World Vision (connected to DS shill Meghan Markle), Oxfam and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br>
<br>
Amy Stambach and Aikande C. Kwayu have written research papers together, like: <em class="text-italics"><em class="text-italics">Confucius Institutes</em> in Africa, or How the Educational Spirit in Africa is Re-Rationalised</em> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aikande-Kwayu" class="postlink">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aikande-Kwayu</a><br>
<br>
We have posts on the Confucius Institutes as well. They are notorious spy centers for the Chinese and feature in the COVID scamdemic story: <span style="color:#00FF40">In Galway there is a building marked as a "Covid test site," the building is a confucius institute funded by the PRC as a "Chinese cultural center"</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/politics/4130538" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/politics/4130538</a></div></blockquote>

Other articles from Dr. Aikande C. Kwayu are really eye opening in terms of how Western missionaries allied with the UN are infiltrating Africa under the cover of 'charity work' and shaping the continent through their political activism.<br>
<br>
Now let's get to the FIRST author of your article, a white Brit : <a href="https://qz.com/author/danpaget/" class="postlink">https://qz.com/author/danpaget/</a> .. Dr. Dan Paget is a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Political Science at <span style="color:#FF0040">University College London</span>. He's really the driver of the hit piece on the deceased Tanzanian president. He wrote a far more favorable article on Magufuli in 2017. I find his closing paragraphs quite interesting: <a href="https://africanarguments.org/2017/11/2-years-on-tanzanias-magufuli-isnt-a-bulldozer-hes-a-magician/" class="postlink">https://africanarguments.org/2017/11/2- ... -magician/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In this sense too, Magufuli is a magician. He is a performer, adept in show business and displays of wonder. “The Bulldozer” is a guise that the public invented for him, an image of straightforwardness that cloaks the deftness with which he deals in words as well as deeds.<br>
<br>
We ought to learn from Frank Baum’s novels, immortalised in The Wizard of Oz. Dorothy’s adventures in Oz are children’s stories, but also works of satire and deep wisdom. They contain an old truth that where there is a magician, or wizard, one should not only admire his accomplishments, but the look for the man behind the curtain, and see how his greatness is constructed, and what purposes it serves.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...you may not know that the concept for National Public Radio was born within the storied walls of The Johnson Foundation's Wingspread, in Racine, Wisconsin.<br>
<br>
In the late 60s, the radio industry was struggling to remain relevant. In 1967, the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television concluded a successful two-year campaign to acquire public funding for educational television when Congress, under President Johnson, passed the Public Television Act. Challenged yet again by the seemingly insurmountable visual appeal of the flourishing medium of television, the fate of radio seemed sealed.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the launch of the Carnegie campaign in 1965, hope for radio prevailed in the passionate leadership of its own Jerrold Sandler. Then Director of National Education Radio, Sandler began an effort to convene a meeting of radio’s finest for a conference he entitled “Educational Radio as a National Resource.” Intending to match the prestige of the Carnegie-led television movement, Sandler enlisted the support of The Johnson Foundation and requested space at the Foundation’s own Frank Lloyd Wright designed venue, Wingspread.<br>
<br>
Sandler’s project matched perfectly with the Foundation’s mission and purpose: “The Foundation shall be an instrument for creative programs which serve man….”  Supporting education, growth, freedom, and community were part of the Foundation’s early statement of purpose. Preserving the communication shared over the country’s airwaves was a project the Foundation could easily embrace.<br>
<br>
The three-day meeting took place at Wingspread in September of 1966. What resulted was a set of specific action steps designed to convince members of Congress that radio deserved equal billing with television in the pending Public Television Act. The eventual result of the Wingspread meeting: congress issued and passed an amended bill. The Public Broadcasting Act authorized the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to act as a funding and policy making agency. National Public Radio was incorporated in February of 1970. A meeting that ended very well – All Things Considered.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I’m doing some interesting work with Tom Kirk at LSE as part of the CPAID research programme, on the way donors/aid agencies understand power (aka ‘public authority’) in fragile/conflict settings. ..<br>
<br>
In 2014, World Vision’s Johan Eldebo and colleagues set about designing a tool for conducting rapid, yet socially grounded contextual analyses in the middle of escalating crises. The team’s big idea was to systematise and scale up the informal ways that information was being gathered in such places. The result was the ‘Good Enough Context Analysis for Rapid Response’ tool or GECARR, for short.<br>
<br>
.......<em class="text-italics">Tom was in Zimbabwe as part of a wider project undertaken with <span style="color:#FF0040">Duncan Green to examine how Oxfam, World Vision and Mercy Corps</span> understand, engage and involve public authority in their programming in FCVAS.</em></div></blockquote>

Observing COVID-19 in Africa through a public authorities lens - Edited by <span style="text-decoration:underline">Professor Duncan Green and Dr Tom Kirk</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Most discussion of Africa’s response to COVID-19 takes place at the national level, focussing on the role of formal state authorities. However, less is known about the role of ‘public authorities’: traditional chiefs, self-help groups, kinship networks, professional associations, faith-based groups, civil society organisations, multinational companies, humanitarian agencies, organized criminal gangs, militias and rebels. These often operate below the national level and are particularly important in areas where the state is weak or absent.<br>
<br>
To explore this gap, researchers at the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Centre for Public Authority and International Development CPAID)</span> were asked to provide vignettes of life under, and public authorities’ responses to, the pandemic in the places they intimately know: northern Uganda, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone.

In 1993, in response to his experience with the Club of Rome, he founded the Club of Budapest to, in his words, "centre attention on the evolution of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors in changing course — from a race towards degradation, polarization and disaster to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics and global sustainability"<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Akashic field theory</span><br>
László's 2004 book, Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything posits a field of information as the substance of the cosmos. Using the Sanskrit and Vedic term for "space", Akasha, he calls this information field the "Akashic field" or "A-field". He posits that the "quantum vacuum" (see Vacuum state) is the fundamental energy and information-carrying field that informs not just the current universe, but all universes past and present (collectively, the "Metaverse").<br>
<br>
László believes that such an informational field can explain why our universe appears to be fine-tuned so as to form galaxies and conscious lifeforms; and why evolution is an informed, not random, process. He believes that the hypothesis solves several problems that emerge from quantum physics, especially nonlocality and quantum entanglement.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">The Immortal Mind</span><br>
László became interested in the consciousness theories of Anthony Peake, (who in turn was an admirer of László’s work on the Akashic Field). Peake, whose background was in the social sciences,[8] had sought to explain the fact that altered states of consciousness (such as deja vu, dreams, psychedelic drug experiences, meditation, near death experience) sometimes seem to feature precognition and premonitions.[9] Peake had produced a tentative synthesis of the ancient idea of the "Eternal Return" with modern ideas like the simulation argument, the holographic universe, and the many worlds interpretation. In Peake’s hypothesis, one lives variants of the same life repeatedly, and a premonition is in fact a memory of the past.[10] Peake became a Consciousness Studies Department Member at Ervin László’s Center For Advanced Studies.[11] László collaborated with Anthony Peake on the book The Immortal Mind: Science and the Continuity of Consciousness Beyond the Brain.<br>
<br>
Macroshift theory<br>
In his book You Can Change the World, László promotes a linking of non-government organizations promoting sustainable development, using the Internet.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Stanford can be described as one of the "jewels" in <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#FF0040">Tavistock</span></span>'s Crown in its rule over the United States. Founded in 1946 immediately after the close of WW II, it was presided over by Charles A. Anderson, with emphasis on mind control research and "future sciences." Included under the Stanford umbrella was Charles F. Kettering Foundation which developed the "Changing Images of Man" upon which the Aquarian Conspiracy rests.<br>
<br>
Some of Stanford's major clients and contracts were at first centered around the defense establishment but, as Stanford grew, so did the diversity of its services:<br>
<br>
Applications of Behavioral Sciences to Research Management. Office of Science and Technology. SRI Business Intelligence Program. U.S. Department of Defense Directorate of Defense Research and Engineering. U.S. Department of Defense Office of Aerospace Research. Among corporations seeking Stanford's services were Wells Fargo Bank, Bechtel Corporation, Hewlett Packard, Bank of America, McDonnell-Douglas Corporation, Blyth, Eastman Dillon and TRW Company. One of Stanford's more secret projects was extensive work on chemical and bacteriological warfare (CAB) weapons...<br>
<br>
Schriever put together a consortium of Lockheed, Emmerson Electric, Northrop, Control Data, Raytheon and TRW under the name of URBAN SYSTEMS ASSOCIATES, INC. The purpose of the consortium? To solve social and psychological "urban problems" by means of military techniques using advanced electronic systems. It is interesting to note that TRW became the largest credit information collecting company in the credit reporting business as a result and an outcome of its work with Urban Systems Associates, Inc...<br>
<br>
But one of the most sinister of all SRI programs with the possibilities of doing tremendous damage in altering the direction in which the United States will go, socially, morally and religiously, was Stanford's Charles F. Kettering Foundation's "CHANGING IMAGES OF MAN" under Stanford official reference "Contract Number URH (489)-2150 Policy Research Report Number 4/4/74, Prepared by the SRI Center for the Study of Social Policy, Director Willis Harmon." This is probably one of the most far-reaching investigations into how man might be changed that has ever been conducted.<br>
The report, covering 319 pages, was written by 14 new science scientists under the supervision of Tavistock and 23 top controllers including <span style="color:#FF0040">B. F. Skinner, Margaret Meade, <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Ervin Lazlo</span> and Sir Geoffrey Vickers, a high-level British intelligence officer in M16</span>. It will be recalled that his son-in-law, Sir Peter Vickers Hall, was a founding member of the so-called conservative "Heritage Foundation." Much of the 3000 pages of "recommendations" given 71 to the Reagan administration in January 1981 were based upon material taken from Willis Harmon's "CHANGING IMAGES OF MAN."<br>
<br>
I was privileged to receive a copy of "THE CHANGING IMAGES OF MAN" from my intelligence colleagues five days after it was accepted by the United States government. What I read shocked me, as I realized I was looking at a blueprint for a future America, unlike anything I had ever seen before. The nation was to be programmed to change and become so accustomed to such planned changes that it would hardly be noticeable when profound changes did occur. We have gone downhill so fast since "THE AQUARIAN CONSPIRACY" (the book title of Willis Harmon's technical paper) was written, that today, divorce draws no stigma, suicide is at an all time high and raises few eyebrows, social deviations from the norm and sexual aberrations, once unmentionable in decent circles, are now commonplace and excite no special protest.

<br>
Among Blue's biggest achievements was in securing the funding needed to enforce the protection of the no-take marine reserve created by the UK government around the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. At the time of creation in 2010 it was the world's biggest marine reserve. The money came from the Bertarelli Foundation and covered the first five years after which the government promised to internalise the costs and enforce the reserve.[30][31][32] Henry Bellingham, a UK junior Foreign Office minister, described the initiative as a "great example" of government and the private sector working together and said the reserve would "double the global coverage of the world's oceans benefiting from full protection".</div></blockquote>
