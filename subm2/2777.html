Those screenshots in that last tweet were from <a href="https://www.paderborn.de/tourismus-kultur/download/HareStory-new.pdf" class="postlink">https://www.paderborn.de/tourismus-kult ... ry-new.pdf</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A „Hare Story“<br>
There are three hares and only three ears, and yet each hare has two.<br>
<br>
The Three-Hares-Window in the late Gothic cloister of the Paderborn<br>
Cathedral is not only one of the town’s landmarks but at the same time the<br>
most famous Three-Hares-Motif in Germany.<br>
The hare is a popular motif in both Christian as well as profane art. It can often be found, for<br>
instance, in paintings and other pieces of art, and it holds a versatile imagery. In non-sacral art,<br>
the hare is often used to represent the prey animal on depictions of hunting scenes. Usually, it<br>
can also be seen on spring or fall images where the springing hare stands for happiness. Due to<br>
its distinct reproductive instinct, the hare is often interpreted to be a symbol of fertility and<br>
physical love....<br>
<br>
Frequently, hares can be found in a group of three. They are<br>
rarely ever absent from depictions of Creation and have therefore<br>
become a symbol for the Trinity of God. The arrangement of<br>
three hares in a circle, as in the famous Three-Hares-Window in<br>
Paderborn, however, is an exception. When looking at the<br>
window, not the animals themselves should be in the viewer’s<br>
focus but rather their ears: Each hare has two ears, although<br>
there are only three ears in the whole picture. Through this<br>
connection, a circle is formed. <br>
<br>
This special Three-Hares-Motif can often be encountered in Germany, for example, in the coat<br>
of arms of the municipality of Hasloch, in the monastery of Hardehausen near Paderborn as well<br>
as in the Cathedral of Münster. However, there are many examples of the motif in other<br>
countries and cultures all over the world. The three hares are present in other European<br>
countries, for instance, in Switzerland as a painting from 1529 at the church of Lauen near<br>
Gstaad, in the monastery of Muotathal near Schwyz or as part of a wrought-iron fence in the<br>
village museum of Riehen which is situated between Basel and Lörrach. In France, the hares<br>
can be found in the late Gothic Palais des Maison du Cardinal Jouffroy in Luxeuil-les-Bains and<br>
in the courtyard of the Alsatian St.-Peter-and-Paul church in Wissembourg...In Great Britain, the<br>
motif of the three hares in a circle can be encountered in numerous churches such as, for<br>
example, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the Long Melford Trinity Church in the county of<br>
Suffolk.</span> However, the symbol is also quite popular<br>
outside of Europe, especially in Asia: The ThreeHares-Symbol can be found in many different places<br>
ranging from Egypt to China and was presumably<br>
brought from China to Europe along the Silk Road.<br>
The original meaning of the Three-Hares-Motif is<br>
unclear, but throughout the centuries many possible<br>
interpretations have emerged...</div></blockquote>

All of those places mentioned are relevant to us... the article goes on to describe the various theories about the 3 hares.. I've come to my own theory... ...<br>

Three Hares <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_hares" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_hares</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The three hares (or three rabbits) is a circular motif or meme appearing in sacred sites from the Middle and Far East to the churches of Devon, England (as the "Tinners' Rabbits"),[1] and historical synagogues in Europe.[2] It is used as an architectural ornament, a religious symbol, and in other modern works of art[3][4] or a logo for adornment (including tattoos),[5] jewelry, and a coat of arms on an escutcheon.[6][7] It is viewed as a puzzle, a topology problem or a visual challenge, and has been rendered as sculpture, drawing, and painting...<br>
<br>
The symbol features three hares or rabbits chasing each other in a circle. Like the triskelion,[8] the triquetra, and their antecedents (e.g., the triple spiral), the symbol of the three hares has a threefold rotational symmetry. Each of the ears is shared by two hares, so that only three ears are shown. Although its meaning is apparently not explained in contemporary written sources from any of the medieval cultures where it is found, it is thought to have a range of symbolic or mystical associations with fertility and the lunar cycle. When used in Christian churches, it is presumed to be a symbol of the Trinity. Its origins and original significance are uncertain, as are the reasons why it appears in such diverse locations..<br>
<br>
In Western Europe<br>
The motif of the three hares is used in a number of medieval or more recent European churches, particularly in France (e.g., in the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière in Lyon)[21] and Germany. It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of Devon, England where it appears to be a recollection of earlier Insular Celtic design such as the triaxially symmetric triskele and other Romano-British designs which are known from early British 'Celtic' (La Tène) metalwork such as circular enamelled and openwork triskel brooches (fibulae). The motif appears in illuminated manuscripts amongst similar devices such as the anthropomorphic "beard pullers" seen in manuscripts such as the Book of Kells,[22] architectural wood carving, stone carving, window tracery and stained glass. In South Western England there are over thirty recorded examples of the three hares appearing on 'roof bosses' (carved wooden knobs) on the ceilings in medieval churches in Devon, (particularly Dartmoor). There is a good example of a roof boss of the three hares at <span style="color:#FF0040">Widecombe-in-the-Moor,[8] <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Dartmoor</span></span>, with another in the town of <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Tavistock </span></span>on the edge of the moor. The motif occurs with similar central placement in Synagogues.[2] Another occurrence is on the ossuary that by tradition contained the bones of St. Lazarus...<br>
<br>
As an optical illusion or puzzle<br>
Jurgis Baltrusaitis's 1955 Le Moyen-Âge fantastique. Antiquités et exotismes dans l'art gothique[30] includes a 1576 Dutch engraving with the puzzle given in Dutch and French around the image. This is the oldest known dated example of the motif as a puzzle, with a caption that translates as:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">The secret is not great when one knows it.<br>
But it is something to one who does it.<br>
Turn and turn again and we will also turn,<br>
So that we give pleasure to each of you.<br>
And when we have turned, count our ears,<br>
It is there, without any disguise, you will find a marvel.</em><br>

Notice the different references to related designs and locations, some of which I will continue with in the comments. Note in particular the reference to the  Borromean rings.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings</a> <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/srfzmf.png" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/srfzmf.png</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This one is quite interesting. Do you see the Borromean rings ?

The 3 hares are also found in Judaism <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_hares" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_hares</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In Judaism, the "shafan" in Hebrew has symbolic meaning.[C] Although rabbits are listed as a non-kosher animal in the Bible—they at least arguably chew their cud[D] lacking cloven hooves—rabbits can carry very positive symbolic connotations, like lions and eagles. 16th century German scholar Rabbi Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, saw the rabbits as a symbol of the Jewish diaspora. ..<br>
<br>
The hare frequently appears in the form of the symbol of the "rotating rabbits". An ancient German riddle describes this graphic thus:<br>
<br>
Three hares sharing three ears,<br>
Yet every one of them has two.[2]<br>
<br>
This curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous wooden synagogues from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the Ashknaz region (in Germany) that are on museum display in Beth Hatefutsoth Museum in Tel Aviv, the Jewish Museum Berlin and The Israel Museum in Jerusalem. They also appear in the Synagogue from Horb am Neckar (donated to the Israel Museum). The three animals adorn the wooden panels of the prayer room from Unterlimpurg near Schwäbisch Hall, which may be seen in replica in the Jewish Museum Berlin. ...  Israeli art historian Ida Uberman wrote..." ...The fact that they are always three is important, for that number . . . is important in the Kabbalistic context"..<br>
<br>
Not only do they appear among floral and animal ornaments, but they are often in a distinguished location, directly above the Torah ark, the place where the holy scriptures repose..They appear on headstones in Sataniv (Сатанів), Khmelnytsky Oblast, western Ukraine. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/felicenaomi/videosandfilms3" class="postlink">https://sites.google.com/site/felicenao ... sandfilms3</a> [<em class="text-italics">It is not clear how the three rotating leporids found their way from medieval and Gothic churches into the Jewish world of Ashkenaz. But the fact is they can be found in all of the famous preserved wooden synagogues of the 17th and 18th century in the Ashkenazic regions from Germany to Eastern Europe.</em>]
</div></blockquote>

And that has taken me down a whole other rabbit hole which I'll leave for now..<br>
<br>
So, just to make a point about those locations mentioned above where 3 Hares are found:  Dartmoor in the UK is synonymous with the Moors murders, a story of pedophilia and murder. Some people speculate that the narrative given to the general public hides a deeper story.. Jimmy Savile's name appears <a href="http://aangirfan.blogspot.com/2013/06/jimmy-savile-child-murderers-top-people.html" class="postlink">http://aangirfan.blogspot.com/2013/06/j ... eople.html</a><br>

You can read about the town Tavistock in Devon in this pizzagate post by @<a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1709" style="color: #B44747;" class="username-coloured">kestrel9</a> : The many coincidences surrounding TAVISTOCK <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3191757" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3191757</a><br>

So, let's look at Widecombe in the Moor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widecombe_in_the_Moor" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widecombe_in_the_Moor</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Widecombe in the Moor (/ˌwɪdɪkəm ... ˈmʊər/) is a village and large civil parish on Dartmoor National Park in Devon, England. Its church is known as the Cathedral of the Moors on account of its tall tower and its size, relative to the small population it serves. ... The church of St Pancras is known as the "Cathedral of the Moors" ..inside,  the ceiling is decorated with a large number of decorative roof bosses, including the tinner’s emblem of a circle of three hares (known locally as the Tinners' Rabbits).<br>
<br>
In popular culture<br>
In the reality show Celebrity Ghost Stories, American actor Daniel Stern claimed to have had an unsettling, and possibly supernatural, experience while on a brief visit to the village during his honeymoon in 1980. He also recounted that people in the region considered Widecombe to be haunted, and that the Great Thunderstorm of 1638 was blamed. The official Widecombe-in-the-Moor website responded to the claims and dismissed the alleged hauntings as a legend borne of superstitions.[5][6]<br>
<br>
In 2010, Widecombe-in-the-Moor was one of the filming locations for the <span style="color:#FF0040">Steven Spielberg film War Horse.</span></div></blockquote>

The play got an unusual amount of press at the time .. so it's stuck with me because I felt it meant something more.<br>

The town developed into the center of the County of Wertheim. The county was governed by the House of Löwenstein-Wertheim. In 1630, the house split into two lines: the older Protestant line Löwenstein-Wertheim-Virneburg and the Catholic line Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort...<br>

<br>
The Origin and Migration of the Three Hares <a href="https://chinesepuzzles.org/three-hares/" class="postlink">https://chinesepuzzles.org/three-hares/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Beginning in the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), Dunhuang was an important stop on the Silk Road, the ancient trade route that stretched from Chang’an (present-day Xi’an) in the east to Central Asia, India, Persia—and, eventually, the Roman Empire—in the west. And during the period of the Sixteen Kingdoms (304–439), at Mogao, less than a day’s journey from Dunhuang, Buddhist monks began digging out hundreds of cave temples from the cliffs along the Daquan River. The caves were decorated with statues, murals, and decorative images, and construction of new caves continued at Mogao for over five hundred years.<br>
<br>
During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties, three-hares images were painted on the center of the ceilings of at least seventeen caves. Typically, the circle of hares is surrounded by large lotus petals and forms the focal point of a painted canopy covering the entire ceiling. <br>
<br>
....The three-hares images found in the Mogao Caves are the earliest known examples, but it’s unlikely that the motif originated there. It may have reached Mogao under Sogdian or Sasanian influence, with origins in Mesopotamia, <span style="color:#FF0040">or even the Hellenistic world</span>. What is known is that in addition to the Buddhist images found at Mogao, Guge, and Ladakh, early examples of the motif also occur in Islamic and Christian contexts along in a path that extends more than eight thousand kilometers westward to southwest England.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Rabbits are sacred to Aphrodite, the goddess of love, beauty, and marriage -- for rabbits have “the gift of  Aphrodite” (fertility)  in great abundance. In ancient Greece, the gift of a rabbit was a common love token from a man to his male or female lover; in Rome, the gift of a rabbit was intended to help a barren wife conceive. Carvings of rabbits eating grapes and  figs appear on both Greek and Roman tombs, where they symbolize the transformative cycle of life, death, and rebirth.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Hares are associated with the Artemis, goddess of wild places and the hunt</span>, and newborn hares are not to be killed but left to her protection.  In Teutonic myth, the earth and sky goddess Holda, leader of the Wild Hunt is followed by a procession of hares bearing torches. Although she has descended into a witch–like figure and boogeyman of children’s tales, she was once revered as a beautiful, powerful goddess in charge of weather phenomena. Freyja, the headstrong Norse goddess of love, sensuality and women’s mysteries, is also served by hare attendants. She travels with a sacred hare and boar in a chariot drawn by cats.<br>
<br>
Kaltes, the shape–shifting moon goddess of western Siberia, likes to roam the hills in the form of a hare, although she is usually pictured in human form, wearing a headdress with hare’s long ears. Ostara, the goddess of the moon, fertility and spring in Anglo–Saxon myth, is often depicted with a hare’s head or ears, and with a <span style="color:#FF0040">white hare standing in attendance</span>. This magical white hare lays brightly colored eggs which, in centuries past, were given out to children during spring fertility festivals. This ancient tradition that survives in the form of the Easter Bunny today.</div></blockquote>

Pedophilia in Ancient Greece and Rome <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/pedophilia-ancient-greece-rome/" class="postlink">https://www.thecollector.com/pedophilia ... eece-rome/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>While the practice of pedophilia today is a morally wrong and illegal act, some of the Ancient Greeks and Romans regarded it as a common practice and sometimes something to be celebrated. Pedophilia was common in Greek and Roman mythology and daily life...Forms of pedophilia were common among nobility and were often seen as rites of passage for the youth involved in them. ..<br>
<br>
The Romans were not as open to the practice of pederasty, as they were not open to many of the Greek ideals or ways of life. The ways of the Greeks were often seen as beneath them, despite the fact that a lot of Roman culture and myth is taken and expanded upon from the Greeks. The Romans would pursue sexual relationships with younger men, but these relationships were only seen as forgivable if the older man was a freeborn Roman and he was having sex with a younger slave or prostitute who wasn’t of Roman origin...<br>
<br>
It should be noted that the younger boys involved in pederastic relationships were often of the same age as young girls who were set into arranged marriages with much older men, around the ages of 12 to 16. This occurred in both Greek and Roman culture. The rituals of marriage symbolized a girl becoming a woman, just as a pederastic relationship symbolized a boy becoming a man. <br>
<br>
...In Greece, the proaulia was an entire day before the wedding dedicated to rites, sacrifices, and ritual baths to prepare the bride. The bride would give sacrifices of her childhood toys, locks of hair and her girdle, a woven or rope belt symbolizing her virginity, to goddesses like <span style="color:#FF0040">Artemis</span>, Aphrodite, Athena and Hera.</div></blockquote>

This curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous wooden synagogues from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the Ashknaz region (in Germany) that are on museum display in Beth Hatefutsoth Museum in Tel Aviv, .... they are often in a distinguished location, directly above the Torah ark, the place where the holy scriptures repose..They appear on headstones in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sataniv (Сатанів), Khmelnytsky Oblast, western Ukraine</span>. </em>..&gt;<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sataniv" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sataniv</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sataniv (Ukrainian: Сатанів, Russian: Сатанов, Polish: Satanów) is an urban-type settlement in the Horodok Raion, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, Ukraine. Population: 2,367 (2020 est.)..<br>
<br>
A Jewish community was organized in Sataniv in the second half of the 16th century, in the kingdom of Poland. Jews in Sataniv were involved in the import of goods from the east, leasing of estates and customs dues, manufacture of alcoholic drinks, and goldsmithery. The town was periodically attacked by the Tatars and Cossacks, including combined attacks in 1651 and from the Cossacks in 1703. The synagogue in Sataniv was built as a fortress to allow the Jews and the wider community to defend themselves in such attacks.<br>
<br>
In the 18th century Sataniv was Podolia's leading community. In 1756 its dayyanim (religious judges) held a trial of the Frankists. In 1765 there were 1,369 Jews paying the poll tax in Sataniv. The Jews there were involved in international commerce, traveling to fairs in Leipzig, Breslau, and Frankfurt, until 1793, when Sataniv was incorporated into Russia.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew writer and maskil<span style="color:#FF0040"> Isaac Satanow</span> lived in Sataniv, and was active there in the latter half of the 18th century. He, Menachem Mendel Lefin, and Alexander b. Ẓevi Margaliot, all of whom also lived in the town, were among the pioneers of the Haskalah movement. From the end of the 18th century and during the 19th, Sataniv was an important center of Hasidism.<br>
<br>
Until 1862 the Jewish settlement there was restricted by the authorities, because of Sataniv's closeness to the Austrian border. The Jewish population was 2,848, 64% of the total, in 1897. In 1919, Jews in Sataniv underwent pogroms by Ukrainian nationalists. In 1926 Satanov probably had 2,359 Jews, then declining to 1,516, or 40% of the total population. A rural Jewish council existed in the Soviet period. On 6 July 1941 the Germans entered Sataniv, and on 14 [15(?)] May 1942 they locked 286 Jews into two cellars, letting them suffocate. (The Remains of the 286 victiums were found July 27.2020).[4] Throughout 1942, 210 Jews were shot. The Germans murdered 800 people according to official numbers, most of them Jews</div></blockquote>

He is referenced numerous times in at least 33 other seforim as an apparently authoritative source. He also received approbations for some of his works from numerous respected rabbis of his generation.<br>
<br>
Yet he is regarded by many as a supreme charlatan.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Daniel Itzig (also known as Daniel Yoffe 18 March 1723 in Berlin – 17 May 1799 in Potsdam) was a Court Jew of Kings Frederick II the Great and Frederick William II of Prussia...<br>
<br>
Itzig was born in Berlin. His family was mercantile. Itzig was a banker and a mintmaster in partnership with Veitel Heine Ephraim. Together they leased all the mints in Saxony and Prussia. During the Seven Years' War they assisted Frederick the Great in debasing the Saxonian currency[1] and spreading the Ephraimiten, not only in Saxony, but also in Silesia, Poland, Bohemia and Courland.<br>
<br>
Itzig was one of the very few Jews in Prussia to receive full citizenship privileges, as a "Useful Jew". He became extraordinarily wealthy as a consequence.<br>
<br>
Together with his son in law David Friedlander, Itzig was appointed to lead a committee which was to discuss ways to improve the Jewish civil and social standing in Prussia, which led to the removal of many restrictions. He funded early members of the Haskalah secular movement, including Rabbi Israel of Zamosch (Moses Mendelssohn's teacher), Samuel Rominow (an Italian Jewish artist) and Isaac Satanow.<br>
<br>
In 1761 he began planning a school for poor Jewish boys in Berlin, and in 1778 his son together with Daniel Friedlander opened the first "free school" (Freischule) called "Hinuch Neorim", Hebrew: 'Teaching the Youth'. The school and adjacent printing house later became one of the main institutions of the Haskalah movement. At the same time he founded and funded a Yeshiva and brought Rabbi Hirschel Levin and Rabbi Joseph ben Meir Teomim to Berlin to teach there.<br>
<br>
Itzig was the official head ('Oberältester') of the Jewish community in Berlin from 1764 until his death in 1799...<br>
His wife Miriam Wulff's ancestors included Rabbi Moses Isserles of Cracow and Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon.[4] Many of Itzig's thirteen children (see Itzig family) became influential in German Jewish society. Two of his granddaughters married two of Moses Mendelssohn's sons. One of them was Lea (née Solomon), mother of Felix Mendelssohn and Fanny Hensel, a pianist and composer. By her, Lea was grandmother of mathematician Kurt Hensel. A non-Jewish descendant of Daniel Itzig was Wilhelm Cauer.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankism" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankism</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Frankism was a Sabbatean Jewish religious movement of the 18th and 19th centuries,[1] centered on the leadership of the Jewish Messiah claimant Jacob Frank, who lived from 1726 to 1791. Frank rejected religious norms, and said his followers were obligated to transgress as many moral boundaries as possible. At its height it claimed perhaps 50,000 followers, primarily Jews living in Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe.<br>
<br>
..Frankism is associated with the Sabbateans of Turkey, a religious movement that identified the 17th-century Jewish rabbi Sabbatai Zevi as the Messiah.[1][3] Like Frankism, the earlier forms of Sabbateanism believed that at least in some circumstances, antinomianism was the correct path.[7] Zevi himself would perform actions that violated traditional Jewish taboos, such as eating foods that were forbidden by kashrut (Jewish dietary laws) and celebrating prescribed fast days as feast days.[8] Especially after Zevi's death, a number of branches of Sabbateanism evolved, which disagreed among themselves over which aspects of traditional Judaism should be preserved and which discarded.[9] The more radical branches even engaged in sexual foreplay.[10] In Frankism, orgies featured prominently in ritual...<br>
<br>
After Jacob Frank's death in 1791, his daughter Eve, who had been declared in 1770 to be the incarnation of the Shekhinah, the dwelling of the divine presence, continued to lead the movement with her brothers.
</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Frank" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Frank</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Eve Frank or Eva Frank (1754 – 1816 or 1817)[1][2] born Rachel Frank in Nikopol, Ottoman Empire (now Bulgaria),[1] was a mystic cult leader, and the only woman to have been declared a Jewish messiah. She was the daughter of Jacob Frank..<br>
<br>
Her father Jacob spread the rumor that Eve, who was often called "Eva Romanovna" at that point, was an illegitimate child of Catherine II of Russia. Father and daughter repeatedly traveled to Vienna, and succeeded in gaining the favor of the court..<br>
<br>
Religious leader<br>
Upon the death of her father in 1791, Eve became the "holy mistress" and leader of the cult. Frank and her two younger brothers, Josef and Rochus, assumed responsibility for the direction of the court. Many people continued to go up to Offenbach am Main, to Gottes Haus, as the believers called it.<br>
<br>
In 1800, the Franks sent "red letters" (in red ink) to hundreds of Jewish communities encouraging conversion to Frankism.[4] However, the Frank siblings had neither the stature nor the strength of personality required to keep the cult going and as time went on the number of pilgrims and supply of money diminished drastically, all the while Eve had continued to live in her accustomed luxury. In November 1813, after the battle of Leipzig, Tsar Alexander I, then emperor of Russia, rode from Frankfurt to Offenbach to visit Eve..<br>
<br>
It was alleged that she died in poverty in 1816,[6] though she is believed to have escaped to Poland and continued to lead the community after the dismantling of the Frankist court and arrest order from the Duke of Hesse.[1][2] Nonetheless, her followers continued to exist well into the middle of 19th century. <span style="color:#FF0040">Among these were the parents of Louis Brandeis, the U.S. Supreme Court Justice.</span>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>An article in a British construction magazine confirms that the Freud family, who were behind psychoanalysis and the Tavistock Clinic, and who became involved in the Madeline McCann investigation through outed pedophile Clement Freud, are closely involved in the pizza and ping pong restaurant business. Matthew Freud, his nephew, appears to have been part of a multi-million pound investment in these restaurants, which was attended by Hollywood celebrities, London socialites and members of the pizza and ping pong club circuit...<br>
<br>
This Freud incest child molesting can be traced straight back to Sigmund Freud, and even further back to the founding of Frankist Jewish mysticism/Satanism, by Yacob Frank in the 1700s.<br>
<br>
It was the celebration of everything anti-social and counter-productive and counter-traditional, and it involved incest, child molesting, and orgies. Yacob Frank used his own daughter as the center of these ritual orgies. <span style="color:#FF0040">Supreme Court Chief Justice Louis Brandeis kept a picture of Yacob Frank's daughter on his Supreme Court desk. He came from a family of Frankists who arrived in the US with an agent of the Rothschilds, another Frankist family.</span><br>
<br>
Recall that Sigmund Freud had a very very weird relationship with his daughter, and gave her many "therapy" sessions to talk about her masturbation. And it was Freud who promoted the idea that everybody wants to fuck their mother. That's a Frankist subversive tactic. Freud was a member of the Vienna Austria B'Nai B'Rith, the Jewish masonic organization that was/is rooted in Frankism.<br>
<br>
Remember the movie Eyes Wide Shut? This is based on a novella written by another Vienna, Austria Frankist Jew, and it's about initiation into Frankism.<br>
<br>
Check this out and read the article:<br>
<br>
"Frankist Paradigm: The “Frankist Paradigm” is the set of neo-Frankist beliefs that have now metastasized across Western culture. These ideas find resonance in a multi-cultural society, where animosities brew under the surface and politics becomes a proxy for ethnic warfare. Without traditionalism, society becomes insipid and narcissistic, finding itself attracted to radical politics as a catharsis and a sadistic release. Without unity, society divides into warring factions. The Frankist Paradigm weaponizes these conflicts, producing a society of malcontents more interested in destruction and animosity than collective progress.

The caves contain some of the finest examples of Buddhist art spanning a period of 1,000 years.[1] Construction of the Buddhist cave shrines began in 366 C.E., as places to store scriptures and art.<br>
<br>
As a depository of pivotal Buddhist, Taoist, and Christian documents, the Mogao Caves provided a rare opportunity for Buddhist monks and devotees to study those doctrines. In that regard, the caves served as a virtual melting pot of Christian, Buddhist, Taoist, <span style="color:#FF0040">and even Hindu ideas</span> in China. The discovery of the caves that served as a depository of documents from those faiths, sealed from the eleventh century, testify to the interplay of religions. The Diamond Sutra and the Jesus Sutras stand out among the scriptural treasures found in the caves in the twentieth century.

Jewelry encrusted with gold leaf makes this seventh-century portrait of the Bodhisattva Guanyin seem three-dimensional—and thus more real. Depicted as a male figure in Indian Buddhism, Guanyin would gradually transform into a female in China, in part to accommodate older Chinese beliefs in a female goddess of mercy.

Guanyin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In Chinese mythology, Guanyin (觀音) is the goddess of mercy and considered to be the physical embodiment of compassion. She is an all-seeing, all-hearing being who is called upon by worshipers in times of uncertainty, despair, and fear. Guanyin is also a type of soil known for being eaten during the Great Chinese Famine, named after this goddess. Guanyin is originally <span style="color:#FF0040">based on the Hindu god Avalokiteśvara</span>. Avalokiteśvara’s myth spread throughout China during the advent of Buddhism and mixed with local folklore in a process known as Syncretism to become the modern day understanding of Guanyin. He is the one who is the dharma protector and who restores the peace in the world. His idols and temples are mostly found in mountains and hilly terrains (Kurunji regions). He has arupadai veedu (six war homes) in the modern Indian State of Tamil Nadu, which has nothing but temples and the Murugan (Guhan/kugan) idols, which are made with secret herbs by agasthiyar sitthar, and which can produce cosmic energy and the water/milk after getting down from the idol. They are valuable and considered as sacred (it is believed to contain medical properties to cure many diseases since the idol was made with secret herbs).<br>
<br>
In the Karandavyuha Sutra, Avalokiteshvara is called "The One with a Thousand Arms and Thousand eyes" and is described as superior to all gods and buddhas of the Indian pantheon.<br>
<br>
Association with vegetarianism<br>
Due to her symbolization of compassion, in East Asia, Guanyin is associated with vegetarianism. Buddhist cuisine is generally decorated with her image and she appears in most Buddhist vegetarian pamphlets and magazines.[38][39] In fact there is a soil named after her called "Guanyin Clay".

Harvard Divinity School - The Mogao Caves as Cultural Embassies<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In May 2016, the Getty Center in Los Angeles will present an ambitious exhibition on the spectacular painted cave temples.1 Through precious works of art loaned from European museums and the cave themselves, as well as photographs, videos, virtual immersion, and elaborate replica caves, the exhibition tells the story of one of the world’s greatest cultural treasures—its genesis and proliferation, its encounters with destructive threats from humans and nature, its miraculous survival over the course of more than fifteen hundred years, and most importantly, the intensive contemporary efforts to conserve and protect the caves for future generations....<br>
<br>
Three replica caves created at the Dunhuang Academy will be set up on the Getty Center’s arrival plaza for visitors to enter and experience. The caves’ artists will travel to Los Angeles for their installation. The replica caves were selected for their diverse content, which provides a hint of the broad range of subjects and styles seen at Mogao. One of the caves, reproduced from a fifth-century CE original, contains a bodhisattva sculpture identified as Maitreya, the future Buddha, and five painted stories of the Buddha’s past lives, or jātaka tales. Another, from the sixth century, contains the earliest inscription of any cave at Mogao, which takes meditation as one of its themes. Constructed in the square vihāra, or monastery, style from India, its wall paintings incorporate Hindu and indigenous Chinese deities into a Buddhist context. A cave from the eighth century CE contains a truncated pyramidal ceiling with a peony motif, illusionistic decorative tent hangings in the corners, and several miniature Buddhas. The cave includes stories of Amitābha, a monk who became a Buddha in the process of achieving enlightenment.

Sure. Keep in mind that I haven't watched the show at all because it has to be crap... but the title and the image were enough for me to know that the satanists are at work.. and I've come to the conclusion that human trafficking as we call it is another form of the slave trade. The same people are involved.<br>
<br>
It starts with the Orange Revolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution</a>  .. a political uprising in Ukraine connected to George Soros..<br>

<br>
Orange is the color worn by Gitmo inmates.  Look at the photo of the Netflix series Orange is the new Black. The one white girl in the middle of everyone else whose black.  What's the message?  We're all prisoners now.. <br>

6 years later in 2019:<br>
<br>
KITSCH - Singer and actress Arielle Dombasle has opened up a musical tribute to Notre Dame Cathedral. A cover of Ave Maria in its style to say the least… inimitable. <a href="https://www.lci.fr/people/video-arielle-dombasle-chante-l-ave-maria-pour-rendre-hommage-a-notre-dame-et-amuse-beaucoup-les-internautes-2118806.html" class="postlink">https://www.lci.fr/people/video-arielle ... 18806.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Since the fire that devastated part of Notre-Dame Cathedral, the stars have not stopped sharing their emotion on social networks. From Marion Cotillard to Omar Sy via Jean Dujardin, Gad Elmaleh, but also Garou and all the cast of the musical Notre-Dame de Paris, all expressed their sadness on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.<br>
<br>
And then there is Arielle Dombasle. This Wednesday evening, the singer and actress posted a video online in which she sings the Ave Maria, an impressive cross around her neck. "To you, Notre Dame, beating heart of France", she said before the broadcast of an extract from the Ave Maria clip, which she had shot to illustrate her collaboration in 2013 with the group Era.<br>
<br>
"Ashes and desolation ... Our Lady. Yet forever the heart of all consolations ... Hail Mary full of grace ...", she writes in the messages that accompany this sequence a bit kitsch, which amuses a lot on the networks. ..</div></blockquote>

Orange is the color worn by Gitmo inmates.  Look at the photo of the Netflix series Orange is the new Black. The one white girl in the middle of everyone else whose black.  What's the message?  We're all prisoners now.. <br>
<br>
We're dealing with some very sick people. Orange represents transformation for the New Age cult.
</div></blockquote>

I &lt;3 U. You give the best explanations! This must be why I dislike that color so much.<br>
And yeah, it's all Barf inducing.</div>

If you can't get the links to post, you might try to archive them first.<br>
<a href="https://archive.is/" class="postlink">https://archive.is/</a> and/or <a href="https://archive.org/" class="postlink">https://archive.org/</a><br>
You can post your own photos and screencaps, if you want. There's no rule against it.</div>
