She said during that talk that the attendees would be given an 'action point' for when they leave the conference. Great. They can all go home confident in themselves that they are making huge strides in the trafficking issue. Except we know that they aren't.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...Over the next eight months, Detective Mike Fenton launched an investigation into what he believed was a large-scale prostitution ring engaged in human trafficking. Because one of the massage parlors, Orchids of Asia Day Spa, fell on the other side of the county line, in Palm Beach County, Fenton’s office notified Detective Andrew Sharp of the Jupiter police, who began his own investigation in October 2018...<br>
<br>
For seven days in early November 2018, Sharp and his team staked out the spa. Almost everyone they saw enter was a man. One day, a group of eight men who arrived in a golf cart made touchdown gestures before entering, their arms flung up to indicate that they were about to score. “At that point I understood this was not just a regular massage parlor but one that was an illicit massage business,” Sharp later testified...Sharp asked Herzog if she could survey the parlor, and on November 14, she complied.<br>
<br>
...Last January, he requested what is colloquially known as a sneak-and-peek search warrant.<br>
<br>
The warrant is a holdover from 9/11. Issued under the Patriot Act, it was initially designed to temporarily expand surveillance and investigative powers of law enforcement agencies in domestic terrorism cases. Since then, however, both the act and the warrant have been routinely used in cases that stray far from their original intent...<br>
<br>
Sharp received the warrant on January 15, and two days later his team returned to Orchids, where they evacuated the premises, telling workers that a bomb threat had been called in. While the women waited outside, officers placed hidden cameras in the ceilings of the massage rooms... Over the next five days, Sharp and his team watched, via a live feed, as more than 20 men received manual sex, oral sex, and anal play. When the johns left the spa, an officer would follow them and initiate a traffic stop as a pretext for identifying the men.<br>
<br>
..Among the patrons who turned up on the surveillance video at Orchids was Robert Kraft, the 78-year-old owner of the New England Patriots. Kraft, who visited the spa on the afternoon of January 19, spends part of the year in a double oceanfront apartment he owns on Breakers Row, among the most coveted addresses in Palm Beach. Earlier that day, according to a man I spoke with who asked to be identified only as Kraft’s “best guy friend,” Kraft had gone to the hotel spa for a massage. When he was unable to get an appointment, he conferred with his old friend Peter Bernon, the dairy and plastics tycoon who also lives in Palm Beach. Bernon offered to drive Kraft in his 2014 white Bentley to a place he knew in Jupiter, 20 miles up the Treasure Coast.<br>
<br>
As Kraft left the spa in the white Bentley, Officer Scott Kimbark, nicknamed Bark, stopped the car for a minor traffic violation. Kraft asked the officer if he was a Miami Dolphins fan and showed him his Super Bowl ring, explaining that he was the owner of the Patriots. Kimbark, having accomplished his mission, let Kraft and Bernon go with a warning...<br>
<br>
..Breakers Row—home to mostly Jewish residents, including Robert Kraft—is referred to by the island’s WASPs as the Gaza Strip. The clubs are so exclusive, local legend has it, that Burt Reynolds was once turned away at the door on account of his dark skin color. Even Joseph Kennedy Sr. was reportedly spurned on account of his Catholic faith. Besides, his money was deemed too new. “It’s new if it was made in the past century,” explained Debi Murray, chief curator of the Historical Society of Palm Beach County...<br>
<br>
The men who were arrested for availing themselves of Mandy’s services faced no such restrictions. After his arrest, Kraft was free to live his best life. He reportedly donated $100,000 at a charity dinner at the Breakers in Palm Beach, attended <span style="color:#FF0040">the annual pre-Oscar brunch at the Beverly Hills home of Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg</span>, and watched Rafael Nadal defeat Dominic Thiem in Paris to win the French Open...<br>
<br>
As the owner of a six-time Super Bowl championship team, Kraft understood that sometimes the best defense is a good offense. To represent him in court, he hired William Burck, who withheld sensitive documents from Congress during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing; Alex Spiro, who defended former Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez after he was charged with murder; and Jack ­Goldberger, the Palm Beach attorney who helped broker a plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 2017, Kraft joined President Trump and <span style="color:#FF0040">Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</span> at Mar-a-Lago (below)<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/7kh3f3.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

..The raids on Orchids and other massage parlors in South Florida were conducted in the name of rescuing women from sex trafficking. But the only people put in jail were the women themselves. A few, like Lulu and Mandy, managed to post bail and were placed under house arrest. But others were transferred to the custody of ICE...<br>
<br>
Within weeks of the raids, the state’s case had evaporated. There was no $20 million trafficking ring, no women tricked into sex slavery. The things the state had mistaken as markers for human trafficking—long working hours, shared eating and living arrangements, suspicion of outside authorities, ties to New York and China—were, in fact, common organizing principles of many Chinese immigrant communities. As an assistant state attorney in Palm Beach told the court on April 12: “There is no human trafficking that arises out of this investigation.”..</div></blockquote>

So, what was really going on? Vanity Fair says racism.. I'm thinking blackmail...</div>

			<div class="content">The Rothschilds Own John McCain <a href="https://archive.is/e1DxS" class="postlink">https://archive.is/e1DxS</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We have argued over the past few months that John McCain is still around dancing like a parrot because he has been paid to say weird things, crazy things, and dumb things in the media. He has accepted a large sum of money from terrorist states like Saudi Arabia, and the Guardian even reported back in 2008 that McCain’s funding came from a very interesting source: the Rothschilds. The report states:<br>
<br>
“A US campaign watchdog has accused presumptive Republican president nominee John McCain of violating election laws by accepting campaign contributions from two prominent Londoners.<br>
<br>
“At issue is a fundraising luncheon held in March at London’s Spencer House, during McCain’s swing through the United Kingdom. An invitation to the event lists Lord Rothschild and Nathaniel Rothschild as hosts, and indicates the event was made possible with their ‘kind permission.’”<br>
<br>
But what’s wrong with taking money from the Rothschilds? Well, plenty. Keep in mind that one of the “industrial forces” that controlled the financial world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries through covert operations was none other than the Rothschild family. The Independent itself reported in 2008 that the Rothschilds have dominated the political landscape through covert means for at least 200 years:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“The Rothschild family and politics have been intertwined for generations, ever since Nathan Rothschild, who founded the English branch of the family business, financed Britain’s war against Napoleon two centuries ago…<br>
<br>
“When another member of the clan, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, married the New York businesswoman Lynn Forester, they spent the night of their wedding dinner in the White House as guests of Bill Clinton. Lady Rothschild was a fund-raiser for the Democrats, but defected to the McCain camp after her friend Hillary Clinton was beaten to the nomination by Barack Obama.”</em><br>
<br>
The Rothschild’s dominance and power through covert means was even admitted by historian Gustavus Myers, who wrote in The History of the Great American Fortunes that “under the surface, the Rothschilds had a powerful influence in dictating American financial laws. The law records show that they were the power in the old Bank of the United States.”[2]<br>
<br>
S.C. Mooney writes that “the Rothschild family stands out in history as the prime example of manipulating the power of international banking… By means of usury on international scale, they were able to consolidate great wealth and power to turn world affairs according to their own fancy.”[3] The Rothschilds financed wars in England and America, collecting huge interest rates and making a massive profit...<br>
<br>
Jewish historian Esther Benbassa has similar views.[5] She states that “<span style="color:#FF0040">the Rothschilds were Scottish Rite Masons</span>,”... The Rothschilds, in relation with the Rockefeller Foundation, were behind the “fiat money and inflationist policy of the early New Deal.”[12] (In 2012, the Rothschilds again attempted to merge British and French banking operations in order to gain more control. David de Rothschild declared that the new system would “better meet the requirements of globalization in general and in our competitive environment in particular, while ensuring my family’s control over the long term.”...<br>
<br>
Carroll Quigley claimed that the Rothschilds, among other bankers, were secretly misleading governments and people; he says that <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Mirabaud</span> and the Rothschilds</span> became the dominant financial system between 1871 and 1900. British economist J. A. Hobson declared in 1902 that nothing could be pursued “by any European state…if the house of Rothschild…set their face against it.”...

Disagree on that.<br>
<br>
Basically what OP is doing is adding “marker lights” to bring up the really important points via highlighting.<br>

The green isn't so bad, however if I remember correctly, under the night view setting it's a pretty harsh neon  <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
