<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Back to Michael Capponi and his mother Danoushka Capponi. She works for his Global Empowerment Mission company. Guess who also works with them? Bethenny Frankel. ..So all these serious connections, the strange timeline, the sudden change in job industry,. And here's what gets me about these peoples biographies. Same goes for one of <span style="color:#FFFF40">Capponi's good friend Moishe Mana</span> who claims to have come from Israel to America and became a billionaire. It's always this bizarre rags to riches story with these people. Like its almost magical. 'Yeah I was drug addict homeless and then a couple of years later I was running nightclubs with A list celebrities' I don't buy it.<br>
<br>
..-Last night Global Empowerment Mission hosted a beautiful Christmas dinner at Hotel Florita. A treasured Unseco heritage landmark in Jacmel, Haiti built in 1888...<br>
<br>
One of Capponi's best friends is a guy called Moishe Mana. Moishe is big in the storage industry including storing fine art and wine. The Capponi family in Italy own a winery. We also know people who transport fine art can get around intrusive customs rules. Seems like a guy to know if you're into human trafficking and organ trafficking.
