			<div class="content">For those who are new here, Heather O'Rourke was a child actress in the 70's and 80's who met a tragic end at the age of 12. In 2017, a post by enty on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead.<br>

<br>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_%28season_10%29" class="postlink">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_(season_10)</a> It is very unlikely Scott Baio would be a reliable witness to this case. Wasn’t actually in any episodes of Happy Days with her.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/organizations/huffington-post-hp" class="postlink">https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/org ... on-post-hp</a> Seems Rob Reiner is a regular writer for the Huffington Post. So is David Geffen. No wonder the place attacks pedo hunters. <br>

<a href="https://m.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=133635867204812&amp;story_fbid=696941414207585" class="postlink">https://m.facebook.com/permalink.php?id ... 1414207585</a> Rob Reiner via his ties to Harvey Weinstein is indirectly connected to Jeffery Epstein. Allegedly met the Phoenix family in South America. It is possible all three of the siblings are victims.<br>

<br>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Phoenix" class="postlink">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Phoenix</a> Odd that Joaquin Phoenix would deny the Children of God rape allegations. Seems River and Heather once performed together in Surviving: A Family in Crisis. <br>

<br>
Timeline: <br>
-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Tobe Hooper (dead), Gary Sherman.<br>
Accomplices: Judy Wix<br>
<br>
-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).<br>
<br>
-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.<br>
<br>
Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. Heather’s family is threatened in 1989? The "skinning" was in 1991. Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. <br>
<br>
Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Bruce Kane (C), Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane, Lewis Arquette. (C) = confirmed.<br>
Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.<br>
<br>
-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result</div>

Or more simply Hollywood Jews raped her to death. Why on earth did you not include Spielberg as a prime suspect? Seeing as he, at the very least, is openly okay with pedophilia, hence why his self insert Indiana Jones was a pedophile. Also if I recall correctly that Issac Kappy guy who "killed himself" said Spielberg, among others, was a pedophile.<br>
Oh and since Spielberg spent a bunch of time with her and cast her poltergeist as he was looking for, in his words, "a beautiful four year old."

<br>
Simple. Enty specified three different incidents where the crimes happened. Poltergeist, Happy Days, and Rocky Road.<br>
<br>
Each incident having different suspects. Spielberg being the culprit of the Poltergeist incident.<br>
<br>
I do not think Spielberg was the culprit of the Rocky Road incident. He was especially active in 1986 as a producer, which means his work schedule may have made it unlikely he was at that studio on 11/7/1986. Its a matter of alibi.<br>
<br>
Believe me, Spielberg is involved in much more. Its an open secret in Hollywood that the “murder suicide” of Judith Barsi is a cover, and Spielberg was involved in her death.</div>

1. The CDAN link isn't working. I think it need a space between the link and the word 'The' from your following sentence. - <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-items-revealed-40.html?m=1" class="postlink">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/ ... 0.html?m=1</a> - <a href="https://archive.is/ozGlm" class="postlink">https://archive.is/ozGlm</a><br>
2. Part 33 is not labeled as such, and the SVF link doesn't work.<br>
3. Part 34 the SVF link doesn't work.<br>
You might want to check your other HO posts for the same errors in your copy/paste. <br>
Thank you.</div>
