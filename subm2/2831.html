They told us that they would do this back at the London 2012 Olympics.. that occult ritual.  As I've explained before this was the first time, at least at such a global spectacle, that a person with such gravitas took center stage with a fictional character.. James Bond.  Daniel Lewis appeared with the Queen, not as himself but as the character James Bond, thereby blurring the line between reality and fantasy. As someone who watches the media closely (and I've had some training), I knew then this was highly significant.  6:15 video *<em class="text-italics">cough</em>*

There's a lot of symbology in that video.  Examples: <em class="text-italics">the black gloves of the Queen.  The Ferris wheel. The people caught in one of it's bubbles, I mean the people waving from one of it's capsules. The Churchill statue. The dome of St Paul's cathedral.  The No. 1 Poultry building. At circa 3:30m the BBC commentator says "Well, they're heading <span style="color:#FF0040">East</span>" just as the helicopter flies through Tower Bridge under the Borromeo rings, I mean Olympic rings.</em><br>
<br>
Maybe I'll repeat what we've already written about the ferris wheel, the dome of St Paul's, the No. 1 Poultry building and the Borromeo rings in the comments below but for now I'll just look at the black gloves coz I've just looked that up.<br>

These six degrees are the culmination of the "Scottish" system. The first three are related to the <span style="color:#FF0040">Kadosh degree (Knight Kadosh)</span>, one of the fundamental Scottish degrees which served for a time as the highest degree of the canon preceding the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. In these degrees no aprons are used. The use of black gloves in the 29° and 30° contrasts with the white gloves used in the next three degrees. <span style="color:#FF0040">The black gloves are related, of course, to the theme of death and vengeance of the Kadosh.</span> The last three Scottish Rite Degrees are known as Administrative Degrees, although this is not entirely correct, since the 32°, Master (or Prince) of the Royal Secret, encompasses the entire Scottish Rite scale of degrees in a coherent and logical system. Again, in these degrees the apron is no longer used, perhaps to indicate that when reaching this level of development, the Mason no longer works physically, but only conceptually.</div></blockquote>

Knight Kadosh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Kadosh" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Kadosh</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Knight Kadosh is a Freemasonic degree or ceremony of initiation performed by certain branches of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry (or simply, "Scottish Rite"). It is the Thirtieth Degree of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite for the United States of America,[1] and the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry of Canada.[2] The Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite, does not confer a degree entitled "Knight Kadosh." Instead its thirtieth degree is entitled "Grand Inspector."<br>
<br>
The term "Kadosh" is derived from the Hebrew word "קדוש", which means holy or consecrated.[4] "Kadosh" and "Knight Kadosh" is often abbreviated in masonic documents as "K--H∴"[5] and "K∴K∴D∴H"..<br>
<br>
..In 1801, the first and oldest Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite was founded in Charleston, South Carolina. This body adopted many of the degrees of the Council of Emperors of the East and West, including that of "Knight Kadosh." The "Knight Kadosh" degree was adopted as the thirtieth degree and was simply titled "Knight Kadosh."[8][10] The degree received a substantial re-write in the 1850s when Albert Pike was Grand Commander of the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States. It was further revised in 2000..<br>
<br>
Controversy<br>
The Knight Kadosh degree is occasionally accused of being anti-Catholic. The 1918 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia stated that, in the ceremony in use in the Southern Jurisdiction of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in the United States, purported to have been written by Albert Pike, the Papal tiara is trampled during the initiation.[14] This allegation does not appear in any subsequent editions of the Catholic Encyclopedia,[15] although it was repeated by Father William Saunders in the Arlington Catholic Herald in 1996.<br>
<br>
Neither the Catholic Encyclopedia's nor Father Saunders' account agrees with Pike's earliest version of the ritual, which includes neither trampling or stabbing a skull and no mention of papal tiaras at all.[17] However, this earliest Pike revision of the Scottish Rite degree rituals, publicly available as "The Magnum Opus or Great Work," was not adopted by the Rite's Supreme Council for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States and thus was never practiced in that jurisdiction or any other Scottish Rite jurisdiction recognized by it. Whether these elements are included in the current official version of the ritual or in earlier official versions is not disclosed to non-members.<br>
<br>
Pike's book Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry does mention hostility to the papal tiara by the historical Knights Templar when discussing the Kadosh degree;[18] however, this is Pike's commentary on the degree and is not part of the degree itself.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Setting and plot<br>
An unknown, transdimensional force called Exotic Matter (XM) was discovered as a byproduct of the Higgs boson research (Large Hadron Collider) by a team of scientists at CERN in Switzerland.[8][9] This substance has been associated with the Shapers, a mysterious phenomenon or alien race.[10]<br>
<br>
Within the game, human reactions to this discovery fall into two factions known as the Enlightened and the Resistance. The Enlightened faction embrace the powers of XM to transcend mankind and believe their mission is to assist in the enlightenment of mankind by harnessing this energy. The Resistance faction see XM as a potential threat to humanity and believe their mission is to defend the human race by resisting the effects of those seeking to control others with XM...

<br>
In his first post-college role, he spent four years with the United States Foreign Service in Washington, DC and overseas in <span style="color:#FF0040">Myanmar</span> working on foreign policy issues...<br>
<br>
Hanke became the co-founder and CEO of geospatial data visualization firm Keyhole in 2001.[8] Early funding was provided by the corporate venture group within Sony, and the startup was able to garner significant attention from the use of their mapping technology in media reporting overlays during the early parts of the Iraq War.[4] Keyhole's mapping technology was also noted by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and Google acquired Keyhole in 2004 in a deal worth $35 million in stock...<br>
<br>
Hanke joined Google as a part of Keyhole's acquisition, and he became the Vice President of Product Management for Google Geo division.[3] During this period, he oversaw the transformation of Keyhole's technology into Google Earth and Google Maps in 2005. He also negotiated an agreement with Apple to include Google Maps on the iPhone.[9] Other significant products followed, including StreetView, SketchUp, and Panoramio. During this period, he shaped the team he would later use to found Niantic..

Reminder 1 - Knight Foundation was a key partner with Zuckerberg and CTCL to manipulate elections in the key swing states.<br>
<br>
Reminder 2 - Racine, Wisconsin was the model pivot district used to get the “Famous Wisconsin Five” districts on board with the election agenda as the model for the other states.<br>
<br>
Reminder 3 - The daughter of the founder of the Knight Foundation, James Knight, lives in Racine. Her name is Marjorie Crane.<br>
<br>
Reminder 4 - The Knight Foundation helped fund a corrupt alternative news media outlet in Racine called the Racine County Eye.<br>
<br>
Reminder 5 - NPR was also established in Racine. Why was Knight Foundation pushing to remove their public funding when they funded NPR multimedia training? How is Knight Foundation connected with other groups including  Brookings Institution? <br>
<br>
Reminder 6 - What are the “Knight Communities” and where did the Foundation move from and to?<br>
<br>
Reminder 7 - George Webb Sweigert is also from Akron, Ohio. What really happened to Jenny Moore and Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt after they met in Racine? Why would George claim to have met Jesus Christ in Racine with Jenny? Why does he continue to refer to her as his partner when only days before she was found dead she proclaimed that she “would never trust George again”?<br>
<br>
The Truth has been shared since The Beginning.</div>
