<br>
Well, as we know from the many posts on Voat, there are many overlaps between Crowley, the Theosophists, the Lucis Trust, the Bahai Faith, Luciferianism and Satanism..more of which I'll get to later..<br>
<br>
It's also referenced here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_symbols#The_Greatest_Name" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1 ... atest_Name</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The ringstone symbol was designed by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá,[17] and, as its name implies, is the most common symbol found on rings worn by Baháʼís, but it is also used on necklaces, book covers, and paintings. It consists of two stars (haykal) interspersed with a stylized Bahá..<br>
<br>
Baháʼí symbols are symbols that have been used, or are used, to express identification with the Baháʼí Faith. While the <span style="color:#FF0040">five-pointed star </span>is the symbol of the religion,[1] being used to represent the human body and Messengers of God, more common symbols include the nine-pointed star, the Greatest Name, and the Ringstone symbol, representing perfection, and the Messengers of God.</div></blockquote>

Directives from the Guardian <a href="https://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-141.html" class="postlink">https://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-141.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>141: NINE (Number)<br>
<br>
“The number nine, which in itself is the number of perfection, is considered by the Bahá’ís as sacred, because it is symbolic of the perfection of the Bahá’í Revelation which constitutes the ninth in the line of existing religions, the latest 52 and fullest Revelation which mankind has ever known. The eighth is the religion of the Báb and the remaining seven are: Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Islám, and the religion of the Sabaeans. These religions are not the only true religions that have appeared in the world but are the only ones still existing. There have always been Divine Prophets and Messengers, to many of whom the Qur’án refers. But the only ones existing are those mentioned above.”<br>
<br>
“The Guardian feels that with intellectuals and students of religion the question of exactly which are the nine existing religions is controversial, and it would be better to avoid it. He does not want the friends to be rigid in these matters, but use their judgment and tact, sometimes one statement is exactly the right thing for one type of mind and the wrong thing for another.<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">“Strictly speaking the 5-pointed star is the symbol of our Faith, as used by the Báb and explained by Him. But the Guardian does not feel it is wise or necessary to complicate our explanations of the Temple by adding this.”</span></div></blockquote>

Hmm ... interdasting... but let's leave that for now and I'll quickly reference here some other "guardians" without explaining why ... need to drop a few more posts before bringing it all together..<br>

Anyway, I got onto the Bahai symbols topic because of a video I watched on COVID data from India being misrepresented by the MSM to continue their fear porn.. I've recently done some posts on New Delhi and its connections to the Theosophical Society and the new world order.  I'd been meaning to do some more research on the famous Lotus Temple there, a Baháʼí House of Worship.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Temple" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Temple</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/q00u44.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>
The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides,[3] with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34 meters[3] and a capacity of 2,500 people...<br>
<br>
In 2006, some former employees of the Lotus Temple made a complaint to the police that the trustees of the temple had been involved in various crimes including spying, religious conversion and producing false passports. The trial judge directed the police to arrest nine specific trustees, but the Delhi High Court later stayed the arrests.
</div></blockquote>

This is where I seemingly get a bit random but stay with me.. I've always been struck by the architecture of that building and considering what's happening in the world at the moment.. the building reminds me of a closed corona or coronation crown... so I looked up the term 'lotus crown'.. google gives a lot of references to Smite and Smite Crown.. i.e. a video game... ever notice that the abundance of video games which incorporate the earth's history and legends, including references to magick almost drown out REAL history online?  I think that's deliberate.. they do that for a variety of reasons. One, to make information harder to find and/or corrupt it.  Two, to further blur the lines between reality and fantasy.  Remember how Elon Musk et al are now proposing that we actually live in a computer simulation?  Uhm, no we don't but the psychopaths are wetting themselves with the notion of actually making that happen.. Back to smite..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Smite is a free-to-play, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by <span style="color:#FFFF40">Hi-Rez Studios</span> for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One.[6] In Smite, players control a god, goddess, or other mythological figure, and take part in team-based combat, using their abilities and tactics against other player-controlled gods and non-player-controlled minions...<br>
<br>
Controversy<br>
In June 2012, some Hindu leaders became upset at the inclusion of several Hindu gods in Smite and the fact that they are player-controlled. The deities that were in question were Kali, Agni, and Vamana (the only playable Hindu deities at the time) and there was particular opposition to how Kali was dressed. Rajan Zed, the president of Universal Society of Hinduism, released a statement urging Hi-Rez to remove these gods from the game, claiming their presence is trivialized and in other words, offensive to the devoted. Since players control the gods, this is seen as offensive to the faithful.[46]<br>
<br>
In response Todd Harris, CEO of Hi-Rez, had this to say:[46]<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Smite includes deities inspired from a diverse and ever expanding set of pantheons including Greek, Chinese, Egyptian, and Norse. Hinduism, being one of the world's oldest, largest and most diverse traditions, also provides inspiration toward deities in our game. In fact, given Hinduism's concept of a single truth with multiple physical manifestations one could validly interpret ALL the gods within Smite to be Hindu. And all gods outside of Smite as well. Ponder that for a minute. Anyway, going forward Smite will include even more deities, not fewer.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>British Financier Sues Trustees of Orphanage He Funded for Alleged Embezzlement<br>
<br>
GANDARVAKOTTAI, India—After visiting India for decades, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, a member of the eponymous banking dynasty, tried to deepen his links with the country in 2004 by funding a new orphanage.<br>
<br>
The couple alleges, in a lawsuit filed in July 2011, that the Indian charity they gave money to run the orphanage—the Lady Lynn Joyful Home for Children—is mismanaging the home and embezzling funds. They seek the removal of the charity's head and its board. The charity's managing trustee, S. Pitchairaj, who also runs the orphanage, denies the allegations.<br>
<br>
The charity has filed its own lawsuit seeking an injunction against the Rothschilds from interfering with the orphanage. Both cases, in separate courts, have yet to be heard.<br>
<br>
Sir Evelyn says he is "disappointed with India" and his lesson is "you have to be very careful. You have to have people on the ground. The legal system needs to be looked at."</div></blockquote>

The man who was put in charge of building the orphanage, <span style="color:#FFFF40">S Pitchairaj, was running an NGO at the time called Integrated Rural Development Centre</span>.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>UN GATE, Oct 22 – How  has Antonio Guterres impacted the UN? While Guterres is missing for the sixth day without explanation, he has had as Executive Secretary of the UN Biodiversity Convention <span style="color:#FF0040">Cristiana Paşca-Palmer. Inner City Press has repeatedly exposed her, like Guterres, as corrupt.</span> Now Inner City Press hears that not Guterres, who should, but Pasca-Palmer is resigning, effective November 30, 2019.<br>
<br>
Consider this, exclusively published in August by then and still now banned Inner City Press: "Cristiana Pasca-Palmer is more corrupt and abusive than the man who was instrumental for her appointment  When Erik Solheim introduced Cristiana Pasca-Palmer as the new Executive Secretary of the CBD at the high-level segment of the 13th meeting of the Parties to the Convention (COP 13) in Cancun, Mexico, on  1 December 2016, he unwittingly admitted that her appointment was political, not merit based. He tied it to Guterres, before being fired for the same murky travel it appears Guterres himself engages in, even amid the UNRWA scandal.<br>
<br>
Now this, also exclusive: the dysfunctional Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD) in Montreal has reached new lows under its current boss, ASG Cristiana Pasca Palmer. Pasca Palmer who stands accused in many formal complaints submitted by the SCBD of racism against people of color, harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation, has struck a deal with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to recruit on her behalf a director for Director of Partnership and Business Engagement, Nature Action Agenda.<br>
<br>
As indicated in the JO, the position will be recruited by the Forum but the Director will be seconded to and report to the Executive Director of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity with a dotted line connection to the Head of Forum’s Biodiversity work. The proposed recruitment which clearly violates a number of UN rules and regulations prompted a sharp and quick response from the CBD alliance in an open letter, in which 22 signatories of the global network of civil society organizations with a common interest in the CBD expressed their dismay of the recruitment and demanded that this recruitment process be immediately halted until fully put into consideration by all Parties to the CBD.<br>
<br>
They also demanded the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to clarify that it is a multilateral organization of States Parties, and thus organizations which represent transnational business like WEF cannot be involved in employing staff ¨representing the interest of the Executive Secretariat and the Parties of the CBD. Meanwhile staff in UNEP tell Inner City Press about a damaging OIOS audit of poor human resources management and lack of trust between management and staff in the SCBD.<br>
<br>
...Three years into her term now, Ms. Pasca-Palmer proved her former benefactor's admission of the absence of merit in her appointment. When he recommended Ms. Pasca-Palmer for the job, Mr. Solheim himself was just few months old on his own post as the Executive Director of UNEP. He was forced out of his job on 22 November last year (in just a two-year time) after thorough investigation which confirmed his contempt to UN rules, abuse of authority and wastage of scarce budgetary resources on excessive travels.  Ms. Pasca-Palmer is a copycat of her former boss in her disregard to the UN rules and her addiction to travelling around the world. But she is worse in exercising her authority in abusive manner. ..

Love the work of Inner City Press.</div>

We know from our physiology that we have five senses — sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste — to experience the world. We also have five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot. Most mammals, amphibians, and reptiles also have five fingers or toes on each extremity.<br>
<br>
According to astronomy, <span style="color:#FF0040">there are five unique positions in space where a small mass can orbit in a constant pattern produced from the gravitational pull of two larger masses like the sun and the Earth. These five positions are called Lagrange points. There are five Lagrangian points for the sun-Earth system and five different Lagrangian points for the Earth-moon system.... The interaction of these forces creates a point of equilibrium where a spacecraft can remain.  </span>. For example, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Deep Space Climate Observatory are currently stationed at the first Lagrangian point, L1, between the Earth and the sun at about 1 million miles from the Earth. L2, which is 1 million miles from the Earth in the opposite direction of the Sun, is currently occupied by NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">The Symbolism of the Number 5 in the Baha’i Faith<br>
</span><br>
Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha’i Faith, wrote that this “5-pointed star is the symbol of our Faith, as used by the Báb and explained by Him.” Interestingly enough, the numerical value of the Bab is also five.<br>
<br>
In addition, in the late 1860s, Baha’u’llah wrote messages to five royal leaders — Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, Czar Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and Násiri’d-Dín Sháh – to declare that he was a Manifestation of God for this age. These messages were written in the form of a pentacle to symbolize the human temple. In this tablet, Baha’u’llah wrote:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Thus have We built the Temple with the hands of power and might, could ye but know it. This is the Temple promised unto you in the Book. Draw ye nigh unto it. This is that which profiteth you, could ye but comprehend it. Be fair, O peoples of the earth! Which is preferable, this, or a temple which is built of clay? Set your faces towards it. Thus have ye been commanded by God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</em></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SPACE RESEARCH UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINTSTRATION AND THE OFFICE<br>
OF NAVAL RESEARCH<br>
<br>
Our early satellite work was done under the auspices of the IGY /National Science Foundation program, the Office of Naval Research, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency,<span style="color:#FFFF40"> the Jet Propulsion Laboratory</span>, and the Air Force<br>
<br>
...The imaginative scheme of Robert Farquhar at the Goddard Space Flight Center for diverting ISEE-3 from its original station at the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Ll Lagrangian libration point</span> of the Earth-Sun system to an orbit enabling it to fly by Comet Giacobini-Zinner, the spacecraft being then renamed ICE (International Comet Explorer), resulted in the first in situ observation of dust and plasma physical phenomena associated with a comet (September 1 985)..<br>
<br>
..The emphasis at NASA in the early 1960s was on manned lunar flights. But the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and other groups had already made extensive general studies of the ballistics of flight to other planets especially <span style="color:#FFFF40">Venus and Mars</span>. The interest in Mars was driven by the desire for geological studies of its surface and, perhaps more importantly, by the desire to search for any form of biological activity there. Also, Mars and Venus were ballistically <span style="color:#FFFF40">much easier to reach than was Mercury</span> or the outer planets. <br>
<br>
In the late 1 9608 and early 1 970s a Grand Tour of the Outer Planets was being advocated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in particular, and by other planetary enthusiasts who were advising NASA on new programs. JPL had shown that the forthcoming configuration of the outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (a once-in-1 79-year phenomenon)<br>
would make it ballistically feasible to have a single spacecraft fly by all four of these remote planets. The Grand Tour, as such, was a budgetary casualty of late 1 970. Soon, thereafter, I was asked by JPL to chair a Science Working Group to develop a more modest-sounding mission, tentatively called MJS (Mariner/Jupiter Saturn). The two-spacecraft mission that we developed was eventually approved and came to life in 1974. It was later renamed Voyager. Although the term Grand Tour was now eschewed in polite conversation, it did not escape our attention that the configuration of the outer planets was independent of budgetary-political considerations in the White House and the Congress. <br>
<br>
...I have had no part in the execution of the Voyager program but have been a guilty bystander, so to speak, and one of its enthusiastic fans. In 1976-77, I chaired still another JPL/Ames Research Center science working group, called JOP/SWG [Jupiter Orbiter with (Atmospheric) Probe/Science Working Group]' Our purpose was to develop a follow-on Jupiter mission of more advanced capability than the Pioneers and the Voyagers. This program would have a deep atmospheric entry probe and an orbiter having a useful lifetime of at least two years, in contrast to the limited period (days to weeks) of nearby observation available on a flyby</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The first substantial hint that a tentacle of the Octopus had slithered into Mariposa County occurred on March 5, 1983 when a Mariposa County Sheriff’s vehicle scouting <span style="color:#FF0040">Queen Elizabeth II’s motorcade route rounded a curve in the Yosemite National Park foothills</span>, crossed a highway and collided head on with a Secret Service car, killing three Secret Service agents. CHP (California Highway Patrol) Assistant Chief Richard Hanna reported that the collision occurred at 10:50 a.m. between Coulterville and <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">La Grange</span></span> on Highway 132 about 25 minutes ahead of Queen Elizabeth’s motorcade. CHP Sergeant Bob Schilly reported that Mariposa County Sheriff’s Sergeant Roderick Sinclair, 43, was driving with his partner, Deputy Rod McKean, 51, when "for some reason, [he didn’t] know why," Sinclair crossed the center line and hit the second of the three Secret Service cars, which went tumbling down a 10foot embankment.<br>
<br>
The three Secret Service agents killed in the collision were identified as George P. LaBarge, 41, Donald Robinson, 38, and Donald A. Bejcek, 29. Sinclair, who had sustained broken ribs and a fractured knee, was first stabilized at Fremont Hospital in Mariposa, then transported several days later to Modesto Memorial Hospital.<br>
<br>
Years later, several nurses who had been present when Sinclair was brought into Fremont Hospital confided that Sinclair had been drugged on the day of "the Queen’s accident" as it became known in Mariposa. For months Sinclair had been receiving huge daily shots of Demerol, "enough to kill most men," according to one billing clerk. Some former deputies who had feared punitive measures if they spoke up, later corroborated the story of the nurses.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Assistant U.S. Attorney James White in Fresno ordered Dr. Arthur Dahlem’s files seized to prove Sinclair’s drug addiction. Sinclair’s Mariposa doctor and close friend had been prescribing heavy sedatives to him for years. When White attempted to prosecute Sinclair for criminal negligence, he was called into chambers during the federal probe and told by U.S. District Court Judge Robert E. Coyle to "drop the criminal investigation" because Sinclair’s drug problem was not relevant to the prosecution and the drug records could not be used in court. Judge Coyle’s reasoning was that no blood tests had been taken on Sinclair at the Fremont Hospital on the day of the accident, therefore no case could be made against him.<br>
<br>
In fact, the blood tests HAD been taken, but later disappeared. A significant piece of information relative to Judge Coyle’s background was passed to me during my investigation of the Queen’s accident by retired FBI agent Thomas Walsh. Allegedly, the Judge was once the attorney of record for Curry Company (owned by MCA Corporation) in Yosemite National Park. I later learned, in 1992, that <span style="color:#FF0040">Robert Booth Nichols had strong ties to MCA Corporation through Eugene Giaquinto, president of MCA Corporation Home Entertainment Division</span>. Giaquinto had been on the Board of Directors of Nichols’ corporation, MIL, Inc. (Meridian International Logistics, Inc.) and also held 10,000 shares of stock in the holding corporation. MIL, Inc. was later investigated by the Los Angeles FBI for allegedly passing classified secrets to overseas affiliates in Japan and Australia. It is interesting to note, though unrelated, that shortly afterward, the Japanese purchased MCA Corporation, one of the largest corporate purchases to take place in American history...</div></blockquote>

But there was a dark side to Wasserman - and to Reagan - all of which is revealed in a shocking new documentary, Wages of Spin II: Bring Down The Wall,  that, according to the film's producer and those interviewed, links both of them in darkly shadowed ways to the Mafia, and the killing of a U.S. Department of Justice organized crime Strike Force investigation into Mob influence and infiltration at the highest levels of MCA. It's a case that one participant in the film declares ‘dwarfs the Watergate scandal’.<br>
<br>
Neither Reagan nor Wasserman were ever prosecuted, let alone interrogated as a result of the events presented in the film because both were so well-insulated. <br>
<br>
Seven years before Wasserman’s death, President Clinton -- who like Reagan got a lot of campaign and financial support from Hollywood power brokers -- presented Wasserman with the nation's highest civilian honor in a ceremony at the White House, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.<br>
<br>
...The film's director, Shawn Swords, asserted to MailOnline that the Mob or MCA actually had a mole in the Justice Department. "It was somebody who was feeding information to the Mob and MCA. The FBI knew it was one of twelve people, but they couldn't finger the guilty one.'<br>
<br>
....A poor boy from a Russian immigrant family, Wasserman grew up in Cleveland, worked as a movie house usher at night, and after getting his high school diploma -- he never went to college -- joined up with what was known as the Mayfield Road Gang, an Italian-led Mafia organization with ties to the Jewish mob -- helping to run a casino.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS LONG HISTORY OF NOT FILING CHARGES ON THOSE WHO ARE ABOVE ALL LAWS<br>
<br>
The murder of Mariposa County Sheriff's deputy exposes a justice system fraught with corruption.<br>
FROM THE LAST CIRCLE BY CAROL MARSHALL - For the deputies of the Mariposa Sheriff's Department, the awakening occurred on June 24, 1980, when deputy Ron Van Meter drowned in an alleged boating accident on Lake McClure. The search party consisted mainly of three divers, deputies Dave Beavers, Rod Cusic and Gary Estep. Although adjacent counties offered additional divers, sheriff Paul Paige refused outside help, even a mini submarine offered by Beavers' associate.<br>
In the shallow, placid waters of Lake McClure, Van Meter's body was not recovered that week, and indeed would not be found until ten years later, in September, 1990 when his torso, wrapped in a fish net and weighted down by various objects, including a fire extinguisher, washed ashore a few hundred yards from where Sergeant Roderick Sinclair's houseboat had once been moored.<br>
<br>
Van Meter's widow, Leslie, had been at home baking cookies when she was notified of her husband's disappearance. She was an Indian girl who had no affinity with sheriff Paul Paige. The horror began for her that day also. Her home was ransacked and her husband's briefcase and diary were seized by the Mariposa Sheriff's department. Only she and a few deputies knew what Van Meter's diary contained. He'd told his wife he'd taken out a special life insurance policy two weeks before, but after the search that was missing also.<br>
<br>
Leslie was taken to a psychiatric clinic for evaluation shortly after the incident.The story surfaced years later, one tiny bubble at a time. The self involved little community of Mariposa did not cough up its secrets gladly. On March 23, 1984, Leslie Van Meter filed a Citizen's Complaint with the Mariposa County Sheriff's department alleging that the Sheriff's office had been negligent and unprofessional in their investigation of her husband's disappearance. His body had still not been found, despite private searches by Sergeant Beavers and other friends of the missing deputy. She wanted the case reopened.<br>
Paul Paige was no longer sheriff, but newly elected Sheriff Ken Mattheys responded by reopening the investigation. Investigator Raymond Jenkins, a Merced College Police Chief, and retired FBI agent Tom Walsh from Merced, were notified by Sheriff Mattheys in October, 1984 that the Van Meter case had been reopened and he wanted their help in cleaning up the Sheriff's Department.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Their investigation led them straight to the doorstep of MCA Corporation (Music Corporation of America), parent company to Curry Company</span>, the largest concessionaire in Yosemite National Park. A major drug network had surfaced in the park, compelling one park ranger, Paul Berkowitz, to go before the House Interior Subcommittee on National Parks and Recreation to testify about drug distribution by Curry Company officials.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Ed Hardy, the president of Curry Company, was closely associated with Mariposa County officials, in particular, Mariposa District Attorney Bruce Eckerson, County Assessor Steve Dunbar, and Congressman Tony Coelho, whose district encompassed Mariposa and the Park. </span>The annual camping trips that the three men took together was encouraged by the local townsfolk because most of Mariposa's tax base emanated from Curry Company. Coelho and Hardy were regular fixtures around town, seen at most of the social events. Coelho even cooked and served spaghetti dinners for the whole town annually at the Mariposa Fair Grounds, and purchased property in partnership with one member of the Mariposa Board of Supervisors. In fact, Mariposa was one of the first places he bid farewell to after resigning from Congress to avoid an investigation of his finances.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, investigator Raymond Jenkins had followed the drug trail from Yosemite back to the <span style="color:#FF0040">Mariposa airport, where sheriff's deputies were seen regularly loading and unloading packages from planes in the dead of night.</span><br>
<br>
One Indian girl complained bitterly about deputies <span style="color:#FFFF40">using the Sara Priest land allotment (reservation) to grow marijuana and operate methamphetamine labs.</span> Jenkins, by now retired from the position of Police Chief of Merced College, was called in to interview the Indian girl. That same day, as a favor, he provided me with copies of his notes. I followed up with a tape recorded interview at her home in Bear valley. Her father and uncle operated a small auto dismantling business on the reservation in Midpines, and after locating them and gaining their confidence, the uncle drove me out to Whiskey Flats, the site of the marijuana and methamphetamine lab operations. That week I rented a horse and rode down into the rocky, isolated valley of Whiskey Flats. Brush and shrubbery tore at the saddle on the horse and at the end of the dirt path I encountered three snarling Rottweiler dogs who put the horse into a frenzied lather.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I managed to photograph the irrigation system, artesian spring and pond from which the water was supplied as well as various points of identification for future reconnaissance. I later returned in a four wheel drive pickup truck and managed to view the trailer and lab shack.<br>
The tape recorded interview with the Indian girl, the photos and notes from my discovery were provided to the Stanislaus County Drug Task Force, but jurisdictionally, they couldn't enter Mariposa County without authority of the Mariposa Sheriff's department. It was a catch 22 situation. Ultimately I provided the same information anonymously to several related agencies. It was not until 1993 that the fields were eradicated, and 1994, before the labs were raided. However, no arrests of any deputies were ever forthcoming. <span style="color:#FFFF40">In fact, no arrests occurred at all, except for a few non English speaking Mexican nationals who had handled the "cooking." The head of the Los Angeles Drug Enforcement Agency noted to a local newspaper that the meth lab was part of a large California drug network, but they were unable to identify the kingpins.<br>
</span><br>
<br>
On July 6, 1985, Mrs. Van Meter filed a "Request for Official Inquiry" with the State of California Department of Boating and Waterways stating that no satisfactory investigation was ever conducted into the matter of her husband's disappearance.<br>
That same month, shortly after a meeting at Lake McClure with Mrs. Van Meter, Sheriff Mattheys mysteriously resigned from his position at the Mariposa Sheriff's Department. Mattheys revealed to reporter Anthony Pirushki that he had been ordered by two county supervisors and the county's attorney "to stay away from the Van Meter investigation." But that was not the reason he resigned. The whole story would not surface until seven years later when a reporter for the Mariposa Guide interviewed him.<br>
<br>
However, while still in office, Mattheys and his internal affairs investigators had learned the reason for Van Meter's disappearance. <span style="color:#FFFF40">A few weeks prior to his death in 1980, Van Meter had driven to the Attorney General's office in Sacramento and reported drug dealing and other types of corruption within the Mariposa Sheriff's Department.</span> This, according to his friends whom he had confided in, deputies Dave Beavers, a fifteen year veteran of the sheriff's department, and Rod Cusic, a seventeen year veteran. Both deputies were ultimately forced out of the department and retired on stress leave.<br>
<br>
On that same day, reserve deputy Lucky Jordan had driven to the Fresno office of the FBI to report similar information. According to Jordan, they had split up and reported to separate agencies in the event "something" happened to one of them.The crux of the story was State Attorney General Van De Kamp's response to the requested investigation by Ron Van Meter. When Ron returned home from Sacramento, he was confronted by Sheriff Paige. Paige had received a call from the Attorney General informing him of the visit and its contents, and the sheriff was livid about Van Meter's betrayal.Van Meter had been photographing and journalizing drug activity by deputies at Lake McClure. He was part of a California State Abatement Program which involved harvesting and eradicating marijuana fields in Yosemite National Park and adjacent counties. Instead, the harvested marijuana was being stored in abandoned cars and towed out of town by a local wrecker under contract with the sheriff's department. It was also being distributed at a hidden cove at Lake McClure.<br>
<br>
On June 24, 1980, frustrated and angry at the Attorney General for betraying him, Van Meter had borrowed a boat and was on his way to arrest the deputies at Lake McClure himself. He never returned. The investigation of Van Meter's "accident" was initially handled by Sergeant Roderick Sinclair, who could not have known on that fateful day that in exactly three years, three months, and nineteen days, he would enter the Twilight Zone where his own private hell awaited

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Though the Indian Government was always at pains to point out that the nine-day state visit of the Queen of England was no different from that of any other head of state, the elaborate arrangements and excessive detailing of the royal tour was undoubtedly meant to be the crowning glory of CHOGM... <br>
<br>
the Queen escorted in palanquin at St. Thomas' School; with Mrs Gandhi at Rashtrapati Bhavan and watching folk dancers in a village near Hyderabad..<br>
<br>
From the desperate last-minute efforts to put on the ritz at Rashtrapati Bhavan to the bitter squabble that broke out over the guest list for the governor's banquet in Hyderabad, the Queen's progress at times seemed like one more soap opera on the Raj being filmed by BBC television. Still, it remained a source of wonderment to most - and embarrassment to some - that a middle-aged, matronly-looking and thoroughly mundane woman who utters no more than basic exclamations ("how' d' do", "how kind", "oh, really") and makes the vaguest of speeches, should arouse so much public interest.<br>
Much spiel has already been delivered on the Queen's status as head of the Commonwealth, her sentimental association with India and the vast amount her Government spends yearly to keep the monopoly of her rule afloat. Not much has been said about the fact that she provides, at home and when travelling abroad, terrific entertainment.<br>
<br>
The lady reporters were craning their necks to breaking point to get details of the royal dress right. As guns boomed in salute and a wonderfully exotic-looking Indian chief of protocol (the combination of his brooding eyes, beard and sherwani were designed to shatter anyone at any distance) propelled her along the red carpet, speculation was rife among the press.<br>
<br>
"Strawberry," said a lady scribe, furiously taking down the colour scheme. "Coral, maybe," said a second, keen to put down any instant theory, while a third was making eager inquiries about the hat. A tall, white-haired English figure was seen rushing to the enclosure, having obtained the closest look during the ceremonial.<br>
<br>
"Tangerine," he gushed triumphantly, his moustache twitching in thrill, "it's tangerine with mauve and white flowers." The lady reporters were trembling. "The hat, the hat," cried the one with a fixed job of work.<br>
<br>
"What's it made of?" "Straw ect'ally," said the Englishman regaining his composure.<br>
<br>
"And the dress? What material?"<br>
<br>
"Crepe de chine, ect'ally."Presuming it to be the Queen's dresser, or lady-in-waiting perhaps since very often they look like men and have lately known to become lax in mode of dress, I asked: "Are you the Queen's designer?"<br>
<br>
"No, ect'ally. Just another reporter." He was, as I later found out, the Delhi-based correspondent of The Times of London informing the world that the Queen had landed in India. Next morning the Indian press had its say, when The Statesman announced her arrival with "Prince Philip erect as ever".<br>
<br>
....Details of the Queen's visit were being treated as state secrets. Partly this was for reasons of security. And partly because, the British monarch being a woman of many parts, anyone who comes close to a part likes to hold it close to his chest.<br>
<br>
At Rashtrapati Bhavan, a high-powered four-member committee of women was for six months closeted in refurbishing the suites for the royal party.<br>
<br>
The four - Mrs Gandhi's daughter-in-law, Sonia, her officer on special duty Usha Bhagat and Bhagat's sister Urmila Kapur joined by the wife of CHOGM chief coordinator Natwar Singh - had been instructed to keep their mouths shut and open them only to speak the Government line. Oh, nothing special for the Queen, they had been taught to say, the old place needed some doing up anyway.<br>
<br>
Lavish Setting: In the Dwarka Suite where the Queen was staying, new damask curtains had gone up and a magnificent Daniell print of the Taj Mahal, newly framed in mirrorwork, placed over the royal bed.<br>
<br>
In the neighbouring Nalanda Suite assigned to the Duke of Edinburgh and connected to the Dwarka by a set of double doors (they never share bedrooms, except as it turned out for their wedding anniversary in Hyderabad when news got out and the British press turned delirious with pleasure) everything was in colours of muted gold. Six other suites - the Godavri, Mysore.<br>
<br>
Tagore, Himalaya, Pepsu and Bombay - were given a face-lift to accommodate select members of the Queen's household such as her doctor and private secretary.<br>
<br>
At <span style="color:#FF0040">Hyderabad House, the mammoth sandstone mansion designed by Lutyen</span>s for the last Nizam near India Gate, the overhauling assumed epic proportions. For nearly a year, two professional designers, Rina Singh and Sunita Kohli, have been engaged in turning the place, as one Ministry of External Affairs official admitted "into the nation's premier guest-house". Anything special for the Queen? No, no. of course not....<br>
<br>
Special Arrangements: Luckily, at the British High Commission they were making no such claims. Everything was specially for the Queen, though they were letting out no details. After some trouble, they let out the names of the principal members of household accompanying the Queen.<br>
These included two ladies-in-waiting, her private secretary, her press secretary, her personal equerry and captain of her flight.<br>
<br>
In addition, the 30-odd members included unidentified dressers, valets, pages and footmen. "And of course", said Ronald Nash, the High Commission's new press secretary stiffly, "the high commissioner and wife count as members of Her Majesty's household during the course of the visit." He sounded like a man under great stress.<br>
<br>
After my third enquiry to ask if it were true (it was) that crockery and cutlery was being flown out from Buckingham Palace along with the cooks for the Queen's banquet, his voice became strangled on the phone.<br>
<br>
"See you at the press briefing," I said cheerfully to calm him down.<br>
<br>
"If I don't have a nervous breakdown by then," he replied.<br>
The idea of Nash's imminent collapse was confirmed later when, at the official briefing the Queen's Press Secretary Michael Shea (a man with grey hair, grey suit and steel grey voice) referred to him "as our nuts and bolts man in New Delhi".<br>
<br>
Behaving like a walking advertisement for the recently-formed RSPCJ (The Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty by Journalists), Shea, as the Queen's spokesman, over the years has mastered the art of talking a lot and saying nothing. Two of his favourite expressions are "can't say" and "don't know".<br>
<br>
In comparison, his Indian counterpart Salman Haider, joint secretary, external publicity division, is a quieter, younger, self-taught man who had recently taught himself to say to any assembly of journalists: "I won't waste your time with words.<br>
<br>
Next day, as the tour properly began with a visit to Raj Ghat, the British media in all its glory - some 40-strong men and women who had accompanied the Queen on her plane for the first time in the history of royal tours - were assembled bare-footed on three sides of Gandhi's samadhi.<br>
<br>
As expected, the Queen's dress came in for close scrutiny. "God, what's she wearing these days," said a disgusted Kathryn Adie, court correspondent of the BBC (whose radio and television networks alone had despatched 11 people to cover the visit) as the Queen walked by in a green print dress.<br>
<br>
"Not a hat," explained Adie politely for the benefit of her Indian colleagues wondering about the Queen's headgear. "It's called a toque."<br>
<br>
Later during the visit, while perambulating around the 17th century Qutb Shahi tombs outside Hyderabad, I pressed Adie about her growing disenchantment with the Queen's robes. "Well," she replied, "first of all a dreadful old poof called Hardy Amies dresses her...<br>
<br>
When the Queen's cavalcade in New Delhi coincided with the Ekatmata procession organised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Arnold's headline in the next morning's Sun ran: "Mystical men of the East wreck Queen's tour". In one of her few outbursts of fury at gross intrusions of her family's privacy the Queen once called them "scum".<br>
<br>
To which the acid rejoinder by The Observer's columnist Pendennis was: "Not scum, ma'am, but the creme de la scum."

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Calendar model Gail Thackray moved from Yorkshire to Hollywood after landing a part in Baywatch. There she branched out into adult magazines and made millions in the phone sex business..<br>
<br>
Despite her baby blue eyes, dimpled cheeks, blonde waves cascading halfway down her back and her pneumatic figure tipped into sleek black boots, Thackray prefers to think of herself as a Yorkshire lass who went to Hollywood and made good.<br>
<br>
Admittedly she was in business with the Mafia, pioneered internet porn, had her mother record phone sex messages, and made her fortune by amassing the world's biggest library of nude photos - but that's what makes her new tell-all book so entertaining.<br>
<br>
RUNNING With Wolves: A Woman's Memoir Of Sex, Scandal And Seduction sees Thackray lift the lid on the sexcesses of Hollywood and the steamier reaches of the worldwide web.<br>
<br>
"I must be doing something right, because I've had death threats, and six people suing to stop the book's publication so far," laughs a woman, who at 54 could still fill out the bikinis she once modelled in Britain for Tetley's Bitter and Vladivar vodka calendars.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/e5cbvx.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"> It's Hollywood stars who would rather see the book disappear.<br>
<br>
"When I was producing adult films I'd have Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss's boyfriend, actor Tom Sizemore, often come to the set to watch the filming, and he'd bring Jack Nicholson and Charlie Sheen and other stars...<br>
<br>
"Movie action hero Steven Seagal famously had bus-loads of girls shipped in to his film set every day to party with him - and girls were lining up for the chance.<br>
"I produced a sex tape with one Hollywood celebrity - I can't say who - at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood in the suite where John Belushi had died, but my star overdosed too and nearly died. I couldn't call an ambulance because he was on probation and supposed to be drug-free. Thankfully he pulled through."<br>
<br>
She adds: "There's a famous billionaire Hollywood mogul whose wife posed for sexy shots and recorded phone sex ads for me before they married. When the couple divorced his family tried to buy the photos to discredit her - but I wouldn't sell. I worked for Hugh Hefner's Playboy and for Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, and partied with both. I remember an orgy at the Playboy Mansion one night, with Hef naked in his room and 10 girls taking turns entertaining him. Crazy times!" <br>
<br>
..She branched out into publishing adult magazines and producing XX-rated films, so perhaps it is not surprising that Thackray attracted the interest of the Mafia.<br>
<br>
"Some New York investors came to me looking to expand their phone sex business, and I helped them negotiate ad space in adult magazines," she says, little knowing they were linked to the Gambino crime family.<br>
<br>
"I didn't realise they were mobsters. I grew their business, and found myself in charge of producing their phone sex taped messages and launching their business across Europe. The phone sex business proved a gold mine, earning over £40 million a month.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>MUMBAI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Saturday said she expected to finalise a defence agreement essential to allowing U.S. companies to sell sophisticated arms to India.<br>
<br>
“We are working very hard to finalise a number of agreements. I am optimistic that we will get such agreements resolved and announced,” Clinton told reporters in Mumbai in response to a question about an arms “end-user monitoring” pact.<br>
<br>
Under U.S. law, such a pact is necessary for U.S. firms to bid on India’s plan to buy 126 multi-role fighters, which would be one of the largest arms deals in the world and could be a boon to <span style="color:#FFFF40">Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.</span><br>
<br>
That deal is worth an estimated $10.4 billion, part of India’s $30 billion plan to modernise its military over the next five years.<br>
<br>
Lockheed and Boeing are competing with Russia’s MiG-35, France’s Dassault Rafale, Sweden’s Saab KAS-39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon, made by a consortium of British, German, Italian and Spanish firms, for the contract.<br>
 Clinton is also expected to work on finalising agreements around a civilian nuclear pact signed last year, and U.S. officials hope she will announce two sites where U.S. firms would have the exclusive right to build nuclear power plants.<br>
<br>
The State Department has estimated that could be worth up to $10 billion for U.S. companies. The two major U.S. nuclear reactor builders are General Electric Co. and Westinghouse Electric Co, a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>NEW DELHI — The President of India, Abdul Kalam, visited the Baha'i House of Worship in New Delhi on 18 March 2003, the first official visit there by an Indian Head of State since the Temple was opened in December 1986.<br>
<br>
Dr. Kalam was joined by Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani and Mrs. Advani, and Defence Minister George Fernandes....<br>
<br>
Dr. Kalam was also given information about the current discourse on science, religion and development being promoted by the Baha'i community. Activities have included a colloquium organized by the <span style="color:#FF0040">National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India and the Institute for Studies in Global Prosperity, a research organization that works in association with the Baha'i International Community.</span> (<a href="http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story/73" class="postlink">http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story/73</a>)

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>NEW DELHI — Noting the shortcoming of international development efforts to fully realize their goals of ending poverty and achieving social justice, speakers at a ground-breaking gathering of non-governmental, academic and religious organizations called for a new model of development that would emphasize spiritual and religious values as the missing ingredients in stimulating positive social change...<br>
<br>
Called the "Colloquium on Science, Religion and Development," the event was held 21-24 November 2000 at the India International Center, with opening day ceremonies at the Baha'i House of Worship.<br>
<br>
"Although there has been considerable evolution in development thinking over the past several decades, serious questions remain concerning present approaches and assumptions," said Bani Dugal Gujral of the Baha'i International Community's United Nations Office in an opening address on Tuesday. ..<br>
<br>
Co-sponsored by the <span style="color:#FF0040">United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)</span>, the International Development Research Centre of Canada, Decentralised Training for Urban Development Projects, the Department of Secondary Education and Higher Education of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the World Health Organization (WHO) and The Textile Association (India), the Colloquium was organized by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India and the Institute for Studies in Global Prosperity, an agency of the Baha'i International Community.<br>
<br>
Participants included representatives from a wide range of NGOs, academic institutions and religious groups involved in development work, mainly from India but also from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Colombia and Bolivia. The Colloquium also featured participation by representatives of the World Bank, UNICEF, WHO, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).<br>
<br>
"Development practitioners have for a long time been looking for a missing link, to explain the shortcomings of the current model," said Dr. Behnam Ta'i, the Regional Representative for South Asia of the Netherlands-based Institute for Housing and Urban Studies, who participated in the Colloquium. "For a long time, we thought it was the environment. Now there is a perception that spirituality is the link and the key idea for changing the attitudes for decision-making in the processes of development."<br>

...<span style="color:#FFFF40">Katherine Marshall of the World Bank</span> said religious organizations have long played a "special role" in both understanding and helping the poor. "Yet their insights and their work are too little known in many development circles," she said.<br>
<br>
Ms. Marshall, who oversees the Bank's recently launched collaboration with religious organizations, known as the World Faiths Development Dialogue, urged a new partnership between religious groups and development specialists. "The idea should be to engage in a process that opens new windows of understanding, raises the bar of objectives, offers new insights and new visions, on all sides," said Ms. Marshall in an address on Tuesday.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The year is 2004. The place is Phnom Penh.<br>
<br>
I am interviewing Somaly Mam, a famous anti-human trafficking advocate with a glittering catalogue of benefactors including Hillary Clinton, Angelina Jolie and Queen Sophia of Spain. The day before, Mam had led a rescue of 83 women and girls from an illegal brothel run by a high-ranking military figure – and took them to a women’s shelter. But the very next morning a group of heavily armed men raided the shelter, abducted the women and girls and took them back to the brothel....<br>
<br>
But I was not a veteran working for a global newspaper. I was a clueless rookie, a journalism cadet one year out of the University of Technology Sydney’s postgraduate school. Yet instead of following a regular career path – scoring an entry-level role with a suburban or rural newspaper and slowly working my way up to the top – I took a gambit and flew to Phnom Penh for an interview with Bernard Krisher, a former Newsweek Tokyo Bureau Chief turned publisher-philanthropist...<br>
<br>
In sync with its motto ‘All the News Without Fear or Favor,’ it exposed high-level corruption, crooked cops, illegal logging, extrajudicial killings, child-sex tourism, gang rape, land grabs, forced village evictions, border skirmishes, prison breaks, fake doctors, dodgy orphanages, human trafficking, drug-dealing monks, pedophilia rings, trigger-happy cops, and acid attacks by jilted lovers on a daily basis...<br>
<br>
Krisher burned hundreds of thousands of dollars keeping it afloat and used all of its advertising revenue to build schools and hospitals.<br>
<br>
And we all had the wool pulled over our eyes by anti-human trafficking advocate Somaly Mam. In 2014, she was exposed by Newsweek for lying about being a former child sex-worker and the rape of her own daughter in revenge for the brothel raid I helped legendary Cambodian journalist Saing Soenthrith break back in 2004...</div></blockquote>
