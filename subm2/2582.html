<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Central to the children’s testimony was the involvement of their father, actor Ricky Dearman, who has known connections to the self-professed spiritual leader, the ‘Supreme Master’, Ching Hai. The children go on to assert that they worship the ‘Supreme Master’. Notably, the Satanic Bible also states that ‘Satan’s ministers will obey all commands of the ‘Supreme Master‘. Objectively speaking, these claims cannot be overlooked, particularly since – in true Satanic style – keeping up a charade of decency and respectability is vital to abusers.<br>
..Ricky Dearman is involved in the film industry as an actor and has affiliations with ‘Supreme Master Television’, a television station airing from 14 satellite platforms and reaching hundreds of millions of households around the world. The beneficiary and focal point of this self-created spiritual hierarchy, Ching Hai is worshipped by followers the world over.

<br>
Furthermore, benefit concerts were held in Washington, DC and Los Angeles in Supreme Master Ching Hai’s honor. During these events, Supreme Master Ching Hai presented hundreds of thousands of dollars to US Veterans Affairs, Starlight Children’s Foundation and other American organizations.

The gifts, which were presented by government officials, were made on behalf of all the musical artists and to honor the organizations for their noble work.</div></blockquote>
