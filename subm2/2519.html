			<div class="content">I came by the website OUR WORLD because of <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Lawrence Bloom</span></span>.. he of the United Nations, Dakia Global/Universal Music Group and the <span style="color:#FF0040">Parvati Foundation.. all connected to the Bronfman family</span>.  <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#00FF40">See: Boris Johnson's father Stanley , Parvati Foundation and NXIVM's Rainbow Cultural Garden</span> <a href="https://searchvoat.co/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2258" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=2258</a></div></blockquote>

But <a href="https://www.lawrencebloom.com/" class="postlink"><span style="color:#00FF40">Lawrence Bloom</span></a>  needs his own post.. let's focus on <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#FFFF40">the Game</span></span> and let me show you how sinister this gets... you'll notice that the text from the website which I copy and paste has some spelling and grammar errors .. that's because the website's creator is autistic.. and that's part of the bigger picture which I'll get to in another post.<br>
<br>
OUR WORLD <a href="https://archive.is/ooAtj" class="postlink">https://archive.is/ooAtj</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Our Word partners with the Be Earth UN IGO (United Nations Intergovernmental Organisation)<br>
<br>
We have pleasure in announcing that we have now partnered with the United Nations! <br>
<br>
One of our contacts put us in touch with a new group of high profile talented people including Lawrence Bloom who is the Founder &amp; Secretary General of the Be Earth UN IGO (United Nations Intergovernmental Organisation)....<br>
<br>
......His passion is to support what is breaking through via what is breaking down in the current system. He considers this action will enable the emergence of a society whose understanding around the interconnectedness of all things will harmonise conscious economics, social wellbeing and environmental responsibility....<br>
<br>
They also have other high profile members including <span style="color:#FF0040">Chris Rockefeller Lindstrom who also serves on the David Rockefeller fund.</span><br>
<br>
Their website can be found below: <a href="http://beearthfoundation.org" class="postlink">http://beearthfoundation.org</a></div></blockquote>

That <span style="color:#FFFF40">Be EARTH</span> website now requires a password (which it didn't a few months ago <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":-)" title="Smile">).. we'll come to them a little later... the OUR WORLD website page continues:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Our World promotes the use of sustainable energy and educates people on the importance of moving away from fossil fuels and nuclear power and onto green alternative sources of energy. <span style="color:#FFFF40">We will be teaching the importance of respecting each other's human rights, of looking after each other and working together. We will be raising peoples consciousness and awareness of the importance of looking after the enviroment and the planet that sustains them.</span> We will show that if you prioritise the enviroment and peoples health then the economy will automatically thrive as we detail later in this post...<br>
<br>
..Our World and the satellite apps/games are only the beginning of what we have planned... The profits we make will be used to launch our NextGen Hardware division, where we will be building NextGen devices such as laptops, smartphones, consoles, etc which are not only less harmful than the current ones but will also heal people. The current devices emit harmful radiation such as EMF (Electro Magnetic Field). We are electromagnetic beings and their fields effect us even if you are not aware of it at the time. Science and more sensitive measuring equipment is now proving this.<br>
<br>
WI-FI and 4G also effect us, and the faster and more powerful they become the more damage they are causing us. We wonder why more and more people are being diagnosed with cancer, tumors and other health problems? This is one of the major contributors. <span style="color:#FFFF40">5G will be very dangerous to our health</span>, which is why it is important we get our healing devices out there ASAP...  As a bonus they will also never need to be charged....<br>
<br>
...This is why we say we are the next Apple, because we intend to build fully integrated software and hardware solutions, which will improve peoples physical, mental &amp; emotional health. We will talk more on this in a future post..<br>
<br>
Professor Klaus Bosselmann gave a very important speech at the UN General Assembly on Harmony with Nature at the UN HQ in New York on 21st April 2017 where he called for UN nation states to be <span style="color:#FFFF40">Earth Trustees</span>.</div></blockquote>

Here's a word from the game's founder David Ellams <a href="https://youtu.be/SB97mvzJiRg" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/SB97mvzJiRg</a>  I have no doubt he is sincere in his wish to create a better future for the planet.. it's the predators, I mean people, who surround and support <span style="text-decoration:underline">and guide</span> his work that we need to look at..<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2019/08/03/our-world-oasis-api-holonet-goes-open-source" class="postlink">https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single- ... pen-source</a> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We have pleasure in announcing that Our World/OASIS API/HoloNET have gone Open Source ...<br>
<br>
OASIS API - Where the central avatar/profile is stored and managed along with <span style="color:#FFFF40">the karma system that satellite apps/games can access.</span> It is also the universal API to connect everything to everything for the new new Web 3.0 (The Spatial Web). It will allow Blockchain (to begin with will support Ethereum with others to follow later), Holochain, IPFS, SOLID, ActivityPub, Fedaverse, Mastodon, Diaspora, WebFinger &amp; XMPP &amp; much more to all talk to each other! No more walled gardens or silos! Plus, what's more, it will allow <span style="color:#FFFF40">your profile/karma to be shared among them all including your karma</span>. This will allow many more OApps (OASIS Apps) to be written for many platforms/networks including existing legacy apps/games/websites. It will act as the bridge from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.</div></blockquote>

Karma system?  Satellites?<br>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#the-oasis-api---karma-system" class="postlink">https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Ou ... rma-system</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The OASIS API &amp; Karma System<br>
Our World is much more than just a free open world game where you can build and create anything you can imagine and at the same time be immersed in an epic storyline. it is an entirely new ecosystem/asset store/internet, it is the future way we will be interacting with each other and the world through the use of technology. Smaller satellite apps/game will plug into it and share your central profile/avatar where you gain karma for doing good deeds such as helping your local communities, etc and lose karma for being selfish and not helping others since it mirrors the real world where you have free will. The karma unlocks certain abilities, special powers &amp; items you can purchase in the game as well as quests and new areas to explore.</div></blockquote>

Yes, the continuation of the merging of fantasy with reality continues apace... the start of that was officially marked at the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony.. . but that's for another post and I digress..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Early on in the Pizzagate investigation, a group of researchers found that several new age centers in the United States and the Commonwealth were linked to Tavistock, a British program run out of London and which appears to also have its hand in the lives of several Comet Ping Pong members and Tony Podesta (see my Tavistock exposé here).<br>
<br>
More testimony:<br>
<br>
Spanning from Anon’s testimony and its ties to Harbin Hot Springs, we have uncovered a network of ritual abuse, child trafficking and evidence of Project MKULTRA taking place at institutions ranging from Harbin Hot Springs and Esalen Institute in CA through Ecstatic living, HAI Global and the Human Potential Movement through to The Haven in Canada,<span style="color:#FF0040"> Findhorn in Scotland</span> and more. These organizations are tied via the International Holistic Centers Gathering to the United Nations via the Findhorn Foundation, GEN, and Kitezh orphanage and Ecologia Youth Trust. They also share mutual ties and ancestry through the Psychosynthesis Institute, Teens &amp; Toddlers and ARK (a part of the Clinton Foundation) with Tavistock, the Huxleys and Military Intelligence in Britain and the US. Psychosynthesis’ founder then ties back through Alice Bailey to Lucis Trust and finally returns to the occult foundations of the UN.

Peace-Game</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We have pleasure to announce that Our World is the World Game that Buckminster Fuller envisioned many years ago in the 1960's.<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Fuller's Background</span><br>
<br>
Fuller was a legend, visionary and way ahead for his time, much like our very own founder and visionary David Ellams BSc(Hons). They appear to share a very similar vision of a World Peace Game, one which really will change the world...<br>
<br>
We really love his Dymaxion Map, which shows Spaceship Earth as one island in one ocean and is actually more accurate than the traditional maps we still use today, which appear to emphasise more of what divides us rather than what unites us as Fuller map does...<br>
<br>
Fuller also created many other amazing ground breaking inventions such as the Dymaxion House and Geosic Domes which were and still are a revolutionary house/dome made out of triangles formed in a sphere which proved to be much stronger that traditional rectangular houses. They were also much stronger, lighter and cheaper to make and used tension rather than compression as used in traditional housing. This is why they could withstand very harsh conditions and so were used extensively by the US military (they were also used elsewhere) and are still used in over 300,000 places, a common use was for radar domes....<br>
<br>
...<span style="color:#FFFF40">If we are honest we had not heard of Fuller's World Game until the latest BIG players joined our team who drew parallels to it.</span> Upon reading his vision we realized we had the same vision and goals, it would appear we had both tapped into the same "Source" of the vision.<br>
<br>
Oh, one of these BIG players is a small little organisation you may have heard of? The United Nations. We will share more on this in our next post... <img class="smilies" src="https://searchvoat.co/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";-)" title="Wink"> ...</div></blockquote>

<br>
The Charity Organization Societies were founded in England in 1869..The Scientific Charity Movement was a movement that arose in the early 1870s in the United States to stop poverty. It sought to move the role of supporting the impoverished away from government and religious organizations and into the hands of Charity Organization Societies (COS)...<span style="color:#FFFF40">However when it came to the COS's treatment of the "defective class" as they were labeled (insane, feeble-minded, blind, crippled, maimed, deaf and dumb, epileptic, criminal types, prostitutes, drug addicts, and alcoholics), the Scientific Charity Movement's other goals based in the popular post civil war social scientific theories of eugenics and social Darwinism came to light. ..Many of these "defective classes" were moved from the streets and into insane asylums where they were often experimented on by scientists of the time.</span><br>
