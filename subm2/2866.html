			<div class="content">I came to this post via the following document which has a lot of information which I can pull out.  I will focus on one tentacle (for now) :<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">The Great Reset: Identity and Principles of Occult Control. by Richard Cooper</span> <a href="https://jimdo-storage.global.ssl.fastly.net/file/be643b14-8001-4bf1-897f-a3d835d134a4/Who%20is%20Klaus%20Martin%20Schwab-3.pdf" class="postlink">https://jimdo-storage.global.ssl.fastly ... hwab-3.pdf</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>For those late to the game, so to speak, in 2020, we are dealing on the geopolitical stage, with far reaching<br>
aspects of political ideology and the mass control of thinking. First, let me establish therefore a caveat to this<br>
text. Either one gets this subject or one does not. For those that do not, theirs are the mainstream media, so to<br>
speak. There is no great mystery to the contradictions, surprises and ineptitudes of governments displayed<br>
throughout the year 2020, into 2021. The name of the ‘project’ for humanity is ‘The Great Reset’, to which<br>
‘Klaus Schwab’, founder of the World Economic Forum, mid-2020, wrote the key text. This analysis will not<br>
be a booster for the gravity of the situation we face, nor will it be a ‘vaccine’ for disturbing realities; rather, I<br>
write for those who still read and think. Besides it not being my intent to outline related matters only to an<br>
informed few; the subject at hand has implications for society, regardless of political allegiance; the careful<br>
reader will notice how we intentionally try to steer clear of the political pitfalls. ..<br>
<br>
...Around 1957 after attending Spohn Gymnasium in Germany, Schwab went back to Switzerland. From 1958<br>
to 1966, he worked for Escher-Wyss in Zurich, and was the assistant to the CEO “VDMA” (Association of<br>
mechanical and plant engineering) in Frankfurt. After this, he went to America for his Masters and met Henry<br>
Kissinger and Kenneth Galbraith. Back home, he received his Doctorate, form the University of Bern, and at<br>
the age of 30, he became member of the board of Escher-Wyss in Zurich, responsible for integrating EscherWyss into Sulzer AG. Notably, in Au, near Zurich (Switzerland) Klaus Schwab spent two years in primary school<br>
(1945 – 1947), <span style="color:#FF0040">site of Chateau Au, to which Klaus is inextricably linked</span>...
</div></blockquote>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Au" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Au</a> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Schloss Au, literally "Château Au", is a country estate located in Au, a locality of the municipality of Wädenswil in Switzerland. The spacious estate is situated on the Au Peninsula on Zürichsee lake shore in the Canton of Zurich...<br>
<br>
Also located on the Au Peninsula, is the Neolithic site named <span style="color:#FF0040">Wädenswil–Vorder Au</span> which is one of the numerous sites of Prehistoric pile dwellings around Zürichsee with numerous finds from the transitional period between the Pfyn and Horgen cultures, as well as relicts of the Bell Beaker culture.[3] The area of the settlement partially is located on the roughly 26 hectares (64 acres) large lands of the country estate.
</div></blockquote>

And because I know that there is a link between  Wädenswil, the British media and the Zurich hotel Dolder Grand, I looked it up: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolder_Grand" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolder_Grand</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Dolder Grand (formerly known as Grand Hotel Dolder) is a 5 star superior hotel in the Swiss city of Zürich. It is located on Adlisberg hill.. In 2001, <span style="color:#FF0040">Urs Schwarzenbach</span> became the majority shareholder, and in 2004 the hotel closed for an extensive renovation, reopening on 3 April 2008. The renovation and enlargement were led by <span style="color:#FF0040">Norman Foster</span> and cost SFr 440 million<br>
<br>
..On 29 March 2019, Dolder Hotel AG announced that Dolder Grand guests could pay their bills with Bitcoin as of 1 May 2019, making it the first Swiss luxury hotel to accept the cryptocurrency as payment. The payment solution is provided and operated by Bitcoin Suisse, which converts Bitcoin into Swiss francs, thereby eliminating any currency risk for the hotel.
</div></blockquote>

We already know about Norman Foster's connections to Switzerland, Israel, Marina Abramovic and the Rothschilds..<br>
<br>
Adlisberg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlisberg" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlisberg</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It is a picturesque location and the lower western side of the hill is now part of the residential district of Zürich. The Zürich Zoo and <span style="color:#FF0040">FIFA's headquarter</span>s are located to the northwest, on the plateau between Adlisberg and the Zürichberg respectively the latter one on the southern flank of the Zürichberg. It is also the location of restaurants, hotels, among them the high-levelled Grand Hotel Dolder.

Urs Schwarzenbach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urs_Schwarzenbach" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urs_Schwarzenbach</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Urs Ernst Schwarzenbach, CStJ (born 1948) is a UK-based Swiss financier...Schwarzenbach set up Interexchange, the largest foreign exchange dealership in Switzerland.[citation needed] Through its success, he has bought well over £300m of property in the UK, 123,000 acres (500 km2) in Australia, a palace in Morocco, £17m of assets in the aviation field and the Grand Hotel Dolder in Zürich.[3] He also has his own polo team, the Black Bears, which has some 600 horses, with 350 in Australia and 250 in the UK...<br>
<br>
He personally backed the racing-themed restaurant <span style="color:#FF0040">Café Grand Prix in Mayfair, London</span>, but this went into liquidation in 2004.<br>
<br>
..In 2007, Schwarzenbach outbid other foreign buyers to acquire Culham Court, a 650-acre (2.6 km2) riverside estate downstream of Henley-on-Thames on the Berkshire bank. Schwarzenbach bought the estate from Paddy and Annabel Nicoll for £35 million. Mrs Nicoll's father is Sir Martyn Arbib, former head of the Perpetual fund management company, who bought the estate as a wedding present for her in 1997 for £12 million.[4] Coincidentally, Culham's connections with the world of finance run deeper still; Arbib acquired the property from Felicity Behrens, wife of the banker Michael Behrens, who lived there for nearly half a century from 1949 to 1996..<br>
<br>
..In 2008, it was reported in the press that Schwarzenbach had bought nearby Fawley Court for £22 million. Another substantial riverside property on the outskirts of Henley-on-Thames and once owned in the nineteenth century by a Scottish banker, it was sold in controversial circumstances by the Congregation of Marian Fathers, a Polish religious community which had no further use for it. During 2012, extensive building works continue on the main house yet again with Symms continuing to be the main beneficiary of the contract and work at the two lodges adjacent to the A4130 at the main entrance to the "London drive" are being completed after well over a year and some interesting underground developments. In 2012 the Schwarzenbachs revoked their consent for the permissive footpath that had run alongside the Thames in front of Culham Court as part of The Thames Path for many years.<br>
<br>
Schwarzenbach has invested a large sum of money to underground the vast amount of the high and low voltage overhead electricity network with the boundaries of Culham estate..<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">VAT fraud and art trafficking with Galerie Gmurzynska</span><br>
In 2013/14, Schwarzenbach was investigated by the FCA (Federal Customs Administration) for alleged VAT fraud totalling some ten million Swiss francs and <span style="color:#FF0040">art trafficking</span>. ..On Tuesday 16 April 2013, <span style="color:#FF0040">Schwarzenbach's Hotel Dolder in Zurich, which had been displaying a lavish art collection, was raided by Swiss customs officials.</span> This action was simultaneous with a raid on nearby Galerie Gmurzynska on the suspicion of supplying the five-star Hotel Dolder with imported artworks valuing 75M Swiss Francs without paying duty..<br>
<br>
Schwarzenbach owns about 50,000 hectares of farmland in New South Wales, Australia, through his Romani Pastoral Company. Most of this is between Harden and Jugiong, and includes the polo estate Garangula, as well as Redbank, a house once owned by the impresario Robert Stigwood..<br>
<br>
He bought part of Palais Layadi, a 19th-century palace set in a 4,000 square meter compound in Marrakech, since at least 2008.The main parts of Palais Layadi (Palais Soleiman) which include the reception area still belong to the moroccan Segueni's family. ..Schwarzenbach has supported the internal and external refurbishment of the Venerable English College in Rome,[12] as well as its engagement of a research fellow and project archivist.</div></blockquote>

Ulrich Kohli is a lawyer and thriller writer... in the style of James Bond.. uh huh...<br>

Ulrich Kohli, lawyer for Dolder owner Schwarzenbach and thriller author, is on trial for tax evasion. <a href="https://nzzas.nzz.ch/schweiz/ulrich-kohli-schwarzenbachs-anwalt-sitzt-auf-der-anklagebank-ld.1590568" class="postlink">https://nzzas.nzz.ch/schweiz/ulrich-koh ... ld.1590568</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dec. 2020<br>
<br>
Ulrich Kohli knows how to put himself in the limelight with his second self, James Douglas. (Feldmeilen, September 12, 2014) <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/vn6vbo.jpeg" class="postlink">https://files.catbox.moe/vn6vbo.jpeg</a><br>
<br>
"Daring Game" is the name of a bestseller by James Douglas. The Zurich lawyer Ulrich Kohli has been writing wild thrillers under this pseudonym for years. Now the 78-year-old has to answer in a true crime thriller as a defendant. The District Court of Zurich will hear on December 8th as to whether Kohli is guilty of multiple willful evasion of VAT. The lawyer sees himself as a suspect in an unusual role. Like if he accidentally played in a James Douglas crime thriller.<br>
<br>
As the legal representative of the 72-year-old art collector Urs E. Schwarzenbach, who owns the Dolder luxury hotel in Zurich, Kohli is said to have installed offshore companies and constructed a system that circumvented VAT. A gallery owner on Zurich's Paradeplatz is also accused of helping out. The three men evaded over 11 million francs in import taxes by importing works of art worth around 100 million euros without taxes, the Federal Customs Administration holds against the accused.<br>
<br>
For this Schwarzenbach is to be punished with a fine of 7 million, Kohli would have to pay 2 million, the gallery owner 3.5 million. The presumption of innocence applies to the defendants. You deny the allegations, which is why the Zurich District Court now has to assess the decision of the customs administration. In the absence of Kohli and Schwarzenbach, who are being dispensed because of the corona pandemic.<br>
<br>
...The business lawyer usually loves to appear and knows how to stage himself. He posed for the gossip press with Colt, presented himself in his chalet in posh Gstaad and told journalists about encounters with <span style="color:#FF0040">Donald Trump and Michael Jackson.</span><br>
<br>
He once bought two apartments from the still-US president in his tower in New York, and gave the late pop star a present at a meeting in 2001: "I gave Michael a Swiss watch that unfortunately has expired," Kohli writes on his James Douglas website.<br>
<br>
....Kohli has been at Schwarzenbach's side for decades. The two met as young men in the Küsnacht shooting club in the canton of Zurich. They later met in the military.<br>
<br>
The lawyer kept looking for the company of celebrities, even in the provinces. In the summer of 2019, for example, at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of SVP Meilen, Kohli presented himself in photos next to politicians Thomas Matter and Christoph Mörgeli. Or he boasted in the media that he ran on the same SVP National Council list as Walter Frey in the 1990s.<br>
<br>
...Ulrich Kohli has also registered his second self, James Douglas, in the commercial register. He has already written a dozen books, three of the thrillers are also available in English.<br>
<br>
One of the titles is called «Firestorm». As a legal representative in the dock, Kohli sees himself exposed to a similarly threatening scenario; that a Swiss lawyer is threatened with a million dollar fine is probably a first.<br>
<br>
From the point of view of the customs administration, it is clear: Kohli had "played a central role" in the illegal tax evasion system.

			<div class="content"><span style="color:#00FF40">This is how billionaire Urs Schwarzenbach's lawyer ticks</span> <a href="https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/ich-stelle-mich-in-die-feuerlinie/story/12724505" class="postlink">https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/st ... y/12724505</a><br>
<br>
Ulrich Kohli and Donald Trump climbed a long flight of stairs to view a secret antenna on the roof level of the 55-story skyscraper. The Swiss lawyer bought two apartments in Manhattan from the real estate mogul - first one in Trump Parc on Central Park in 1988 and later one in Trump Palace on 69th Street. Now he found himself at 190 meters above ground, several floors above his apartment. And inspected equipment that the Secret Service apparently used with the current US President.<br>
<br>
Ulrich Kohli loves such stories. Celebrities, secret service, the technology of tomorrow - and he is right in the middle.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of this week the lawyer received the “Tages-Anzeiger” in his office. As a representative of the billionaire Urs Schwarzenbach, he himself has become a public figure. Kohli's equipment at the meeting: Macbook, iPad, iPhone, large screen - and over a dozen pages of printed notes, some of which he dictated into the reporter's recording device in written German.<br>
<br>
The advocate is careful. Subsequent taxes of over 100 million francs and fines of millions are in the room. Schwarzenbach is at odds with the customs and tax authorities because of his art activities; they accuse the owner of the Hotel Dolder of incorrectly taxing art treasures and importing them unpaid.<br>
<br>
Video - The police confiscated around 30 works of art from Urs Schwarzenbach's Dolder luxury hotel...<br>
<br>
The offshore architect<br>
At least the business relationship cannot be too distant. According to research by the TA, Kohli looks after companies in Switzerland, England, Panama and Liberia that are part of Schwarzenbach's universe - some for more than twenty years. He is a specialist for offshore companies, which is why he has been in the focus of the media several times. Nothing got stuck. "I've never been charged, not even in traffic, so it was a fine," he says. His law firm was screened twice last year by the self-regulatory organization of the bar association. And got top marks twice...<br>
<br>
On that day, Kohli also took on the role of speaker. It was he who contacted the press and denounced the "raid" by customs. So he is, always on the side of the weaker and the attacked. “If you have prominent clients, then you come into focus as a lawyer. Then I'll just stand in the line of fire, like the President's Secret Service. "<br>
<br>
Such US comparisons keep coming up with Kohli. He has admired the United States since he traveled to New York in the 1970s as chief counsel for Bank Julius Baer. <span style="color:#FF0040">“There is enormous drama there that is missing in Europe. You have the race issue. The death penalty. Organized crime. The Mafia. And then the 19 Washington secret services. That's where I learned to write thrillers. "</span>...<br>
<br>
Kohli's fascination with guns and crime goes way back. <span style="color:#FF0040">He grew up at Schwarzenburg Castle in the canton of Bern, his father served as court president and governor, and the property also included the remand prison.</span> The boy rummaged through police files, heard a prison breakout, and set up a shooting range in the attic. The first stories were written on the official typewriter, he says.<br>
<br>
In 1979 he started his own business. He later gave up a career in the Zurich SVP and a judge's office at the administrative court in order to be able to write more. According to his own statements, he sold over 100,000 books, which is unusual for a Swiss author. The features cut him, however, like many thriller writers. There are only a few Douglas reviews in established newspapers. In the NZZ it is Lieutenant Colonel Kohli who supports the army in guest articles. James Douglas? Banished in the footnotes of the articles.<br>
<br>
The Sean Connery era<br>
The alter ego, made up of “James Bond” and “Michael Douglas”, has long since grown together with Kohli. At the entrance to the law firm, there is a second plaque under the sign “Kohli &amp; Partner Rechtsanwälte”: “James Douglas Operations”. And sometimes the levels mix - in the Schwarzenbach case, Douglas appeared as the exclusive interviewer who visited the billionaire at his property in Marrakech. The finance portal “Finews.ch” published the interview - without realizing that Kohli had a mandate for Schwarzenbach, as the NZZ first reported...<br>
<br>
In the meantime he has started to reduce his mandates for reasons of age. But the accusation that he is old school hits the 74-year-old: “That’s wrong in both directions. I am a visionary, I see something coming before others notice it. " Domiciliary companies in Panama are over, today companies are being founded in the USA. Confronted with a number of Panama companies in which Kohli is still active, he speaks of "old stocks" that he still looks after. These are mandates from non-EU nationals who have no “tax exposure” in Europe, i.e. no tax problems.<br>
<br>
The client thing is tricky for Kohli. He would like to talk, tell stories. Yes, billionaire Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan of the small state of Brunei, is his client. What exactly is he doing for him? Legal confidentiality. Connections between Schwarzenbach and the Sultan? Legal confidentiality. Details about the client Uri Geller, the «spoon bender» and illusionist? Legal confidentiality.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">With Obama at the Harvard Club</span><br>
<br>
It is easier with acquaintances who are not his clients. With Donald Trump, for example, whom he met at the Christmas party of the Trump apartment owners, or on the roof of Trump Palace. Kohli says: The mysterious antenna ensured the communication of the US presidents whenever they were in New York - "who would have thought at the time that this antenna would one day serve for Mr. Trump's own protection?"<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">He also met Barack Obama in New York's Harvard Club. And he had letters of thanks from George W. Bush. As a donor, he was accepted into an «Inner Circle».</span></span> These stories - are the levels mixed up again here?<br>
<br>
No, the antenna exists. The US portal “Buzzfeed” revealed that Trump has received around 150,000 dollars from the Secret Service since 2011. Two campaign donations from Kohli can also be found. An official US donation database shows transfers totaling $ 1,300. Mail to Kohli: Is that so? "Thanks for the info, it'll be true," he emails back. "Greetings, Kohli."</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="color:#00FF40">2013 Hotel Dolder VAT evasion and gallery raid by Swiss Customs - Galerie Gmurzynska </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galerie_Gmurzynska" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galerie_Gmurzynska</a><br>
<br>
Galerie Gmurzynska is a commercial art gallery based in Zurich, Switzerland, specializing in modern and contemporary art and work by the Russian avant-garde. It became a popular venue for international collectors seeking Russian art that was banned by the Soviet regime, and, according to Artnet, became the "go-to place for Russian art for international collectors"..<br>
<br>
The gallery buys and sells mostly works by modern and contemporary artists. It also sells pieces at art fairs by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Kurt Schwitters, Fernand Leger, Lyonel Feininger, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Stallone and Fernando Botero. The gallery works with the estates of Yves Klein, Wifredo Lam, Louise Nevelson, and Robert Indiana among others. It also arranged for an exhibition of Sylvester Stallone at the Museum of Modern Art in Nice in 2015[2] and hosts the artwork of fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld and the architect Richard Meier...<br>
<br>
The gallery was founded in 1965 in Cologne, Germany, by Antonina Gmurzynska, a Polish immigrant who worked in a museum before her move.[1] It held an exhibition of Japanese art in its first year. The following year, the gallery presented the work of David Burliuk. Until 1971, the gallery's program focused on the Russian avant-garde.[1] Gallery founder Antonina Gmurzynska developed contacts with the artists' families, and allegedly helped to smuggle artwork that was banned by the Soviet regime out of Russia.[4]<br>
<br>
In 1986, Antonina's daughter Krystina took over the business upon her mother's death, together with her business partner (sometimes called the "co-owner") Mathias Rastorfer. Gmurzynska's daughter, Isabelle Bscher, is also involved with the gallery for promotional purposes...<br>
<br>
In 2005, the gallery relocated from Cologne to Switzerland and opened a gallery on Zürich's Paradeplatz. The gallery arranged with the building's owner to restore the facade, built in 1880, to its original style with large windows. The windows are glazed with armoured glass.[9] <span style="color:#FF0040">That same year, the gallery participated in the Art Basel Miami Beach</span>, during which its Yves Klein fire drawing from its Cologne gallery was valued at $1.6 million...<br>
<br>
In 2010, the gallery held an exhibition entitled <span style="color:#FF0040">Zaha Hadid and Suprematism</span>, which was designed and curated by Hadid and Patrik Schumacher. The installation was designed to be viewed through the gallery's window on Paradeplatz.[11] Works displayed at the exhibition included Kazimir Malevich's Red Square: Painterly Realism of a Peasant Woman in Two Dimension, as well as paintings by Ilya Chashnik and Alexander Rodchenko. The exhibit placed the influence of the Russian artists with Hadid's work. It was the first exhibition to connect Hadid with Suprematism art, according to Wallpaper*..<br>
<br>
At the 2014 Art Basel in Miami Beach, to celebrate their 50th anniversary, the gallery's booth was designed by film director Baz Luhrmann, costume designer Catherine Martin and music producer Nellee Hooper. The exhibition was titled A Kid Could Do That! It featured works by twentieth-century artists such as Joan Miró, Kazimir Malevich, Wilfredo Lam, Cy Twombly and Fancis Bacon..<br>
<br>
Controversies<br>
1993 smuggling of Nikolai Khardzhiev collection<br>
The Galerie was involved in moving a major collection of documents, drawings and paintings by Russian Futurist artists estimated at around £100 million, belonging to Nikolai Khardzhiev and his wife Lidia Chaga, from Moscow to Amsterdam.[22] In 1993, Krystyna Gmurzynska and Mathias Rastorfer visited the Khardzhievs in Moscow, and signed agreements described by Rastorfer as “letters of intent” over $2.5 million in exchange for six works of Malevich art worth $30 million.[22] The gallery arranged the packing and removal of the artworks, but then left the Khadzhievs in Amsterdam and cut off communications with them while retaining control of their collections.[23] As reported in articles published in The New York Times and the New Left Review, the Khardzhievs were duped.[24][23]<br>
<br>
Edelman v Gmurzynska insurance dispute<br>
Between 2007 and 2009, Gmurzynska and Rsatorfer were involved in a further dispute. Dealer Asher B. Edelman loaned a work to Gmurzynska that was returned damaged.[25] Gmurzynska and Rastorfer ignored the claim.[25] In 2009, a U.S. district court judge awarded Edelman a default judgment of $765,000 to which Gmurzynska and Rastorfer failed to respond, leading four of the Gmurzynska's paintings to be seized at the Miami Beach Art Fair and held for two days until the gallery paid the judgment.[25][26] Edelman was awarded an additional $250,000 for what the judge described as the gallery's "wilful conduct" in the matter, i.e. their failure to respond to the lawsuit. Gmurzynska and Rastorfer disputed any wrongdoing, stating that "The gallery never received any notice that Mr. Edelman had applied for a default judgment".[27]<br>
<br>
2013 Hotel Dolder VAT evasion and gallery raid by Swiss Customs<br>
In 2013, the gallery was raided by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration regarding VAT on imported artworks worth 85M Swiss Francs supplied by the Gmurzynska gallery to the Dolder Grand Hotel, owned by Urs Schwarzenbach. Documents and computers were seized as evidence while the Hotel Dolder was subject to a simultaneous raid. Gmurzynska filed a complaint in order to prevent their inspection, but the Federal Court has ruled that in a criminal investigation of this kind where there is reasonable suspicion, the prosecuting FCA can demand to see papers it considers relevant to the case. The evidence made available to journalists indicates that a sham company issuing fake bills was used to import the works via a bonded warehouse, enabling Schwarzenbach to avoid paying the required import duty.[28] The case was reported in Zurich's leading newspaper, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung.[29]<br>
<br>
2018 hiring of Benjamin Genocchio<br>
In 2018, Gmurzynska Gallery drew attention when Benjamin Genocchio became a partner, serving as vice president at the Gallery's New York branch. Genocchio was previously replaced as director of the Armory Show after multiple complaints of sexual harassment.</div>

Mr. Pippin composed the opening song, “Never Set Foot,” as well as <span style="color:#FF0040">the song for the Italy scene, titled “Initiation,”</span> both with lyrics based on Supreme Master’s poems from her brilliant collection, Silent Tears.<br>
<br>
“This time I did the opening number, which was really marvelous,” he shared. “And I must say that the arrangement and the way it was done was so thrilling, to see it work. Last year I wrote the opening number. So I seem to have become the opening number writer. But the thing I really loved writing was the Italian number for Mark Janicello. He’s brilliant. I went on YouTube and I saw many of his things and heard him sing. So I felt I really knew his voice. So it was wonderful to write for that voice.” <br>
<br>
Acclaimed Italian tenor and principal cast member Mark Janicello expressed his admiration and appreciation of Mr. Pippin on several occasions, saying that Mr. Pippin’s composition fit his voice “like a glove.” Mr. Janicello expressed, “I’ve got four-and-a-half octaves, and I sing everything from pop to Elvis to Lady Gaga. And he [Don Pippin] just duplicated what I can do and how I communicate, and he put all of it into this amazing song. The song was written to my voice, it’s beautiful. It does everything that I do best. And I can only say, Don, thank you so much.”<br>
<br>
During his creative process of composing for Loving the Silent Tears, composer Don Pippin wrote down his impressions of Supreme Master Ching Hai’s poetry. The following are excerpts:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">When the worldly people get married<br>
Their passion will somewhat cool down.<br>
But when I’m betrothed to You,<br>
My passion only begins to glow!</em><br>
<br>
“The thing amazing about her poems,” said the distinguished composer, “[is] you cannot just read through it once and say, ‘Oh, well, that’s nice,’ or ‘that’s this.’ You have to really read them different times, when you’re in a different mood, because you’ll get a different feeling about it each time. The opening number particularly, her humor is so strong in that. And then she can become so deep in her thought process. The lady is fantastic.”<br>

BARONESS FANNY MOSER AND SIGMUND FREUD<br>
Source: Yearbook of the City of Wädenswil 2002 Gaby Schneider<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>On the Hinteren Au, General Johann Rudolf Werdmüller had a country house built in the Venetian style in 1650/51: Au Castle. After several changes of hands, it came into the possession of Fanny Moser-Sulzer in 1887 , who resided here splendidly and ran a large house. In 1917, Hans von Schulthess-Bodmer became the new owner of the property. He had the country house demolished and replaced in 1928/29 by today's Au Castle, which has belonged to the Canton of Zurich since 1989.<br>
Summer 1890. A traveler from Vienna hands over his luggage to the coachman at the Au train station. The slim bearded gentleman is Doctor Sigmund Freud. The trip goes to Au Castle, the current residence of Baroness Moser-Sulzer. A romantic pond and well-tended gardens surround the stately building. The Baro<br>
<br>
THE DAUGHTER WANTS TO STUDY<br>
In 1890 Mentona , the younger daughter of the baroness, was 15 years old. A year earlier, the older sister Fanny was placed in a boarding school for girls. “When she got home she looked very adult, and there were violent scenes between her and her mother,” recalls Mentona. In her need, the mother wrote to Doctor Freud and asked him to come. On Freud's advice, the mother granted the older daughter's ardent wish: she was allowed to study. As progressive as he was towards his mother, in his studies he paints a picture of his daughter that is not flattering. Freud observed in her a pathological disposition and similar hysterical states as in her mother.<br>
The landlady Fanny Moser (1848–1925), a woman of almost 40 at the time, had already experienced a lot. At the age of 21, she married a man 43 years her senior, the Schaffhausen industrialist Heinrich Moser, who had made his fortune with watches in Russia. This against the will of their parents, even the children from Heinrich Moser's first marriage are not very happy about the remarriage.<br>
In 1872 the first daughter Fanny is born. Heinrich Moser died on October 23, 1874, just three days after the birth of their second daughter Mentona. We know from Mentona how she went to and fro in the Au Castle in her wife's time. In her memoirs "I lived" she describes her mother as a capricious woman who always appeared as a lady of the world. She was able to do this thanks in part to the considerable fortune that she had inherited from her husband. The list of guests who came and went here is impressive: the families of Salis, Escher, Wille, the poets Conrad Ferdinand Meyer or Meinrad Lienert, Albert Heim, geologist, Marie Heim-Vögtlin, Switzerland's first practicing doctor , the scholar Auguste Forel and the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler.<br>
ness Fanny Moser-Sulzer welcomes her guest, whom she already knows from a stay in a sanatorium in Vienna. He should bring peace back to the widow's family and calm the broken nerves of the landlady.<br>
<br>
GREAT ASSETS<br>
Fanny Moser, née Freiin Sulzer-von Wart, was spoken to as Baroness. However, she was not accepted into aristocratic circles because the persistent rumor persisted that she had poisoned her husband, even if the husband's body was exhumed and no poison could be detected. Fanny Moser Sulzer didn't really want to get married again, because she didn't want to be married because of her fortune.<br>
The celibacy does not seem to have easily passed her by. Freud realized this:<br>
“When, as I mentioned, I spent a few days as a guest in your country house, a stranger was present at one meal and he evidently tried to be pleasant. After he left, she asked me how I had liked him and added casually: "You can imagine, the man wants to marry me." Freud suspected that she longed for a new marriage, "but found in the existence of the two daughters the obstacle to the realization of her intention".<br>
<br>
ROLE OF THE BENEFICIARY<br>
Daughter Mentona viewed her mother critically and was annoyed when the rich woman played the benefactress in front of poor people. In this difficult mother-daughter relationship, Mentona was not at all unhappy when Madame Moser went to a sanatorium in Vienna in the spring of 1889. In the meantime, children, educators and maids lived in a guesthouse and visited their mothers. Once, Dr. Freud into the room: Mentona remembers: “He was small and thin, had blue-black hair and large dark eyes. He looked almost shy and very young, but made a deep impression on me. "<br>
Freud describes the treatment of Fanny alias Emmy von N. in the work “Studies on Hysteria”, which he wrote together with his friend and colleague Josef Breuer. He writes: «On May 1st, 1889, I became the doctor of a 40-year-old lady whose ailments and personality aroused so much interest in me that I devoted a large part of my time to her. She was hysterical, easily put into somnambulism, and when I noticed this, I decided to use Breuer's method of hypnosis on her. What she speaks is entirely coherent and evidently shows an unusual education and intelligence....
