<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The reality of protected child abuse and snuff networks... <br>
<br>
One of the more interesting cases pertaining to snuff movies is a child abuse and -trafficking ring of Brits who were forced to relocate to the Amsterdam region in the 1980s. Over the years, this ring made the news on several occasions.<br>
<br>
The first time was in 1990, when a teenage victim-witness, Andrew, contacted welfare workers of the <span style="color:#FFFF00">British National Association for Young People In Care (NAYPIC)</span>. Andrew claimed to have been a victim of a British pedophile ring and forced on several occasions to film snuff movies in a warehouse in or around Amsterdam. The welfare workers were skeptical, but until further developments the teenager was allowed to live in the home of NAYPIC's London development officer, Mary Moss. Just before Andrew was to give a more official testimony, he was drugged and pulled into a van, right in front of Moss' home. The teenager had already been threatened and followed in the streets before this kidnapping. It's not known if he was never heard of again. <br>
<br>
"Welfare staff at Naypic have been convinced by Andrew and other runaways that such [snuff] films are being made. They have been told of a paedophile group known as the Elite Twelve, which is prepared to pay up to Pounds 5,000 to youngsters to make videos involving torture and sado-masochism, and which may lead to murder.".... The most detailed investigation of the British child abuse colony in Amsterdam was published in November 2000 by the Award-winning journalist Nick Davies. Now even more evidence was provided for the existence of not only a vast boy trafficking network, but also for the existence of a small number of snuff movies....

The Ockenden Venture was founded in 1951 by three local schoolteachers and took its name from founder Joyce Pearce’s family home ‘Ockenden’ in White Rose Lane, Woking. The Ockenden Venture became a registered charity on 24th February 1955, under the War Charities Act 1940, its objective being to receive young East European people from post-World War II displaced persons camps in Germany and ‘to provide for their maintenance, clothing, education, recreation, health and general welfare’. ..The project had begun in 1951, when Joyce Pearce (1915- 1985) persuaded Woking District Council to help support a holiday for 17 displaced East European teenagers at her sixth form centre at Ockenden House, as part of the Festival of Britain.<br>

Goddard was posted to India in 1943, to take charge of administration for the air command of South East Asia Command (SEAC).

Be sure to listen to the video at the end of the article (but a trigger warning for victims). Phoenix (victim of ritual abuse in the UK) points out the BBC is owned by powerful people who either create or enable the systemic rape/abuse/murder of children.<br>
<br>
As a child, I was raped and tortured at the Ullswater Outward Bound camp in the UK. This camp is architected in a very similar way to Epstein's Island. It was also patronized by the British Royal Family.<br>
<br>
The camp is intimately connected to notorious pedophile Jimmy Savile, Prince Phillip, and Prince Andrew — the latter, now better-known as one of Epstein's collaborators...This current patron of the Ullswater camp — Prince Andrew ..<br>
<br>
Here you can see the Duke of Edinburgh, patron of Ullswater, and his close-friend, notorious child-rapist Jimmy Savile, who was himself a Director of Outward Bound Global.<br>

			<div class="content">Great data dumps!  So much to look through, wish I had more time at the moment.  But right away things came to mind, especially the Princess/Queen Maxima, Queen Beatrix of course.. I'll throw these old links into the mix plus some new:<br>

searchvoat.co/v/GreatAwakening/2591618 Montreal Permindex ties revealed to JFK murder, 1001 Club<br>
"My last submitted post mostly involved Queen Maxima, supporter of Obama administration and Clinton Global Initiative,( older sister of Ines Zorrequieta who reportedly committed suicide in Argentina 6 days ago) and the Dutch Royal family that Queen Maxima married into, mainly Bilderberg and WWF founder AND former Nazi,Prince Bernhard, who worked also for IG Fabarn in their Espionage Unit "NW-7" both before and after WWII ( btw, 5 IG Farben owned or contracted manufacturing plants that produced synthetic rubber "Buna", most of which utilized slave labor, IGF also supplied Zyklon B gas used in gas chambers).<br>
<br>
From this article I'm focusing on the Bilderberg and WWF founder Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, WWF, 1001 Club, Bronfman ties, Canadian ties, Permindex, British Intel ties going back to WWII. <a href="http://canadianpatriot.org/montreal-permindex-ties-revealed-to-jfk-murder-1001-club/" class="postlink">http://canadianpatriot.org/montreal-per ... 1001-club/</a> " ...<br>
