<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Eliasch, a conservative, served in the British government as a non-political special representative of the then Labour Party prime minister Gordon Brown on deforestation and clean energy from 2007 to 2010. He served in different roles for the Conservative Party between 1999 and 2007, as party deputy treasurer (2003–07), special advisor to the leaders of the opposition (William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith) and shadow foreign secretaries (Michael Howard, Francis Maude and Michael Ancram) (1999–2006). He covered Shadow Foreign Relations (2003–2006) as part of the Shadow Foreign Office team. In 2006 he and Michael Ancram set up Global Strategy Forum, a foreign-affairs think tank based in London; he remains president. <br>
<br>
He is chairman of Equity Partners,[4] on the board of directors of Aman Resorts,[6] London Films,[7][clarification needed] the <span style="color:#FF0040">Foundation for Renewable Energy and Environment (FREE)</span>,[8] Longleat and PitchPalace Global.

He has also served on the boards of IMG (2006–13) and the British Paralympics Association (2002-2009), the sports advisory board of Shimon Peres Peace Centre (1997-2016), the advisory boards of the World Peace Foundation (1996-2002), Societe du Louvre (2005-2015), the Centre for Social Justice 2004–2015, the British Olympic Association (2003-2012) and Capstar (2013-2015). He was non-executive chairman and a non-executive director of Starr Managing Agents (2008-2015). He was non-executive chairman of Investcorp Europe (2010-2014). He was non-executive director of Acasta Enterprises (2015–17). He was a member of the Mayors of Jerusalem and Rome's International Business Advisory Councils (2010-2016). He was a trustee of the Kew Foundation (2010-2016). He chaired the Food, Energy and Water security program at RUSI (2010-2016). He was a member of the Mayor of London's (Boris Johnson) International Business Advisory Council (2008-2016).<br>
<br>
In 2005, Eliasch created the Rainforest Trust and purchased for preservation purposes a 400,000-acre (1,600 km2) rainforest area in the heart of the Amazon rainforest near the Madeira River.[12]<br>
<br>
In 2006, he co-founded Cool Earth,[13] a charity he co-chairs, which sponsors local NGOs to conserve endangered rainforest and has over 120,000 registered members.<br>
<br>
In 2007 he was commissioned by HM Government to undertake an independent review on the role of international finance mechanisms to preserve the global forests in tackling climate change, 'The Eliasch Review' ,[14] which was launched by the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street in October 2008. The Eliasch Review has served as a guideline for REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) as part of the international climate change convention.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">In June 2008, the Brazilian and international media reported that the company Gethal, owned by Eliasch, had been issued a fine of R$450 million for alleged illegal deforestation in the Amazon region by IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources).</span>[15][16] Gethal was investigated facing a possible fine but after the investigation ended, Gethal was not fined. Eliasch did not own Gethal at the time when the activities under investigation took place.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Stendhal Syndrome (Ital. La Sindrome di Stendhal) is a 1996 Italian Giallo film written and directed by Dario Argento and starring his daughter Asia Argento, with Thomas Kretschmann and Marco Leonardi. It was the first Italian film to use computer-generated imagery (CGI)...The title refers to a psychological condition in which a subject enters a fugue state induced by the presence of art. Argento said he experienced Stendhal syndrome as a child. While touring Athens with his parents.. The experience was so strong that Argento never forgot it; he immediately thought of it when he came across Graziella Magherini's book about the syndrome, which would become the basis of the film.<br>
<br>
Plot<br>
Detective Anna Manni travels to Florence on the trail of a serial rapist and murderer, Alfredo Grossi. While visiting a museum, Anna is overcome by Stendhal syndrome, a condition which causes the sufferer to become overwhelmed when viewing great works of art. When Alfredo learns of Anna's disorder, he uses it to disable her before he kidnaps her and subjects her to a brutal and sadistic sexual attack. Although she manages to escape, Anna is left deeply traumatized. Alfredo continues to track her movements and is able to capture her again. ..<br>
<br>
Production<br>
Upon release, the alternate title was The Strendahl System.<br>
<br>
Bridget Fonda was originally set to star in the role of Anna, but dropped out before the start of production, and Jennifer Jason Leigh was considered as a possible replacement before Dario Argento eventually cast his own daughter, Asia, in the role.[2] Thomas Kretschmann was cast as Alfredo Grossi because he had previously worked with Asia on the film La Reine Margot (1994) and she recommended him to her father.[3]<br>
<br>
The opening scene was shot in Florence at Italy's famed Uffizi Gallery. Dario Argento is the only director ever granted permission to shoot there</div></blockquote>

Dario directed his own daughter in the brutal rape scene.<br>

Will Draper is the man who went to Russia and brought back Ella Draper nee Gareeva, married her and together they had a son. When they split, he introduced Ella to Ricky Dearman.  Draper has now quietly left the City and with his psychoanalyst wife who used to work for the BBC, started a new business in the countryside [Badwell Ash Holiday Lodges].. leaving the remaining cast of characters/gov't operatives to continue the smoke and mirrors drama to detract from the sloppy globalist elite trail.. <a href="https://www.badwellashholidaylodges.co.uk/about-us" class="postlink">https://www.badwellashholidaylodges.co.uk/about-us</a><br>

It is still to be determined how much of the Hampstead case was true and a coverup and/or a psyop played on the British people by the highest elements of the UK government and the royal family.</div>
