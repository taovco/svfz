			<div class="content">So, I recently watched a Netflix documentary about the fake art scam at the now defunct Knoedler Gallery <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/made-you-look-review-barry-avrich-1234913471/" class="postlink">https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/m ... 234913471/</a> where everyone sat around saying <em class="text-italics">'We didn't know..'  blah blah blah</em>.. as they made huge amounts of money investing in the illusion..  As I watched it I thought, 'I bet there are connections to our pizzagate villains'...<br>
<br>
Well, the first thing I googled was Knoedler Gallery and Art in Embassies... Yup... <br>
<br>
Per Haubro Jensen <a href="http://www.perhaubrojensen.com/about" class="postlink">http://www.perhaubrojensen.com/about</a><br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hofmann" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hofmann</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hans Hofmann (March 21, 1880 – February 17, 1966) was a German-born American painter, renowned as both an artist and teacher. His career spanned two generations and two continents, and is considered to have both preceded and influenced Abstract Expressionism. Born and educated near Munich, he was active in the early twentieth-century European avant-garde and brought a deep understanding and synthesis of Symbolism, Neo-impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism when he emigrated to the United States in 1932.. The influential critic Clement Greenberg considered Hofmann's first New York solo show at Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century in 1944 (along with Jackson Pollock’s in late 1943) as a breakthrough in painterly versus geometric abstraction that heralded abstract expressionism.[5] In the decade that followed, Hofmann's recognition grew through numerous exhibitions, notably at the Kootz Gallery, culminating in major retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1957) and Museum of Modern Art (1963), which traveled to venues throughout the United States, South America, and Europe<br>
<br>
Hofmann is also regarded as one of the most influential art teachers of the 20th century. He established an art school in Munich in 1915 that built on the ideas and work of Cézanne, the Cubists and Kandinsky; some art historians suggest it was the first modern school of art anywhere.[2] After relocating to the United States, he reopened the school in both New York City and Provincetown, Massachusetts until he retired from teaching in 1958 to paint full-time..Some of Hofmann's other key tenets include his push/pull spatial theories, his insistence that abstract art has its origin in nature, and his belief in the spiritual value of art.

<br>
Today, Thursday May 14th, the new Casa de Campo second main entrance and adjoining road- Avenida Rey Juan Carlos I -was officially inaugurated in a private ceremony held at the Casa de Campo Hotel, one of the activities of the “XIII Congreso de Padres e Hijos” being celebrated in Casa de Campo this week.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Taking part in the ceremony was King Juan Carlos I himself, after whom the new road is named. His Majesty King Juan Carlos I, who has visited Casa de Campo before, and most recently in February of this year, is currently back in the Casa de Campo once again and is staying at Casa Grande as the guest of J.Pepe Fanjul.</span><br>
<br>
..Meanwhile the “XIII Congreso de Padres e Hijos” opened today following the arrival of <span style="color:#FFFF00">His Majesty King Juan Carlos I, who was greeted on the tarmac of the La Romana, Casa de Campo Airport by J.Pepe Fanjul, his close personal friend for more than 50 years.</span><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/9xfbt2.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image">Here, in front of a sign that reads “Av. Rey Juan Carlos I”, the ribbon cutting took place and was led by President of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina alongside <span style="color:#FFFF00">His Majesty King Juan Carlos I</span>. Also taking part was Alfy Fanjul and J.Pepe Fanjul, Ramon A. Menendez, <span style="color:#FFFF00">Gustavo Cisneros</span>, Felipe Vicini, as well as the presidencial ministers, Gustavo Montalvo and José Ramón Peralta.

We have lots of posts on the Fanjul brothers, including:<br>

			<div class="content">Casa de Campo, a place only for power <a href="https://gustavojveiga.wordpress.com/2017/07/17/casa-de-campo-un-lugar-solamente-para-el-poder/" class="postlink">https://gustavojveiga.wordpress.com/201 ... -el-poder/</a> (translated from Spanish)<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/166bwr.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"> From left to right, <span style="color:#FFFF00">Cisneros himself</span>, Aznar, three-time Dominican President Leonel Fernández, George W. Bush, Mulroney and, seated, <span style="color:#FFFF00">George Bush Sr.</span>, 90, posed for the camera. The latter visited the country for the first time when he was vice-president of Ronald Reagan.</div></blockquote>

All the roads of the most concentrated conservative power in the United States and Latin America lead to Casa de Campo, in the Dominican Republic. A destination much less known than Punta Cana, but more glamorous and exclusive, it brings together former presidents, billionaires and celebrities from the artistic scene every summer.<br>
<br>
The Bushes, father and son, Colombian Alvaro Uribe and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney have mingled with Bill Gates, Venezuelan media entrepreneur Gustavo Cisneros and Skakira at the most expensive resort in the Caribbean. On the visitor's list there are also former Spanish rulers or representatives of their nobility: José María Aznar and former King Juan Carlos. ...<span style="color:#FFFF00"> The Fanjul family, of Cuban origin, owns the corporation and the tourist center where the Bushes used to meet with Aznar and Uribe at the Cisneros mansion. Entrepreneurs usually host Bill Clinton there. Nothing is a casuality. They financed their electoral campaigns for years.</span><br>
<br>
..From Miami and other cities in the United States, the main lobbyist in Congress for the vulture funds usually travels to Casa de Campo: Democratic Senator Bob Menéndez. It is because of his friendship with Salomón Melgen, a Dominican ophthalmologist based in West Palm Beach, Florida. A friendship showered with thousands of dollars in support of his political campaigns. Much more (about 700 thousand) than those received by the congressman from the owner of the vulture fund NML, Paul Singer (117 thousand officially declared).<br>
<br>
Menéndez attacked the Argentine government because it did not pay its financier the debt bonds and it also does the same with the Dominican Republic because it hinders a Melgen deal in that country: it involves X-rays to verify the content of containers. “He's an ophthalmologist, for Christ's sake. He has no experience in port security, ”complained William Malamud, vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce of Santo Domingo.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">The MelgenMenéndez duo was involved in complaints about unholy parties with minors in the Caribbean country. </span>The congressman's accusations staggered him in the upper house, where he is a heavyweight. A cousin of the doctor and deputy in the Dominican Republic, Vinicio Castillo Semán, came out to defend both of the accusations in February of last year.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>At the end of February, Casa de Campo was honored to be visited by His Majesty King Juan I Carlos of Spain, a close personal friend of Pepe Fanjul for more than 50 years.<br>
<br>
<br>
Having abdicated the throne last year, HM King Juan Carlos I visited Casa de Campo on a personal trip, staying with Pepe Fanjul at the Fanjul’s Casa de Campo estate, Casa Grande.<br>
<br>
Speaking to Pepe Fanjul about the visit of HM King Juan Carlos I, Pepe told Casa de Campo Living “I never discuss my private conversations with the King”, however he did assure us that the King thoroughly enjoyed his vacation in Casa de Campo.<br>
<br>
During his time in Casa de Campo, HM King Juan Carlos I of Spain took the opportunity to rest and relax at Casa Grande, a magnificent oceanside property with it’s own helipad, beach and tennis courts. In addition, HM King Juan Carlos I was seen dining at Casa de Campo resort restaurants; the Beach Club by Le Cirque on Minitas Beach, as well as at La Caña by Il Circo at the Casa de Campo Hotel.<br>
<br>
One afternoon, Pepe Fanjul hosted a lunch at Casa Grande in his honor. The open-air occasion was also attended by president of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina who sat to the right side of His Majesty, while Pepe Fanjul was seated to his left.<br>
<br>
Among the other distinguished guests at Casa Grande were important members of the British establishment, including <span style="color:#FFFF00">Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill and his wife, Lady Sarah as well as Viscount Astor with Lady Annabel.</span> Shooting enthusiasts, Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill and Viscount Astor have been frequent visitors of Casa de Campo over the years, where alongside Pepe they have enjoyed Casa de Campo’s impressive shooting facilities. Casa’s shooting facility boasts a Sporting Clays circuit of more than 200 stations, 2 pigeon rings with Barnaby traps, 1 Colombaire style pigeon ring and a skeet and trap facility. While a short 10 minute helicopter ride, or 25 minute drive outside of the resort lies Rancho Peligro, a private wilderness reserve for European-style Driven Bird Shooting with 6 different drive locations for showing the best possible birds.<br>
<br>
Additional important guests included J.Pepe’s son, Pepe Fanjul Jr., Chairman of the Executive Committee of Central Romana with his wife Lourdes, as well as; Blaine Trump; photographer Jonathan Becker, most famous for his work with Vanity Fair; writer Bob Colacello, well-known for writing profiles on a wide range of public personalities, including the biography of President Ronald Regan, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, Liza Minnelli, Estée Lauder, and Naomi Campbell, as well as his memoir of Andy Warhol “Holy Terror: Andy Warhol Close Up“; Vanity Fair fashion writer, Amy Fine Collins; Countess Christina de Caraman; Earle Irving Mack, the former US Ambassador to Finland; Brian Mulroney the 18th Prime Minister of Canada; famous financiers Wilbur Ross, Wafic Said and Karl Wellner; and movie entrepreneur Peggy Siegel.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/o5d6f8.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote> Juan Carlos I has accumulated friends from different parts of the planet.<br>
<br>
.. Peter Dubens / Boats. The British businessman and owner of the company “North Sails” owns the largest sail factory for ships in the world. This English multimillionaire is one of the regulars of “the friends of the regattas” in which he has liked to participate so much and at present he longs for the self-exiled monarch.<br>
<br>
Peter Dubens is part of the so-called “dream team” of sailors from Sanxenso (A Coruña) together with businessman Pedro Campos, who hosted the disowned monarch on his last night in Spain .<br>
<br>
Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nayan / Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. He is the current host of Juan Carlos in his 'self-exile'. He appeared alongside him in one of the last recently published photographs of the Emeritus. He was the one who gave him his royal suite during his first months in the Emirates, and now he occupies a private residence that is also his property.<br>
<br>
Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nayen / owner of Manchester City.  He is the brother of the previous one (fifth son of the 18 that Emir Zayed II, president of the United Arab Emirates had) and known in Europe, among other reasons, for presiding over Mancherter's second club, City, with Pep Guardiola as coach.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">He is also chairman of Mubudala</span> , the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund that owns Cepsa. A close friend of Juan Carlos, together they have been seen attending various football matches in England.  He owns an 8,200 hectare farm in our country in the municipality of Valencia de las Torres, a town in the south of the province of Badajoz. His fortune is calculated above 20,000 million euros. <br>
<br>
Shah Karim al-Hussayni / Aga Khan IV (title of the Imams of the Nizari Ismailis belonging to Shiism). He is a close friend of Juan Carlos and with a fortune that exceeds, according to the Forbes list, one billion euros and with annual income of more than five hundred million. A friendship that arose when the two met at the Swiss boarding school Le Rosey. At present, Aga Khan is the head of the Foundation for which the Infanta Cristina de Borbón works at the time that the former Duchess of Palma reduced her working relationship with La Caixa .<br>
<br>
The pitch ended first in an account of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Swiss bank Mirabaud</span> . The owner of that account was an instrumental company controlled by the front men of the Spanish king, Arturo Fasana and Dante Canónica. Finally, in September 2012, Juan Carlos I ordered the transfer of the last $ 62 million that remained to the account of his former lover, Corinna Larsen, as a donation. Relations between the King Emeritus and the Saudi royal family remain excellent nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Vasco de Manuel Quevedo Pereira Coutinho /  Portuguese banker owner of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Banco del Espíritu Santo</span> and billionaire. An excellent friend of Juan Carlos, so much so that in April 2011 he granted him the title of Marqués de Pereira Coutinho of new creation that went almost unnoticed because the reason why such high dignity was given in the BOE of its publication was not specified .<br>
<br>
..the Borbón and Pereira Coutinho families ..<br>
<br>
Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa / Sultan of Bahrain. Juan Carlos I delivered in Geneva , in 2010, 1.9 million dollars (1.7 million euros) that he had received as a donation from the King of Bahrain (an archipelago of more than 30 islands located in the Persian Gulf) to the manager of his account Swiss in the <span style="color:#FFFF00">Mirabaud bank, the lawyer Arturo Fasana</span>, according to his statement to the prosecutor Yves Bertossa.<br>
