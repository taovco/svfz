<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Elisabeth Jenny Jeanne "Betty" Maxwell (née Meynard; 11 March 1921 – 7 August 2013) was a French-born researcher on the Holocaust who established the journal <em class="text-italics">Holocaust and Genocide Studies</em> in 1987.[1] She was married to publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell from 1945 until his death in 1991 ... Later in life, she was recognized for her work as a proponent of Interfaith dialogue and received several awards including an honorary fellowship from the Woolf Institute at Cambridge...<br>
<br>
Maxwell was born Elisabeth Jenny Jeanne Meynard in La Grive, near Saint-Alban-de-Roche, France, to Louis "Paul" Meynard and Colombe (née Petel) Meynard.[1][5] Paul Meynard was a Protestant descendant of the Huguenot upper class and Colombe Meynard was a Roman Catholic (whose marriage to a Protestant resulted in her excommunication)...  Her parents sent her to England at age nine to attend the convent of Our Lady of Compassion at Acocks Green in Birmingham.[6] In 1932, she returned to France. Meynard studied law at the Sorbonne.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">In September 1944, after the Liberation of Paris, she met Czechoslovakian-born British Army Captain Robert Maxwell, while working as an interpreter for the 'Welcome Committee', which introduced French people to allied officers; they married on 15 March 1945.</span><br>
<br>
In her forties, Maxwell worked in public relations for her husband's company and campaigned for him in the general election of 1964; he was elected as the Labour MP for Buckingham. <span style="color:#FFFF40">She then earned a BA degree in modern languages at St Hugh's College, Oxford.</span><br>
<br>
In 1981, at the age of 60, Maxwell was awarded a PhD in French Literature from the University of Oxford for her thesis on The art of Letter Writing in France, 1789-1830.[12][13] Her thesis work focused on researching a Protestant circle in Lyons.<br>
<br>
Maxwell was an editor for the book Remembering for the <em class="text-italics">Future: the Holocaust in an Age of Genocide</em>, a comprehensive work including the contributions of nearly 200 scholars, published in 2001.[23][24] According to BBC News, Maxwell served as the executive chairman of the Remembering for the Future organization and was the opening speaker for the London conference <em class="text-italics">Evil and Indifference: Is there an End to Genocide?</em> held at Westminster Hall in July 2000.[25] She was on the Executive Committee of the International Council of Christians and Jews and founded the International Conference on the Holocaust.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Looking at the attendees of that first Holocaust conference provides quite an impressive list of academics and politicians.. I wondered about Betty's influence and list of contacts... and started by looking at her first degree at Oxford University which she attended in the mid-Sixties...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>It was founded in 1886 by Elizabeth Wordsworth as a women's college, and accepted its first male students in its centenary year in 1986.... In 1943 the college acquired the leasehold of 72 Woodstock Road (known as The Shrubbery) from Dame Gertrude Whitehead for £1,500. It was used as a club for American soldiers during the war.[16] In 1946, it was leased to the University of Paris as the Maison française d'Oxford, an Anglo-French educational establishment. One of the cottages in the grounds of number 72 was later leased by Barbara Gwyer after her retirement as principal.<br>
<br>
1945 onwards<br>
<br>
The college buildings were de-requisitioned in 1945. The hospital huts were initially leased as offices to university departments, including the Bureau of Animal Population, the Department of Zoological Field Studies and the Institute of Statistics, before being demolished in 1952.[16] <span style="color:#FFFF40">Agnes Headlam-Morley</span>, a fellow of St Hugh's, became the first woman to hold a chair at the University of Oxford in 1948.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>First consider a puzzle. In IR’s intellectual and disciplinary history, women appear to be less present between the late 1940s and 1980s than at any time in the first half of the 20th century (Owens, 2018). This is puzzling because we tend to think of women’s position as improving through the course of the twentieth-century, especially as their access to higher education increased. So why does their position seem to regress in IR?..<br>
<br>
Consider one of the most disparaged figures in the break from diplomatic history, Agnes Headlam-Morley, the first women to become a full Professor at the University of Oxford... An historian of Anglo-German relations and one-time would-be Tory MP, at Oxford she was a famed salon hostess..<br>
<br>
The consensus among the chroniclers of IR’s history is that she failed to develop the subject because she continued to view IR as a subfield of History. .. for Martin Ceadel, Agnes’s intellectual interests were ‘inherited’ from her father, James, an historian and senior civil servant who helped draft the Treaty of Versailles (Ceadel, 2014: 189). On this account, IR’s fortunes only revived after Agnes’s retirement in 1971 and the return to Oxford of Hedley Bull, who held the Montagu Burton Chair between 1977 and 1985.<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FFFF40">Headlam-Morley appears on the very last page of Carroll Quigley’s infamous book, <em class="text-italics">The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden</em>,on the Anglophone network seeking to establish global racial supremacy through imperial federation.</span> ‘[T]he great idealistic adventure which began with <span style="color:#FFFF40">Toynbee and Milner</span> in 1875 had slowly ground its way to a finish of bitterness and ashes’ when this ‘middle-aged spinster… with one publication to her credit’ sat in the Oxford chair (1981: 310).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>From 1918 to 1950, Toynbee was considered a leading specialist on international affairs...However, by the 1960s his magnum opus had fallen out of favour among mainstream historians due to a perception that Toynbee favoured myths, allegories and religion over factual data.<br>
<br>
Toynbee (born in London on 14 April 1889) was the son of Harry Valpy Toynbee (1861–1941), secretary of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Charity Organization Society</span>, and his wife Sarah Edith Marshall (1859–1939)... In 1912 he became a tutor and fellow in ancient history at Balliol College, and in 1915 he began working for the intelligence department of the British Foreign Office.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">My friend, the late Robert Green, wrote to me on 16 November 2018. It was one of the last communications I received from him, as shortly thereafter the illness that led to his death took hold. His letter, like so much of his writing, was ahead of its time. It looked at the conduct of those who are only now are being examined by the mainstream media and the Holyrood parliament: Alex Salmond and Leslie Evans, the Head of the Scottish Civil Service.<br>
<br>
In addition to raising questions over the conduct of Leslie Evans, questions still unanswered to this day, and to commenting, very wisely as it would turn out, on the allegations then facing Alex Salmond, Robert raised a further and most important issue. This was <span style="color:#FF0040">the conduct of the former Lord Advocate (chief law officer of the Scottish Government), Dame Elish Angiolini.</span><br>
<br>
Dame Elish has recently provided a report entitled "Policing — complaints handling, investigations and misconduct issues: an independent review." Based on her work, the Scottish Government, and the present Lord Advocate, James Wolffe QC, have announced "bold reform".<br>
<br>
From the grave, Robert Green asks us to examine whether we can trust any of those involved in this "boldness". His words highlight the depths of corruption in the Scottish state and the lack of any means for redress for the Scottish people. This letter, now posthumously published in full, highlights the pressing need for transparency and openness in Scottish public life.</em><br>
<br>
Since the news of sexual allegations made against Alex Salmond broke in late August [2018], intermittent speculation about this issue has been published from time to time. When the matter first emerged, I was contacted by a wide range of individuals, asking if the allegations could have had any link with the former First Minister's connection with the Hollie Greig case.<br>
<br>
..When the news first came into the public domain, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon went to considerable lengths to clarify that she had nothing to do with the decision to pursue the investigation [of Alex Salmond] and that it had been independently initiated by Leslie Evans. It may be that Ms Evans had justifiable reason to take the steps she did, but such steps are surely inconsistent when compared with her evasions over <span style="color:#FF0040">what appears to be overwhelming evidence of probable criminal behaviour on the part of Elish Angiolini, former Lord Advocate and ministerial colleague of Mr Salmond</span>.<br>
<br>
In October 2015, I raised concerns to Audit Scotland over the funding of Mrs Angiolini's civil action against me, an action she took when fundamentally accusing me of wrongly stating that she was implicated in the Hollie Greig case. I already had evidence to indicate that my position was the correct one, in fact, including a letter copied to my MP, Health Minister David Mowat, by former Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill that clearly stated that<span style="color:#FF0040"> it was indeed Elish Angiolini who had personally blocked the investigation into Hollie's rape allegations</span>, contrary to everything Ms Angiolini had previously asserted.<br>
<br>
After a five-month investigation, Audit Scotland revealed that Mrs Angiolini had, as I suspected, been granted UK taxpayers' funds in order to pursue me in a matter that may lead to her own financial enrichment. The said funding had been authorised by Leslie Evans' immediate predecessor, Sir Peter Housden. The only possible way that Ms Angiolini could have persuaded Sir Peter to grant such funding to her was to convince him that she was telling the truth in that she was not involved in the Hollie Greig case, a position we now know to be utterly untrue.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, in order to process this matter further, I asked Leslie Evans to provide copies of the correspondence between Elish Angiolini and Sir Peter that had led to his authorisation.<br>
<br>
Leslie Evans refused to comply.<br>
<br>
My [then] MP, David Mowat, took up my case, as it involved the very probable misuse of UK public funds (the matter is not devolved) and likely fraud.<br>
<br>
Again, Leslie Evans refused to comply.<br>
<br>
Mr Mowat was succeeded after the 2017 General Election by Labour's Mr Faisal Rashid. For the same reason as Mr Mowat, Mr Rashid also approached Ms Evans for copies of the relevant correspondence.<br>
<br>
Once more, Leslie Evans refused to comply.<br>
<br>
When the action was taken to investigate the allegations made against Mr Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon also emphasised how it demonstrated that no-one in Scotland was above the law.<br>
<br>
Why then, is a former First Minister being pursued on the opinion of Leslie Evans, over sexual allegations made from some years ago, but a former Lord Advocate, against whom there is overwhelming documentary evidence of grave financial misconduct, most probably of a criminal nature, and having been supplied by the Scottish Government itself, being actively protected by the very same individual — Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans?

[A blog about Jimmy Savile] <span style="color:#00FF40">Sir Fixed it for Jim</span> <a href="https://archive.is/F3NGf" class="postlink">https://archive.is/F3NGf</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="text-decoration:underline">How did Jim fix it so that his child abuse was never examined?</span></span><br>
<br>
As was the case with Thomas Hamilton after the Dunblane tragedy, many people seem to have known about Savile’s abuse, but why was nothing done about it at the time it was taking place?<br>
<br>
Did whistleblowers try to get the authorities to act? Or were they put off by his obvious power and influence?<br>
<br>
The initial rumours suggested that only one police force, the Surrey Constabulary had investigated an allegation of abuse against Savile in the 1970s, which could not be substantiated....<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FFFF80">Prince Charles and Sir Jimmy Savile (pictured with deputy Lord lieutenant Iain Thornber) at Glencoe in 1999</span> <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/21ewiv.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image">  </div></blockquote>

...At the Dunblane Public Inquiry that followed the mass murder of children at Dunblane Primary School the evidence of one anonymous victim of Thomas Hamilton’s sexual abuse on board his cabin cruiser, (Hamilton had two boats the large cabin cruiser, Tropical Linda and the smaller speed boat Lady Sheila, both said to have been bought from the police at unrealistically low prices), at Loch Lomond was traduced by the Lord Advocate’s representative to such an extent that Lord Cullen in his Report concluded that he “ did not find this allegation to have been proved” and in effect allowed Thomas Hamilton to be considered to have been a decent man, with no proven history of sexual abuse!<br>
<br>
This revisionism had the effect of giving a post mortem character reference for Thomas Hamilton, signed by Lord Cullen, despite the fact that his abuse of boys at his Loch Lomond camps was well known and had been reported to the police. These and other incidents had made him known to half the police forces in Scotland and had seen him dismissed from the Scout movement....<br>
<br>
..In Scotland, The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is responsible for the prosecution of crime usually following reports from the police. However COPFS are also responsible for the investigation of complaints against the police.<br>
<br>
The Housemaster’s story made allegations against the “toffs” who took boys from the school, the school authorities, some of the older pupils, and the police who broke down the door of his home and took his possessions. So I thought they might be the relevant body to approach.<br>
<br>
The head of COPFS is the Lord Advocate, at the relevant time, Colin Boyd, but he had refused me access or knowledge of the Dunblane Inquiry documents – held under a non-statutory 100-year closure – when I had asked to see them in connection with reference to Queen Victoria School...<br>
<br>
Given the Lord Advocate’s intransigence, I decided not to go to him, but to<span style="color:#FF0040"> the Solicitor General, Elish Angiolini </span>for help.<br>
<br>
I was aware that simply writing to the Solicitor General by name was unlikely to reach her desk so decided that in a matter of some importance such as this I would deliver my complaint by Messenger at Arms and by so doing ensure that the complaint was taken seriously.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">My attempts to elicit a serious response from Elish Angiolini (nee McPhilomy), the Solicitor General for Scotland were of little effect as she simply refused to accept them on two occasions from the Messenger at Arms, but did advise me to go to the police despite the fact that she knew The Housemaster’s complaint was, in part, about the police, and their failure to act, before acting maliciously.</span></div></blockquote>

Lord Weidenfeld was another patron...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">George Weidenfeld, Baron Weidenfeld</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Weidenfeld,_Baron_Weidenfeld" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_We ... Weidenfeld</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>George Weidenfeld, Baron Weidenfeld, GBE (13 September 1919 – 20 January 2016) was a British publisher, philanthropist, and newspaper columnist. He was also a lifelong Zionist[1] and renowned as a master networker. He was on good terms with popes, prime ministers and presidents and put his connections to good use for diplomatic and philanthropic ends..<br>
<br>
By 1942 he was a political commentator for the BBC and also wrote a weekly newspaper column, coming into contact with General de Gaulle and Tito as a result.[5] In 1949, Weidenfeld served for a year as the political adviser and Chief of Cabinet to Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel.[5] In that role, Weidenfeld launched a campaign to convince the world that Israel should keep western Jerusalem.[6] The city had been divided between Israel and the Hashemite Kingtom of Transjordan after the two sides signed an armistice agreement earlier in the year...<br>
<br>
In 1948, Weidenfeld co-founded the publishing firm Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson with Nigel Nicolson...Over the years, the firm published many outstanding titles, including <span style="color:#FFFF40">the British edition of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita in 1959</span> and Nicolson's biography of his parents, Portrait of a Marriage (1973).<br>
<br>
In 1985, Weidenfeld's publishing interests expanded to the United States, when he acquired the Grove Press in partnership with<span style="color:#FF0040"> Ann Getty (wife of Gordon Getty)</span>. Grove later merged with the New York division of Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson to form Grove Nicolson. In 1991 Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson's UK branch was sold to the Orion Publishing Group[3] and became Orion's main non-fiction imprint, with Weidenfeld as non-executive chairman.<br>
<br>
..In 1993, the American company, Grove Nicolson, merged with the Atlantic Monthly Press to form Grove/Atlantic Inc. In 2005 he arranged the publication of Memory and Identity by John Paul II. Weidenfeld was also <span style="color:#FF0040">Joint Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Blavatnik School of Government in Oxford</span>; Adviser to the Board of Axel Springer AG Berlin and a columnist for the Berlin newspapers Die Welt, Welt am Sonntag and Bild Zeitung. In January 2006 the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, founded as The Club of Three[7][8] in the 1990s, was established with Weidenfeld as its <span style="color:#FF0040">Leadership Programme in Oxford</span> and, in 2010, founded the <span style="color:#FF0040">Humanitas Programme of Visiting Chairs at Oxford and Cambridge.</span><br>
<br>
Philanthropy<br>
Weidenfeld served in many philanthropic capacities including Chairman of the Ben Gurion University of the Negev (1996–2004), <span style="color:#FF0040">Governor of the <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Weizmann Institute</span></span>, Vice-Chairman of the EU-Israel Forum, member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute at the University of Oxford, Trustee, Royal Opera House (1974–87) and Trustee of the National Portrait Gallery (1988–95). He co-founded the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Trust[9] at Oxford University, one of the largest post-graduate scholarship programmes at Oxford. He also established the "Weidenfeld Safe Havens Fund", which intends to support Christians fleeing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,[10] although its focus on Christians has caused some criticism..<br>
<br>
Weidenfeld married Jane Sieff in 1952, daughter of Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff[16] who was a part of the family that controlled Marks and Spencer. ..After their divorce, he married Barbara Skelton (1916–1996), the English memoirist, novelist and socialite, in 1956, who had previously been married to Cyril Connolly...His third marriage was to Sandra Payson Meyer (1926–2004) in 1966.[18][20] She was the daughter of Americans Charles Shipman Payson and Joan Whitney, of the Whitney family.[21][22][23] They divorced 10 years later in 1976...<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">He was a staunch supporter of Israel and was described as an "adamantine Zionist". Among his friends were politicians Angela Merkel and Kurt Waldheim.</span></div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Genocide Prevention Research Initiative,<span style="color:#FFFF40"> known as Aegis</span>, will bring together academics from around the globe. It will research the causes of genocide and suggest strategies for future intervention by governments and organisations to try to stop it happening again.<br>

Launched in the UK, the project has the backing of many distinguished academics and politicians.<br>

Friday's launch forms part of a day-long event called Evil and Indifference: Is there an End to Genocide? Open to the public it is expected to attract around 500 people to London's Westminster Central Hall. The event is being organised by Remembering For The Future, an organisation which aims to increase world-wide knowledge of the holocaust. Its executive chairman Dr Elisabeth Maxwell, widow of Robert Maxwell, will open proceedings.<br>

Gregg, who helped build up the family business and also worked as a social worker, teacher and headmaster, lost a bid to have his convictions overturned at London‘s Court of Appeal on Tuesday [2017].<br>

But senior judges said his jail term, imposed at Newcastle Crown Court, was ‘too long’ and reduced it to eight-and-a-half years.<br>

<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">Best of: Sir Crispin Davis and James Murdoch Leave GSK Board </span><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2016/04/best-of-sir-crispin-davis-and-james-murdoch-leave-gsk-board.html" class="postlink">https://www.ageofautism.com/2016/04/bes ... board.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We are running this "Best of" in light of the VaXed, The Movie controversy having been pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival and subsequently thrust into the limelight.  From January, 2012.<br>
<br>
The Wall Street Journal reports that <span style="color:#FFFF40">James Murdoch, son of beleaguered media mogul Rupert Murdoch, whose empire is embroiled in scandal, has stepped down  from the GlaxoSmithKline board</span>.   In addition, <span style="color:#FF0040">Sir Crispin Davis, former Chief Executive of Reed Elsevier, which owns The Lancet, which published the paper that included Dr. Andrew Wakefield's MMR information,  is leaving the board after a nine year tenure.</span><br>
<br>
...Glaxo said Mr Murdoch’s decision to turn his back on the £98,000 role was entirely his own.<br>
<br>
Chairman Chris Gent said: ‘James has taken this decision to focus on his current duties as non-executive chairman of BSkyB and following his decision to re-locate to the United States as chairman and chief executive, international, of News Corporation.’<br>
<br>
John Stone has written about both Murdoch and Davis and their proximity to the Dr. Andrew Wakefield MMR Lancet Paper BMJ topic.<br>
<br>
..James Murdoch, the beleagured News Corporation executive, has received a ringing endorsement from MMR manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline according to Reuters news agency on Friday. GSK who appointed him to their board in February 2009 insist Murdoch has made “a strong contribution” to the group and received share payments worth $158,000 in 2010. Murdoch was appointed to the board of the pharmaceutical manufacturer with a brief to “review…external issues that might have the potential for serious impact upon the group's business and reputation."<br>
<span style="color:#FFFF40">Within a fortnight of his appointment News International had published at least 5 articles attacking MMR researcher Andrew Wakefield’s integrity.</span><br>
<br>
The accusations, while flawed, were devastating to Wakefield’s reputation. According to the Sunday Times, and its journalist, Brian Deer Wakefield was singly guilty of fabricating the data in the Lancet paper of 1998 although none of his 12 co-authors have ever repudiated it and one of them, histopathologist, Susan Davies subsequently wrote to British Medical Journal rebutting Deer’s interpretation of her evidence before the General Medical Council. Deer’s allegations were also based on his own inexpert interpretation of GP records which were never available to the authors of the paper. The allegations which were re-cycled by British Medical Journal were rebutted by Wakefield in his book Callous Disregard, and frequently in articles published on Age of Autism (AofA The Big Lie , AofA Time To Revisit Deer's Claims , AofA Part 2 Time To Revisit Deer's Claims ). In contrast to normal academic journal policy BMJ have adopted a legalistic defence of its allegations and (more here). Furthermore, they were forced to admit under pressure that they had undisclosed conflicts with MMR manufacturers Merck and GSK.<br>
<br>
...Sir Crispin Davis, until recently chief executive of Reed Elsevier which owns the Lancet, failed to disclose his own conflicts while denouncing Andrew Wakefield to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in March 2004. Sir Crispin failed to disclose either that he was a non-executive director of MMR defendants, GlaxoSmithKline, or that it was his own brother Sir Nigel Davis who had endorsed the Legal Services Commission’s decision to pull the plug on the funding of the case in the High Court 3 days before <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmsctech/399/4030107.htm" class="postlink">https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/c ... 030107.htm</a></div></blockquote></div>
