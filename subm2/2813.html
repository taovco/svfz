This compilation of images (no sound) goes in depth into public information about Michael Louis Giacalone, friend of James Alefantis and Tony Podesta. He used very rare nickname (used only by very few people on the internet) that is also used by person signing under site about homosexual pedophilia stories. That nickname is celadon. Interestingly Giacalone is homosexual ... He follows young men from his Instagram, and even younger boys. He is friends with many original suspects in Pizzagate research including Maccoby family, Michael Maccoby, Izette Maccoby Folger, Victoria Lynn Reis, and also he seems to be connected to Virginia Von Furstenberg from family of Furstenberg who are known associates of Ghislaine Maxwell/Epstein circle.<br>
<br>
00:00 - 01:28 - I make introduction to Michael Louis Giacalone, his LinkedIn profile listing him as ex Migrations Operations Officer at UN (Rome-D.C.) and now as Public Relations Officer at Italian Embassy in D.C. His Twitter profile (celadon61), his, his Instagram profile (michael_I_giaca, previously celadon61), his Facebook profile (Michele Giacalone) I show article about his work at Italy Embassy in D.C.<br>
<br>
01:28 - 06:02 - I show Maccoby family socializing together with Michael Giacalone, Carole Feld and Kate Damon for example - in order to organize their effort around helping children of Haiti. I show how Kate Damon commented suspicious pictures of James Alefantis, how Michael Maccoby is coaching leaders at NPH - organizations working with orphanages in different places of the world. <br>
I show his son Max Maccoby being on board of directors of one such organization named Friends of the Orphans, and Izette Maccoby Folger working on advisory board of Innocents at Risk - organization combating child trafficking. Michael Maccoby was defending Comet Ping Pong of James Alefantis back in 2008. Max Maccoby on the other hand was listed in counsel for David Brock and James Alefantis. Friends of the Orphans connected to Max and Michael Maccoby was - according to Puello (fake lawyer of Silsby and her crew, Puello got arrested for human trafficking) - place from which Silsby and her crew took some of the children she was trying to get out of Haiti. Bill Clinton intervened in that case as well as he himself was connected to Friends of the Orphans.<br>
<br>
06:03 - 07:17 - I start with posting picture of a child in hands of James Alefantis, picture liked by  Izette Folger and Justin Barrows (jabbaroos) who was connected as man who build Comet Ping Pong and had suspicious Instagram activities and was on adoption day (on which Bill Clinton friends were too btw) Izette Folger is following Michael Giacalone on Instagram. Another person following Michael Giacalone is Victoria Lynn Reis who liked cartoon image of child being eaten on Justin Barrows profile (jabbaroos) and commented suspicious James Alefantis empty walk in fridge - James commented "murder", his friend commented "killroom", Victoria commented "where do the werewolves lock themselves up during the full moon?"<br>
<br>
07:18 - 08:33 - Now I start showing people being followed by Michael Giacalone. Among them Izette Maccoby Folger, Victoria Lynn Reis. Giacalone calls Izette Maccoby Folger his best friend in DC and pictures himself with her. Giacalone is following James Alefantis on Instagram. James Alefantis takes pictures with Victoria Lynn Reis and Izette Maccoby Folger and call them his "dear friends".<br>
<br>
08:34 - 10:01 - Michael Giacalone pictures headless figure in house of Tony Podesta, he calls Tony Podesta his friend, this is same place and figure that are on James Alefantis own picture on his Instagram profile jimmycomet, also same place where Tony Podesta and James Alefantis were photographed together when they were presenting something to group of people. Interestingly Michael Giacalone changed his nickname from celadon61 to michael_I_giaca, probably because some people started accusing him. We can still find archived Michael's picture of that headless figure in Tony Podesta house, and where Michael was still nicknamed celadon61. Celadon nickname is interesting because it's very rare to see it used by the people on the internet (very few people use it) and interestingly it is nickname used by person signing himself under pedophile site with pedo-homosexual stories for homosexual pedophiles, at least two versions of this site exist with someone nicknamed celadon signed under it.<br>
<br>
10:01 - 11:28 - I show Biljana Djurdjevic paintings depicting children in distress and in pedophile sadist scenes, she is Serbian artist and friend of Tony Podesta and James Alefantis, both of these man are connected to Giacalone, it seems to indicate they have very vile pedophilic taste in general. James Alefantis and Podesta are Facebook friends with Djurdjevic, she was liking pizza picture of James, James and Djurdjevic are following each other on Instagram.<br>
<br>
11:29 - 14:10 - I'm pointing out that Michael Louis Giacalone could be .. or not ... related to that person nicknamed celadon signing under pedophile site. He is using the same nickname, he is connected ...no ... he is very close friends with people who were accused of running massive pedophile ring and there could be some basis to accusations based on research we already have. But when you actually research further Michael Louis Giacalone is homosexual when you take closer look at his Instagram profile. He is following profiles named " irresistible boys " , men who looks very young, and while most of it is adult stuff it still gives very creepy vibe. But when you research further you can also find that he is following two boys who probably are very young. So Giacalone has common nickname with person signing himself under homosexual pedophile site, common sexual orientation with people that are target of this site, friends who are accused of running massive pedo ring. Strange "coincidences", right?<br>
<br>
14:11 - 16:15 - And that's not even the strangest stuff. He is Italian so it makes sense for him to be connected to famous Italian people especially if he's around elite circles ( as I assume he is ) but he is following private account of Virginia Von Furstenberg from the house of Furstenberg. There are MANY interesting members of that family who are connected to Jeffrey Epstein/Ghislaine Maxwell circle. Diane Von Furstenberg son Alex Von Furstenberg is listed in Ghislaine/Epstein's Black book alongside Alex then-wife Alexandra Von Furstenberg. Alex was a shareholder in the same private social network as Epstein and Lynn Rothschild. Diane Von Furstenberg is socializing with ex wife of Jeffrey Epstein associate Prince Andrew, she's also socializing with Naomi Campbell who is big associate of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Diane is also socializing with Andre Balazs, hotelier who is strongly connected to Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein and Marina Abramovic. Diane's son Alexander was listed as shareholder alongside Harvey Weinstein in the private social network used by Jeffrey Epstein and Lynn Rothschild. Diane's husband Barry Diller was accused of covering up a sexual assault. Diane Von Furstenberg was socializing with Matthew Freud who is connected to Ghislaine Maxwell. Tatiana Von Furstenberg was mingling with Prince Andrew in house of Ghislaine Maxwell. So as you can see Furstenbergs are very connected to Jeffrey Epstein/Ghislaine Maxwell circle and it's interesting to see Michael Giacalone being connected to this family in some way.<br>
<br>
16:16 - 17:18 - Michael Louis Giacalone is following J Scott Cunningham on Instagram. J Scott Cunningham was traveling with James Alefantis to Turkey (where James tagged Scott so Scott could see his strange picture with suspicious woman and little girl behind her in Topkapi Sarayi), Venice (for Venice Biennale to Axel Vervoordt's exhibitions (Axel was accused of being pedo/child trafficker and art smuggler in 90s/early 2000s, Axel also friends with Marina Abramovic who on other hand is friends with Tony Podesta), or Mexico where as we know - NXIVM was trying to infiltrate politics and lots of powerful organized crime is going on.<br>
<br>
17:19 - 21:04 - In this part I show few more important social connections of Michael Giacalone. At Transformer DC Collector's View 2016 he is pictured laughing and having conversation together with James Alefantis. On same event he is sitting beside Izette Maccoby Folger. On same event there is Dana Rooney (friend of James), Victoria Lynn Reis, Carole Feld. Dana Rooney is pictured together with James Alefantis and Paul Sherrill on Sherrill's Instagram profile. Michael Giacalone is following Paul Sherrill's profile on Instagram, he is very close to that circle of people. On different Transformer's Collector' View event Michael Giacalone is pictured with Dana Rooney, James Alefantis present in other pictures, also Kate Damon is present who once commented suspicious picture of taped little girl named Caris as pictured on James profile. Kate Damon is principal/owner at Kaze Design, among few things she says she is passionate about politics, transformer and saving the oceans. At Kaze Design it seems she works with James Huckenpahler who is friends with original Pizzagate suspects - James Alefantis and few others, and through picture and likely some cooperation linked to Nilay Lawson. Both Nilay Lawson and Huckenpahler were interested in underground D.C. tunnels (not mentioned in compilation. Nilay Lawson commented James Alefantis #killroom picture in suspicious, cryptic way, she said "Just rinse it off when youre done".<br>
<br>
Finally I show that James Alefantis is Facebook friends with Michael Louis Giacalone aka celadon61.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Here’s something you can be sure <span style="color:#FF0040">Franklin College</span> won’t be highlighting in its student-recruitment marketing: All three of the former Celadon Group Inc. executives charged this year in what prosecutors call a sweeping accounting fraud graduated from the tiny liberal arts school from 2002 to 2006.<br>
<br>
That might sound like trivia, but critics of Celadon management say it points to deep-seated problems with the company’s clubby culture that helped propel the Indianapolis-based trucking giant toward financial ruin.<br>
<br>
Svindland, a turnaround expert hired in 2017 to right Celadon, soon found himself grappling with fallout from Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department probes into accounting practices by prior management.<br>
<br>
“The sole reason we weren’t able to close on a $200M refinance package back in June of 2018 was because we received a subpoena from the DOJ,” Svindland said in his email. <br>
<br>
..The Justice Department has accused three executives of using accounting chicanery in 2016 and 2017 to mask tens of millions of losses suffered by Quality Cos., a Celadon subsidiary that owned trucks and leased them to drivers.<br>
<br>
Prosecutors in April charged former Quality Cos. President Danny Williams, 36, who immediately struck a plea agreement, and on Dec. 5 they announced indictments against former Celadon President Eric Meek, 39, and former Celadon Chief Financial Officer Bobby Peavler, 40. The court entered automatic not-guilty pleas for both men
