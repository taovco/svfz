<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1. Respondent 2. Aaron Dover 3. First 4. Exhibits “AD1” (Documents) and “AD2” (CD Rom) 5. 3 July 2014 In the High Court of Justice             Claim no: HQ13X03647 Queen’s Bench Division <br>
<br>
BETWEEN:- LMR Partners LLP And Ben Levine Andrew Manuel Stefan Renold Shane Cullinane Claimant And Aaron Dover<br>
<br>
Witness Statement of Aaron Dover<br>
<br>
I, Aaron Dover of 16 Wentworth Mansions, NW3 2RL, unemployed, state the following. 1.I was one of the original five persons who founded LMR Partners LLP (“LMR”) in 2009. The four others were Ben Levine, Andrew Manuel, Stefan Renold and Shane Cullinane. I joined as an employee on the understanding agreed with Ben Levine that after a year of proving my worth I would be give equity (or its equivalent) in the firm. On 23rd December 2010 I was invited to join the partnership on terms which were fraudulently misrepresented to me, as is discussed extensively elsewhere. Upon discovering the true situation I was immediately removed from the partnership by my partners without notice by bike courier to my home on a Sunday evening in November 2011. In April 2012 a settlement agreement was reached under which I would be paid $1 million USD, which was around two thirds of my full 3% profit share already due to me for my work of 2011. By contrast Ben Levine’s profit share for the same year was around $18 million USD, Andrew Manuel’s was a similar amount, and Stefan Renold’s was around $9 million USD. Shane Cullinane’s profit share for the same year was around $2 million. These figures, which are only approximate, are relevant to understanding the vast amounts of money that were being made, and the enormous value of my rightful part of the business that was taken from me by deceit. <br>
<br>
....Since LMR fired me I have worked for Marble Bar Asset Management, Prologue Capital and Credit Suisse. None of these roles offered anywhere close to the remuneration I would have received from my part of LMR. Furthermore, I did not leave any of these four jobs by choice, and I believe the conduct of the applicants, starting with their badmouthing of me to investors of Prologue Capital, has been responsible directly or indirectly for this devastating series of events. I now find myself unemployed without realistic prospects of continuing in my career to date.<br>

...At the time of sending many of the emails described by the Applicants, in particular those at the end of February immediately prior to the un-staying of these proceedings, I believe that I was in a very poor state of mind and that some of the decisions I was making about how to escape from this dispute would seem on reflection to be irrational and self-destructive. I would ask the court to consider my poor mental health as a mitigating factor. Sir Robert Owen QC in the hearing of 5 Mar 2014 used the phrase to describe me as being at times “unable to contain emotions” and I think this is a very accurate description of the situation. I have at times felt enraged, despairing, scared or just hopeless. To clarify this point further, I do not have a long history of mental illness...<br>
<br>
... I got engaged to be married to Claudina Castelli. Claudina was my partner throughout the whole dispute until March 2014 when we separated. The dispute overshadowed both our lives throughout the period since November 2011 ..<br>
<br>
..The fact that Andrew Manuel had been fired for allegedly being a rogue trader was concealed from me throughout my time at LMR and it was concealed from other staff and from the investors. It was very disturbing to me indeed when I discovered the letter on the shared drive because I had been Andrew Manuel’s business partner and also had invested in the fund. Had I known about his dubious career history I would certainly never have joined the firm and I could have avoided the catastrophic impact these people have had on my life and the lives of those close to me. ..<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">I was also told and it is represented in LMR marketing materials that Andrew Manuel briefly worked for Torsten de Santos, former CEO of LGT Capital Management in early 2009. Torsten de Santos was appointed Director of LMR Partners (Offshore) Ltd, a company incorporated in Cayman Islands (reg 228199) in July 2009</span>. This company made substantial investments in the LMR fund. LGT were an early stage investor in the LMR fund and as such were entitled to preferential fee arrangements...</div></blockquote></div>

Bloomberg and the Manhattan Swamp<br>
<br>
The extent of the Maxwell-Bloomberg relationship is unknown, though Bloomberg’s deep ties to his former employer Salomon Brothers is a possible link, given that that firm served as one of the Maxwell family’s main investment bankers in the years prior to and following Robert Maxwell’s mysterious death in 1991. Similarly, Epstein had close ties to prominent figures on Wall Street, some dating back to his time at Bear Stearns, who are also close to Bloomberg.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Channing was born in Dover, Massachusetts, to Dr. Walter Channing, a physician, and Eleine Taylor Channing, a painter and clothing designer.[4] His older sister, Cornelia “Nina” Channing, went on to become a prominent researcher in the field of endocrinology and fertility...<br>
<br>
Business<br>
Channing began his career in computer programming, working for <span style="color:#00FF40">Honeywell and Raytheon</span>.[16]<br>
<br>
In 1968, with a partner, Barry Weinberg, Channing founded Channing, Weinberg &amp; Co., Inc., a management consulting firm for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, medical device and biotechnology companies.[17] The company was the leading strategy consultant to the health-equipment industry.[18] It also sponsored In Vivo, a bi-monthly publication on business and medicine.[19] In 1983, Channing and Weinberg formed a separate venture-capital partnership, C.W. Group, that specialized in new medical technology.[20] At the time it was the largest venture-capital fund devoted exclusively to investments in health-care companies.[21]<br>
<br>
Channing was a director of many of the companies launched by his firm, including GMIS Inc., VelQuest Corporation, Plexxikon, and Care Advantage.[22] <span style="color:#FF0040">He also served on the board of <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Outward Bound</span></span>.[23]<br>

Channing was a member of the Venture Advisory Committee of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard Chan Research Center on Causes and Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health</span>.<br>
<br>
Personal Life<br>
Channing was married to Molly Seagrave Channing from 1990 until his death in 2015. The couple raised four daughters: Francesca Channing-Secco, Isabella Channing-Secco, Sylvia Channing, and Cornelia “Nina” Channing.<br>
<br>
In 1963, while an undergraduate at Harvard, Channing married a young aspiring actress named Susan Stockard, then a student at Radcliffe College.[25] The two divorced in 1967, but Stockard kept the surname, eventually dropping her first name and going simply by <span style="color:#FF0040">Stockard Channing</span>.[26] His second wife, Rosina Secco, was a Uruguayan graphic designer.

<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Name a person who wouldn’t like to find true love and a soul mate? Lorraine Silvetz nee Cancro and her new husband, Dr. Robert Silvetz are among the lucky ones who’ve done just that..her uncle, Robert Cancro, M.D. and their spokesperson, three-time Emmy Award-winning anchor and best-selling author, Rita Cosby — was to find ways of treating Post Traumatic Stress Disorder without medication.<br>
<br>
Through the years they found many interventions to help alleviate the symptoms of PTSD but not until 2013 did she find the ultimate intervention, discovered by the Brain Treatment Center (BTC) in California. Her colleague, Eilhys England Hackworth co-Founder with the late Colonel David Hackworth of Stand for the Troops (SFTT), knew about the organization and introduced her to it last year...<br>
<br>
When she flew to Newport Beach to investigate the successes of the BTC, something life changing occurred. Not only did she find the non-pharmacologic intervention she was looking for, but she also found the man of her dreams, Chief Scientific Officer of the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Brain Treatment Center, Robert D. Silvetz, M.D</span>. It was a swift courtship. Within twenty-four hours of their first date, December 7th, they were discussing marriage, and they were engaged in less than a month....<br>
<br>
Colleagues and friends who attended the wedding came from as far as Italy and Taiwan. Dr. Yi Jin, Founder of the Brain Treatment Center along with his entire team were present for the couple’s special day including BTC C.E.O. Conway Ho. Scientists present included Robert Cancro, M.D., Chairman Emeritus of N.Y.U.’s Department of Psychiatry; Robert Isenhart, Ph.D.; Leslie Prichep, Ph.D.; Judy Kuriansky, Ph.D.; Ralph DePalo, Ph.D.; Carol Cancro, M.D.; Charlie Knezevich, Ph.D.; Michael O’Hagan, Ph.D., among others including the groom’s father, Robert M. Silvetz, M.D...<br>
<br>
For those familiar with the mental health field, the attendees represent a who’s who of the New York establishment. Always seeking the forefront of knowledge, Lorraine brought them into contact with the Brain Treatment Center. The BTC is a unique combination of engineers, physicists and doctors. Under the leadership of Dr. Jin, two novel therapies are now entering clinical trial. One therapy targets PTSD, the other therapy targets autism. Both therapies have great potential to alleviate the extreme suffering imposed by PTSD or autism and restore considerable quality of life to millions of patients. New York will lead the way again in implementing these therapies once the clinical trials are completed...<br>
<br>
The BTC recently treated over sixty veterans with severe PTSD free of charge. Many of these veterans also had other comorbidities, from traumatic brain injuries to substance abuse, that complicated their PTSD condition. In an unprecedented outcome, each of the veterans improved dramatically from their PTSD...<br>
<br>
Business people and entrepreneurs from around the world attended the wedding including J.J. Han, International Business Director of BTC; Kevin McGovern, Chairman of the Water Initiative; <span style="color:#FF0040">John Silvetz of Blue Crest Capital Management, LLP</span>; Jeffrey Loewy, President of Tirschwell and Loewy, Inc.; Larry Cancro, Senior V.P. of Fenway Affairs at the Boston Red Sox; Barry Klarberg, Founder and C.E.O. of Monarch Business and Wealth Management; Managing Partners of Dragon Deeds Capital, Eilhys England Hackworth and Keith Buckler; C.E.O. of Brain Treatment Center (BTC), Conway Ho; and Richard Anthony of BGC Partners, among others.<br>
<br>
TV personalities and entertainers including the wonderful Rita Cosby; singer, songwriter, producer Tomaczek Bednarek; and newcomer/singer, Cheyenne Elliott. Writers included Synesthesia expert and author, Maureen Seaberg and award-winning March of Dimes blogger, Barbara Cancro Carr, therapist/writer Nan O’Brien; and philanthropists Eilhys England Hackworth, Sara Herbert Galloway, Errol Rappaport, Barbara and David Bender, Roberta Lowenstein, Terry Watkins, NancyJane Loewy, myself, and many more...<br>
<br>
The reception at Oheka Castle dazzled the guests. Oheka Castle was part of the inspiration for F. Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby and it is the second largest private home in the U.S., with 127 rooms and over 109,000 square feet.<br>
<br>
Guests danced that evening to the ten-piece band, Billy and the Showmen. They were entertained by soon-to-be-launched singer, Cheyenne Elliott, granddaughter of Dionne Warwick and cousin of Whitney Houston, who sang a rendition of At Last. In addition, Tomaczek Bednarek created and performed a beautiful guitar solo in honor of the new couple. The Silvetzes left the next day for their honeymoon cruise to New England and Canada.<br>
<br>
Friends and family in attendance included Fabrizio D’Allessio, Cristina Silvetz, the newly wedded couple, <span style="color:#FF0040">John Silvetz, and Deon Silvetz.</span> <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/kxr2ns.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></div></blockquote>

KELLY LE BROCK<br>
<br>
Kelly Le Brock, an iconic star of the '80s, was beloved on a global scale not only for her role in the films Weird Science(1985) and Woman in Red(1984), but also for her unforgettable spreads in Vogue magazine and famous “Don't hate me because I'm beautiful” line from Pantene commercials. Though for a time Kelly escaped the spotlight to find a healthier lifestyle and raise her family away from the strains of fame, she has now returned with a different agenda, to fight for a more equitable and healthy society. </div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">Four Seasons Landscaping is less than 3 kilometers away from the notorious Holmesburg prison, now closed, where a Jewish dermatologist, Dr Albert Kligman (1916-2010), conducted horrific medical experiments on the bodies of live prisoners for many years, America's own 'Josef Mengele'.<br>
<a href="https://rielpolitik.com/2019/05/15/cover-up-holmesburg-prison-a-true-story-of-abuse-and-exploitation-in-the-name-of-medical-science-by-allen-m-hornblum/" class="postlink">https://rielpolitik.com/2019/05/15/cove ... -hornblum/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Experimental research at Holmesburg Prison was run by Dr. Albert Kligman.<br>
&gt;Albert Montgomery Kligman was born in Philadelphia on March 17, 1916, the son of Jewish immigrants.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmesburg_Prison#Experiments_on_inmates" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmesbur ... on_inmates</a><br>

<br>
<br>
many cases, inmates chose to undergo several inhumane trials for the sake of small monetary rewards. The prison was viewed as a human laboratory. It was an "idle collection of humanity that seemed ideal for dermatologic study,"Dr. Albert Kligman famously recounted entering the Holmesburg Prison for the first time as, "All I saw before me were acres of skin. It was like a farmer seeing a fertile field for the first time.<br>

<br>
His father, born in Ukraine, was a newspaper distributor; his mother, born in England, was a sales clerk. As a child, he was a Boy Scout, developing a love of plants on scouting trips to the countryside.<br>
<br>
<br>
From 1964 to 1968, the U.S. Army paid $386,486 to professors Albert Kligman and Herbert W. Copelan to perform experiments with mind-altering drugs on 320 inmates of Holmesburg Prison. The goal of the study was to determine the minimum effective dose of each drug needed to disable 50 percent of any given population. Kligman and Copelan initially claimed that they were unaware of any long-term health effects the drugs could have on prisoners; however, documents later revealed that this was not the case.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Led by Dr. Albert M. Kligman of the University of Pennsylvania, the studies were performed on behalf of Dow Chemical Company, the U.S. Army, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. In one of the studies, for which Dow Chemical paid Kligman $10,000, Kligman injected dioxin — a highly toxic, carcinogenic compound found in Agent Orange, which Dow was manufacturing for use in Vietnam at the time — into 70 prisoners (most of them black). The prisoners developed severe lesions which went untreated for seven months.Dow Chemical wanted to study the health effects of dioxin and other herbicides, and how they affect human skin, because workers at their chemical plants were developing chloracne. In the study, Kligman applied roughly the same amount of dioxin as that to which Dow employees were being exposed. In 1980 and 1981, some of the people who were used in this study sued Professor Kligman for a variety of health problems, including lupus and psychological damage.<br>
