Worcester George Floyd Store A Coincidence Amid Tragedy <a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/worcester/worcester-store-named-george-floyd-coincidence-amid-tragedy" class="postlink">https://patch.com/massachusetts/worcest ... id-tragedy</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>WORCESTER, MA — There's a store in Worcester that shares a name with George Floyd, who died May 25 after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. The name crossover is a strange coincidence amid a national uprising over police brutality — and the man who founded the store sees important parallels between recent protests and the country he emigrated from.<br>
<br>
The founding of the George Floyd Mini Mart along Millbury Street in Worcester can be traced back to northern Syria in the mid-1990s. George Kentar was deeply into music and would visit a store called Floyd Cassettes to buy albums. He liked the word "Floyd" and asked the owner where the word came from. That's how he found out about a band called Pink Floyd.<br>
<br>
Soon after, Kentar opened his own convenience store in a room off of an apartment he was renting in the Syrian city of Qamishli. He named the store George Floyd, a combination of his first name and the band he loved. He worked full-time selling ice cream and cigarettes to locals and devoted a lot of time to playing music in local bands.<br>
<br>
In 2002, Kentar and his band was invited to play in the <span style="color:#FF0080">Smithsonian Folklife Festival </span>in Washington. It was his first trip to the United States.<br>
<br>
..At the time, Kentar had a lot of family living in Worcester. His uncle came here in the 1970s to go to school, and family members have been coming ever since. Kentar came back to the U.S. in 2003 and joined his family in Worcester.<br>
<br>
Kentar didn't speak much English at first and worked more than full-time at a convenience store and as an electrician. He remembers being welcomed by local residents. In particular, one woman, a regular at the Sunny Farms he worked at in Quinsigamond Village, pledged to help him learn two new English words every day...<br>
<br>
He worked 80 hours a week and didn't make much money. He was constantly stressed out over theft; thieves took <span style="color:#FF0040">$4,000 </span>worth of cigarettes in a nighttime burglary.<br>
<br>
"I put<span style="color:#FF0040"> my blood into the store</span>," he said.<br>
<br>
He sold it in 2017, and the new owner hasn't changed the name. Kentar now owns Papa George's Pizza along June Street. He still works 80 hours a week, but he's confident it will get easier (the name of the pizza shop is another coincidence — Kentar says he didn't go seeking another business bearing his name).<br>
<br>
...The protests worry him. In 2011, the Arab Spring either toppled or attempted to dethrone autocratic leaders from Morocco to Yemen. The Syrian Armed Forces met the uprising in that country against President Bashar al-Assad with brutal violence. Close to <span style="color:#FF0040">400,000 have died</span>, and the civil war is still going on.</div></blockquote>

DISGUSTING Place. Rude staff, slow service, cold food. Workers have been seen dumping strange liquids from large containers outside. Loud, drunk patrons fighting in the street, they URINATE AND DEFECATE IN THE STREET, and throw trash everywhere. Parking nightmare - your car will be towed. POLICE HAVE BEEN CALLED SEVERAL TIMES. Drug Selling in the street. Disgrace to Ghanaian culture and reputation. This place should be condemned. RUN from Anokye Krom!

In 2009 Harvard showed up : Ghanaian community serves as language lab <a href="https://archive.is/FJB9i" class="postlink">https://archive.is/FJB9i</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>By Aaron Nicodemus TELEGRAM &amp; GAZETTE STAFF<br>
<br>
Six college students seeking the sounds of Ghana came to Worcester today, home of a well-established community from the West African nation. The college students are learning the Asante Twi language spoken in Ghana as part of their undergraduate education. Today, they had lunch at the Anokye Kron restaurant on Millbury Street and visited a Twi-language radio station in the city and some shops selling wares from Ghana.<br>
<br>
The students came at the suggestion of their teacher, Prince M. Obiri-Mainoo, a Ghanaian native who has lived in Worcester for five years. He said they would like to end their course by going to Ghana itself...The students, five from Harvard University and one from MIT, say their reasons for learning Twi are varied...<br>
<br>
“You can learn those (other) languages at almost any university,” said Sumorwuo Zaza, a Harvard junior studying government and economics. “I would regret not taking a language I couldn’t take anywhere else.”<br>
<br>
Sarah K. Peprah, a Harvard freshman, said her Ghanaian-born parents spoke Twi in their home.....Kwami Williams, a sophomore aeronautical engineering major at MIT, was born in Ghana...<br>
<br>
Worcester’s Ghanaian population is estimated at several thousand, with several thousand more residing elsewhere in Worcester County. Serving that population are several Ghanaian churches and social clubs, as well as restaurants and shops. An FM radio station, WORD 102.9, knits the Twi-speaking community together with its 24-hours-a-day of programming

<br>
For <span style="color:#FF0040">ten days</span> in the summer of 2002, the great geographical and cultural distance that lies between<br>
the heart of Europe and the far reaches of Asia was reduced to the length of a leisurely afternoon<br>
stroll on the National Mall. For the first time in its 36-year history, the Smithsonian Folklife Festival<br>
had a single - and remarkably ambitious - theme: the Silk Road. The name denotes the network of<br>
trade routes, over both land and sea, along which merchants and travelers began to move across<br>
Asia and Europe from the first millennium B.C.E. The most famous east-west component of the Silk<br>
Road began in Xi'an, the ancient capital of China, broke north and south of China's Takla Makan<br>
Desert, and traversed a vast stretch of Central and Western Asia on its way to the eastern end of the<br>
Mediterranean...<br>

A lot of interesting names on that Smithsonian document, like.. Folkways Advisory Board, Michael Asch<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Asch" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Asch</a> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Moses Asch (December 2, 1905 – October 19, 1986), often known as Moe Asch, was a Polish-American recording engineer and record executive. He founded Asch Records, which then changed its name to Folkways Records when the label transitioned from 78 RPM recordings to LP records.. the son of Yiddish language novelist and dramatist Sholem Asch... son, Michael Asch..

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Folkways" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Folkways</a><br>
<br>
In 1905, Moses "Moe" Asch was born in Poland. His father, Sholem Asch, a successful author, made enough money to move the family to Paris in 1912. In 1914, Sholem left Paris for work in New York City and, a year later, sent for his family...In the mid-1920s, Asch studied radio engineering in Germany, a center for the new science. When he returned to the United States, he worked for various electronic firms before opening his own radio repair business, Radio Labs, during the Great Depression. In this business, Moe built equipment for radio stations and installed recorders for air use...<br>
<br>
In 1940, Sholem invited his son with him to New Jersey to meet <span style="color:#FF0040">physicist and humanitarian Albert Einstein</span>, who encouraged Moe to record and document the sounds of the world, which Asch took to be his life calling. Soon after that meeting, in early 1940, Asch founded Asch Records with a small staff and studio located in downtown Manhattan, New York.

With the suicide (or murder, according to some) of Gary's friend folksinger Phil Ochs and the death of his mentor, Folkways Records owner Moe Asch, Gary Green left the music world. However before his departure there were several Gary-esque adventures that shaped his music. While still recording and touring for Folkways Records and acting as associate editor for three issues of Broadside Magazine, Gary also co-produced three albums for Folkways and Broadside (including Phil Ochs Sings For Broadside Volume 2, a compilation of New York street musicians called Streetsounds, and the now-infamous album Bob Dylan vs. A.J.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pirate radio ordered to stop <a href="https://archive.is/qLqC9" class="postlink">https://archive.is/qLqC9</a><br>
<br>
Posted Apr 24, 2010 <br>
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission has issued a second cease-and-desist order against a pirate FM radio station, which also is receiving criticism from a Main South neighborhood activist for promoting after-hours parties.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Flava 105.5, a reggae and hip hop statio</span>n in business for about two years, was notified by the FCC on April 15 that it does not have an FCC-issued radio license and should immediately shut down its operations. The notice was sent to station manager Leroy Simon Jr. at the station’s office, located in an office building at 18 Grafton St. The FCC had sent a similar notice to Flava 105.5 a year ago, when the station’s transmitter was located in a private home at 4 Camassa Terrace in Worcester.<br>
<br>
“We’re no longer on the air,” said Mr. Simon, when contacted for this story. “We’re not in business.”<br>
<br>
When asked how the radio station could be out of business when it was on the air on Thursday, and its website was still active, Mr. Simon replied, “I only run the Internet business. The website is up.”<br>
<br>
He refused to answer additional questions. The station was still operating as of last night.<br>
<br>
Flava 105.5 generally operated every day starting about 5 p.m., although music could be heard 24 hours a day on its website, <a href="http://www.flava105.com" class="postlink">www.flava105.com</a>. Its radio signal could be heard in all of Worcester and parts of some adjacent suburbs. With local disc jokeys, the station played reggae, hip hop, soul calypso and other types of Caribbean music.<br>
<br>
The FCC served two other cease-and-desist orders to local unlicensed radio stations this month, according to the commission’s records. On April 12, the FCC issued a cease-and- desist order to <span style="color:#FF0040">The Word 102.9, a Ghanaian station operated by Kwaku Boateng</span> at 97 Webster St. in Worcester. The station was not broadcasting yesterday and no one answered its phone. The station’s website, <a href="http://www.wordonlineradio.com" class="postlink">www.wordonlineradio.com</a>, was still working yesterday, and local Twi-language talk was available at a click.<br>
<br>
On April 8, the FCC ordered Jose Zavala to cease and desist operating an unlicensed radio station at 102.7, with a transmitter located at 190 High St. in Webster. Attempts to contact Mr. Zavala were unsuccessful....Pirate radio stations are not unique to Worcester. Just this year, the FCC has issued cease-and-desist orders against unlicensed radio stations in Brockton, Fall River, Norwood, Boston, Providence and Pawtucket, R.I., Hartford, Meridian and New Britain, Conn., as well as dozens of other stations across the country.<br>
<br>
William T. Breault, chairman of the Main South Alliance for Public Safety, said he blew the whistle on Flava 105.5 with the FCC last year, and complained to the federal agency again this year. Mr. Breault said he has nothing against the radio station’s music, but that he opposes shows and after-hours parties that the radio station has promoted in the Main South neighborhood. “They can play whatever they want,” he said. “But they’ve been sending out slick fliers for shows in my neighborhood, and promoting the shows on the air. Those shows have caused all kinds of problems.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Breault said the radio station regularly promotes shows at a restaurant on Canterbury Street, which has a large function hall in the rear of the building. As of Friday, the radio station’s website was promoting two events at the site. The radio station also was promoting a show at Club Venue on Main Street, as well as a hip hop concert in Miami. Worcester Police Lt. James Johnson, the department’s liaison to the city Licensing Commission, said that he had seen Flava 105.5 signs at some shows that had <span style="color:#FF0040">problems with underage drinking</span> and that were serving alcohol after they were supposed to have closed.<br>
<br>
“We had some problems with shows on Park Avenue and on Stafford Street about a year ago,” he said. “They have apparently been doing some promotions for after-hours parties.”<br>
<br>
Lt. Johnson said he did not know of any connection between Flava 105.5 and problems at the Canterbury Street restaurant, although he did note that police have been called there seven times since January....</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>WORCESTER -- Bradford Wyatt, owner of Wyatt Development LLC., the current owner of the Osgood Bradley building at 18 Grafton St., is in the midst of cleaning out the 101-year-old building as part of a sale agreement...Pennsylvania company Vision Development plans on turning the former manufacturing building into student apartments.<br>
<br>
Wyatt's partnership bought the building in 2007, with the intention of redeveloping it as a motel. Those plans never materialized, and several spots in the building have been leased to tenants over the ensuing years, as redevelopment was further explored.<br>
<br>
One such <span style="color:#FF0040">tenant was Flava 105.5</span>, a radio station specializing in reggae and hip hop. While the station broadcast for at least two years out of Osgood Bradley and drew local politicians to its airwaves it was not licensed. Wyatt wasn't aware of that last fact until a day in April 2010 when a representative from the Federal Communications Commission showed up, demanding to see where the wire from the station's roof antennae led...<br>
<br>
On that day, the property manager was not working, so Wyatt was reached in his office. Wyatt said he gave the FCC access to the building. The wire led to the sixth floor, and to a locked studio...As owner of the property, Wyatt said he received a written notice from the FCC as well, but that he has since destroyed the document as part of the building's cleanup.<br>
<br>
The radio station stayed several months more, Wyatt said. Wyatt said he was told the station was only broadcasting over the Internet. Even though Wyatt knew the station was still operating during the day, the transmitter was not located at 18 Grafton St., Wyatt said.</div></blockquote>

A not very flattering article of the place .. Brightside of the Moon, it wasn't. More like darkspot on Earth. <a href="http://kendraedmonds4.blogspot.com/2013/12/brightside-of-moon-it-wasnt-more-like.html" class="postlink">http://kendraedmonds4.blogspot.com/2013 ... -like.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...This place wasn't new when I got here. By 1984 it had been in existence for 103 years. Farmland before Mother Mary (can you believe that one) and the Sisters of Providence took up residence up on the big hill (see the gold dome behind the tree on the right, that's the big house). The original mission of the Sisters was to minister to the hundreds of poor immigrants and mill workers living in Holyoke, and that they set about doing...  In 1892, Bishop Beaven acquired this farm, and that is how Brightside was born.<br>
<br>
Next door to the big house on the hill was the Wilkinson Farm, which was nicknamed "Brightside" because of the blessing of the morning sun. Honestly, I worked the morning shift, which began at 6a.m. and I can not remember nary a morning sun. I think I learned early on to never enjoy the gifts of nature or humankind while I was a Brightside, because I really was at a darkspot on Earth...</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Contact: Stephen Lundrigan</div></blockquote>

He's also a youth counsellor and a priest : Journey to Priesthood: Father Lundrigan takes long road <a href="https://catholicfreepress.org/news/father-lundrigan-takes-long-journey-to-priesthood" class="postlink">https://catholicfreepress.org/news/fath ... priesthood</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Father Stephen  E. Lundrigan said he knew when he was a youngster that he wanted to be a priest.<br>
He just didn’t know that God’s plan for that to happen would take quite a bit longer that he first thought it would.<br>
<br>
He graduated in 1990 with a bachelor’s degree in psychology.<br>
His first job after college was in Worcester, working as a counselor with troubled and problem young people. He worked in a juvenile detention center run by the KEY Program Inc., for the Department of Youth Services. Later, he said, he worked for the DYS in outreach programs for troubled youth. He also studied part time at night at Assumption College and, in 1994, received a master’s degree in counseling psychology.<br>
He then became a clinician in Life Resources Alpha Omega a residential program in Littleton run by Catholic Charities in the  Archdiocese of Boston.<br>
<br>
In 1997 he went back to Manchester, entered St. Anselm Abbey and became a Benedictine monk. He studied pre-theology and two years of theology.<br>
He had taken temporary vows and had undergone a process of discernment while at the abbey. When it came time to decide whether to take permanent vows, he said, he felt that God’s plan was for him not to take them at that time. His temporary vows expired in 2001. He finished the academic year, then left the abbey and returned to Worcester.<br>
“I thought I’d be back soon, either in another religious order or the diocesan priesthood,” he said.<br>
<br>
Back in his apartment in Worcester he began searching out various religious orders on his “brand new computer,” he said. He had his state counseling license, and a friend, who was director of outpatient services  at Adcare Hospital, told him about an opening for a counselor’s position there. At Adcare he worked mostly with adult patients but, because of his past experience, also with some adolescents. He said he still thought he would go back into a religious order in a year.<br>
“But once again, God had other plans,” he said.<br>
In 2002 he became the clinical director at a DYS secure treatment unit in Westborough.<br>
“Then one thing led to another and another,” he said.<br>
<br>
He began to teach part-time at Worcester State University in addition to his DYS work. Eventually he opened a private counseling practice. He rented an office on Grove Street and saw patients while he still was with DYS. By 2004 that private practice had grown into a full-time job. He said his mother was his office manager for eight years.<br>
He started a non-profit organization called Unlocking Potentials for Growth, which provided housing and services for homeless young adults.<br>
<br>
During this time he still was thinking about the priesthood. He said he also, at times, thought about getting married and raising a family. But, he said, his thoughts always went back to the priesthood.<br>
“God was gently tugging, tugging, tugging,” he said.<br>
He said he stayed in touch with Father James S. Mazzone, director of the diocesan Office for Vocations.<br>
He began to phase out his business, not an easy thing to do when you have rent and debts you must take care of, he said. He cut the private practice back to part time and simultaneously worked for the Spencer/East Brookfield School District as therapeutic intervention specialist. Later he was program director at a substance abuse residential program in Ashby.<br>
<br>
When he left St. Anselm Abbey in 2001, he thought he would be back within a year. Twelve years later, in 2013, he entered St. John Seminary, Brighton, to complete his studies for the priesthood. He was ordained a priest June 20 by Bishop McManus in <span style="color:#FF0040">St. Paul Cathedral</span>.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>April 17, 2021<br>
At right, after crossing the Rio Grande from Mexico into the United States to seek asylum, a 4-year-old migrant child sleeps on the ground by his mother while they wait to be transported by Border Patrol in La Joya, Texas, April 8.<br>
<br>
Father Stephen E. Lundrigan, pastor at Annunciation Parish in Gardner, knows firsthand about the U.S.-Mexican border crisis because two years ago he volunteered at a diocesan processing center for migrants at the border in Brownsville, Texas.<br>
Some Americans believe the U.S. should close the border and some think migrants should be allowed to enter the country to enjoy a better life...<br>
<br>
Father Lundrigan was among four priests from the Worcester Diocese who visited Brownsville, Texas, Jan. 30- Feb. 1, 2019. He worked with the Brownsville diocesan processing center that fed, clothed and relocated immigrants who U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  released from detention centers because they had relatives in the country...<br>
<br>
That processing center in Brownsville was located in a former nursing home, but has since closed due to complaints from local residents, Father Lundrigan said.<br>
He also worked at a center on the Mexican side of the border that housed immigrants who were trying to cross the border. It was surrounded by a wall and wire, and was guarded to keep the migrants safe.</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Roman Catholic Church in the New England region of the United States. The geographic boundaries of the diocese are the same as those of Worcester County, Massachusetts, the geographically largest county of the state of Massachusetts. It is headed by a bishop who has his see at the Cathedral of Saint Paul in the city of Worcester. The fifth and current bishop is Robert Joseph McManus.<br>
<br>
Pope Pius XII erected the Diocese of Worcester on 7 March 1950, taking its present territory, that of Worcester County, from the Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts and making it a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Boston. He designated the Church of St. Paul as the cathedral of the new diocese.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">Sexual abuse</span><br>
On August 31, 1997, a letter which former Worcester Bishop Bernard J. Flanagan sent to the Rev. Jerome Hayden, a Catholic therapist in Holliston, Massachusetts, in 1968 was made public.[1] In his letter, Flanagan stated that Fr. David A. Holley "has been ... [accused of] molesting teenage boys on at least two occasions—most recently in a hospital from which he has been barred—and with carrying around and showing to these boys pornographic magazines and books. Although the ... [accusations] were established beyond any doubt in the judgment of the priests who assisted me in the investigation as well as myself, Father has denied any wrongdoing."[1] More letters which were obtained by the Dallas Morning News revealed that Holley was transferred to the Seton Institute in Baltimore in 1970 after more accusations against him surfaced.[1] In May 2020, it was revealed that the Diocese of Worcester was named in a lawsuit involving a plaintiff whom Holley allegedly abused in the 1970s.[2][3] The lawsuit, which also named the Dioceses where Holley was transferred to as defendants, faulted the Diocese of Worcester with the "most of the blame."[3] Holley was later convicted of sexual abuse in New Mexico in 1993 and given a prison sentence of 55 to 275 years</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Four diocesan priests spent three days on the U.S.-Mexican border recently to observe the ministries of the Catholic Church that serve migrants on both sides of the border.<br>
Taking part were Father Peter J. Joyce, pastor of St. Mary of the Assumption Parish, Milford; Father William E. Champlin, pastor of St. Leo Parish, Leominster; Father Stephen E. Lundrigan, pastor of Annunciation Parish, Gardner, and Father Hugo A. Cano, chaplain at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Father James Manship, of the Archdiocese of Hartford, also was part of the group.<br>
<br>
They arrived at the border near Brownsville, Texas, Jan. 30 and returned Feb. 1. The trip was under the auspices of the Catholic Extension’s Mission Immersion Program for Pastors. Father Joyce said the trip was a way to give them an awareness of the Church’s work with the poor.<br>
According to Tim Muldoon, director of Mission Education at Catholic Extension, the trip was funded by Lilly Endowment Inc. through its Thriving in Ministry initiative to give pastors the opportunity to understand the realities in poor parts of the United States...<br>
<br>
The group visited the Humanitarian Respite Center, operated by <span style="color:#FF0040">Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley</span> for immigrants seeking asylum who have been allowed to stay in the U.S. to connect with relatives already here. ..<br>
<br>
Sister Norma Pimentel, director of the center, is called the Mother Teresa of the border, Father Cano said..<br>
<br>
The group also visited the Inn of Providence (La Posada Providencia) run by the Sisters of Divine Providence since 1989. Immigrants stay there while waiting asylum court proceedings, Mr. Muldoon wrote.They also visited a medical clinic and shelter run by the Vincentian Sisters in Reynosa, Mexico, for immigrants  who were turned away from the border and can’t go back to the countries they  left.<br>
On the final day the group visited the Human Development Project (Proyecto Desarollo Humano). It is a ministry of the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Father Joyce said that it is an agricultural area where people have settled. He said the sisters helped create the community with a health clinic and assistance to the residents.<br>

Trump did it in front of the St. John’s Episcopal Church.. there was a fire in the basement nursery room, either in the church itself or in Ashburton House next door, conflicting news reports make it unclear which.

Vernon Hill : "My best investment was spending the summer of 1968 driving round America with <span style="color:#FF0040">Ray Kroc — the man who had bought McDonald’s for $2.7 million and would turn it into a multimillion-dollar business</span> — helping him find sites for his business." <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/my-best-investment-vernon-hill-btrn3hkrsxc" class="postlink">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/my-b ... trn3hkrsxc</a><br>
<br>
Ray Kroc was also involved with slaughterhouses or as this article puts it: AN ASSEMBLY LINE OF INNOVATIONS <a href="https://www.destination-innovation.com/tag/slaughterhouse/" class="postlink">https://www.destination-innovation.com/ ... hterhouse/</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Henry Ford (1863 – 1947) is often credited with the innovation of the assembly line in mass manufacturing and he was the first to use it in automobile manufacture. However, Ford got the idea from an abattoir. A Ford executive, William Klann, was impressed with the efficiency of the Swift slaughterhouse in Chicago where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor.   In 1913 at the age of 50 Ford introduced the assembly line process into his car factory and productivity improved eight-fold. Soon it became common practice in factories around the world.<br>
<br>
Ray Kroc (1902 – 1984) adopted the idea and applied it to the restaurant business when he ran the McDonald’s chain. In 1961, at the age of 58, he bought the McDonald brothers restaurant business for $2.7m. He applied the assembly line principle to hamburger preparation and transformed productivity and speed of service in restaurants.<br>
<br>
An Indian ophthalmologist, <span style="color:#FF0040">Dr Govindappa Venkataswamy (1918 – 2006), admired the McDonald’s approach and decided to try a similar method for the treatment of cataracts in India</span>. At the age of 58 and despite being crippled with rheumatoid arthritis, he founded the Aravind Eye Hospital at Madurai in India. He trained paramedics to do 70% of the work required in each surgery freeing up doctors to perform the more demanding tasks. He brought assembly line thinking to the process and reduced the cost of each cataract operation to around $10 (compared to say $1600 in the USA). Each surgeon carries out some 2600 operations a year (compared to 250 in most other hospitals and countries). Seventy % of the operations are performed at no charge to the patients.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Govindappa Venkataswamy (1 October 1918 – 7 July 2006) popularly known as 'Dr V.' was an Indian ophthalmologist who dedicated his life to eliminate needless blindness. He was the founder and former chairman of Aravind Eye Hospitals...Over 50% of the organisation's patients pay either nothing or highly subsidised rates.[2] Its scale and self-sustainability prompted a 1993 Harvard Business Case Study on the Aravind model.<br>
<br>
In 1992, Venkataswamy and partners of Aravind founded Aurolab,[6] an internationally certified manufacturing facility that brought the price of the intraocular lens down to one-tenth of international prices, making it affordable for developing countries...<br>
<br>
 In 1965, at a conference on rehabilitation for the blind, Venkataswamy met Sir John Wilson, founder of the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind (later known as <span style="color:#FF0040">Sightsavers International</span>). ..Venkataswamy. credits Sir John Wilson's mentorship for helping him develop a global view on blindness prevention.

The hippie movement of the 1960s, which began in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles and peculiar military and political ties to prominent figures in the scene like Jim Morrison and Frank Zappa are looked at with Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon author Dave McGowan.

<br>
Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon<br>
How did an uncanny amount of rock superstars emerge from the rustic Laurel Canyon scene of the mid 60s when the primary music centers of the US at that time were NYC, Nashville, and Detroit? Why were many of these future stars sons and daughters of the military/intelligence complex and extreme privilege who just happened to all arrive in LA at the same time? From the Lizard King Jim Morrison to Frank Zappa, the Mamas and Papas, the Byrds, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, even the Monkees, they all had conspicuous family heritages that did not exactly jive with what would become the free love, anti war soundtrack of a generation. Meanwhile, looming behind these musicians was a dark underbelly of Hollywood stars, young turks, the mob, shadowy intelligence assets, and charmers like little Charlie Manson who everyone liked at first.. How and why did this all happen? And what about that covert military installation on Lookout Mountain?</div></blockquote>

McGowan talks about the early folk music bands of the Sixties emerging from Laurel Canyon.  This dovetails with Smithsonian Folkways : ...<em class="text-italics">In 1940, Sholem Asch invited his son with him to New Jersey to meet physicist and humanitarian Albert Einstein, who encouraged Moe to record and document the sounds of the world, which Asch took to be his life calling. Soon after that meeting, in early 1940, Asch founded Asch Records.</em><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In the summer of 1926, an experimental beam of light pierced the night sky between two precisely measured peaks in the San Gabriel Mountains, and science history was made. Virtually unseen by the major population centers below, the beam was the key element of Dr. Albert A. Michelson’s revolutionary experiments to accurately measure the speed of light...<br>
<br>
The measuring stations were set up on Mount Wilson, above Pasadena, and on “Lookout Mountain,” a nondescript peak located 3.2 miles southwest of Mount San Antonio (aka Mount Baldy) summit, above Upland. Mount Wilson had been used as an observatory site as early as 1889, and the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory was built on the summit in 1904. Numerous astronomical facilities were built on the 5,715 foot peak, and Mount Wilson became a gathering place for famous astronomers and scientists...<br>
<br>
Lookout Mountain got its name in 1915, when a fire lookout tower was constructed there. The 6,812 foot peak was originally called “Baldy Lookout,” and it was labeled that way on early forest service maps. The remote tower was only accessible by a steep footpath, and it was connected to the Ontario-Upland telephone exchange so that observers manning the lookout could immediately report fires. Michelson generally referred to the Lookout Mountain site as “San Antonio Mountain,” even though this designation was technically incorrect.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Albert Einstein made his second trip to the United States in the period between December 1930 and March 1931 to spend some time at California Institute of Technology, one of the institutions that was courting him to join their staff. It was on the return trip across the U.S. by train that the above photograph was taken.<br>
<br>
There are several striking things about this photograph that deserve mention. It is clear that the headdress that has been placed on Professor Einstein's head and the pipe he has been given to hold have no relationship to the Indians in this photograph. These Indians are Hopis from the relatively nearby Hopi pueblos while the headdress and pipe belong to the Plains Indian culture. The actual location of the photograph is Hopi House, a part of the Fred Harvey concession at the Grand Canyon. The studio that took the photograph was associated with the El Tovar Hotel, at the Grand Canyon. The two buildings sat side by side with Hopi House, designed by Mary Colter, being used for the display and sales of Native American crafts. Many of the crafts people hired by the Fred Harvey Company, such as Nampeyo and Fred Kabotie, are among the most highly regarded Native American artists of their generation. The Hopis in this picture were employees of the Fred Harvey Company who demonstrated their arts there and, no doubt, posed for many other pictures with tourists.<br>
<br>
Besides Albert Einstein and his wife, there are 3 adult Hopis and one Hopi child in the photograph. Einstein is holding the hand of a young Hopi girl in a very natural manner; she is clutching something tightly in her other hand and is quite intent upon something outside the frame. Prof. Einstein's attraction to children is seen in several other unofficial photographs. He loved children and felt quite comfortable with them. The two men on the left side of the photograph were there to facilitate the Einstein's trip. The man on the left is J. B. Duffy, General Passenger Agent of the ATSF (the famous Atichson, Tokepa and Santa Fe Railroad); the other man is Herman Schweizer, Head of Fred Harvey Curio, normally stationed in Albuquerque. He may have spoken German and was therefore present because Prof. Einstein was not completely comfortable yet with English.<br>
<br>
None of the Einstein biographers that have mentioned this photograph have the location correct. Most place it at "the Hopi Reservation at the Grand Canyon." In fact, the Hopi Reservation lies approximately 100 miles east of the site of this photograph. One biographer says that Einstein was embarrassed by being given the name "The Great Relative". Another claimed that he was smirking in the photograph. (We have examined a large scale poster of the photograph in great detail and find that no such statement can be made since his mouth is in full shadow!)</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">&lt;... Albert Abraham Michelson [check out that Hidden Hand]...&gt;<br>
<br>
Michelson, Albert Abraham (1852-1931) – Born in Prussia, Albert Michelson moved with his parents to North America where he became a pioneering physicist and, in 1882, successfully measured the speed of light. For this, and other work in optical instrumentation, in 1907 he became the first American scientist to win a Nobel Prize. Michelson attended <span style="color:#FF0040">Washington Lodge No. 21 in New York City</span>. <a href="http://www.lodgestpatrick.co.nz/famous2.php" class="postlink">http://www.lodgestpatrick.co.nz/famous2.php</a><br>
<br>
Grand Lodge of New York <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Lodge_of_New_York" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Lodge_of_New_York</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Grand Lodge of New York (officially, the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York) is the largest and oldest independent organization of Freemasons in the U.S. state of New York.[1][2] It was at one time the largest grand lodge in the world in terms of membership.[citation needed]<br>
<br>
The Grand Lodge is over 230 years old, having been founded December 15, 1782. Grand Lodge of New York acts as the coordinating body for many functions undertaken throughout the state. Its various committees organize <span style="color:#FF0040">blood drives, the New York Masonic Safety Identification Program</span> and various charitable events around New York...<br>
<br>
It is not known when the first Freemason set foot in the American colony of New York, but the first documented presence dates from the mid-1730s, when Daniel Coxe, Jr. (1673–1739), was appointed by the Duke of Norfolk, the Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England (known to historians as the "Moderns"), to act as a Provincial Grand Master for the provinces of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. As no authenticated records exist of his tenure as Provincial Grand Master, it seems doubtful that he exercised any authority in Masonic endeavors as he died a few years after his appointment. ..<br>
<br>
To further complicate matters, by the 1750s, the Antient Grand Lodge of England (known to historians as the "Ancients"), a rival Masonic Grand Lodge, had also created a Provincial Grand Lodge of New York, which subsequently chartered lodges under its own jurisdiction. Additional lodges were chartered in New York by the Grand Lodge of Scotland and the Grand Lodge of Ireland. The Ancients retained their charter throughout the Revolution, however, and it was based upon this charter that an independent Grand Lodge of New York was created in 1781, with Robert R. Livingston as Grand Master. The Grand Lodge of New York was officially organized on December 15, 1782, under the Provincial Grand Warrant dated September 5, 1781, from the “Athol” or Antient Grand Lodge of England. The Grand Lodge declared its independence and assumed its modern title “Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York” on June 6, 1787.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0040">St. John's Lodge No. 1, A.Y.M.</span><br>
St. John's Lodge, chartered in 1757, is the oldest operating Lodge under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of New York.[5] St. John's Lodge is the custodian of what is now known as the George Washington Inaugural Bible. On April 30, 1789, it was upon this Bible that George Washington took his oath of office as the first President of the United States.[6]<br>
<br>
In 2009, the Lodge formed a registered public charity for the purpose of preserving, maintaining and restoring the George Washington Inaugural Bible. In 2014, the St. John's Lodge No. 1 Foundation, Inc. received recognition as an IRS 501(c)3<br>
<br>
Community and charity<br>
GLoNY has a long history of supporting charitable causes. Among the organizations that are rooted in its charitable endeavors are, the Masonic Medical Research Institute, Acacia Village and Masonic Home in Utica; the Chancellor Robert R. Livingston Library and Museum in New York and Utica; the Masonic Youth Camp at Camp Turk in Woodgate; the DeWint House at Tappan and its many charitable activities of its annual Brotherhood Fund Drive. <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The Grand Lodge sponsors Child Identification Programs</span></span>, Drug and Alcohol Awareness programs in schools, and gives thousands of dollars a day to worthy charities around the State.<br>
<br>
Organization of Triangles Inc.<br>
The Organization of Triangles Inc. is a Masonic youth movement for young women aged between 10 and 21 years old. The Organization of Triangles Inc. was founded in 1925 by Rose E. Scherer in the State of New York...Scherer was Great Matron of the Order of the Eastern Star.

The Southern Pacific Railroad of Mexico (reporting mark SPM)[1] was a railroad subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Mexico, operating from Nogales, Sonora, to Mazatlán, Sinaloa. The Sonora Railway was constructed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway between 1879 and 1882. In 1898 the Santa Fe leased the Sonora Railway to the Southern Pacific in return for the latter railroad's line from Needles to Mojave, California. This arrangement continued until December 1911, when the Southern Pacific purchased both the Sonora Railway and the New Mexico and Arizona. The following June, the Sonora Railway became part of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Mexico....<br>

Thermal (originally Kokell)began as a railroad camp in 1910 for employees of the Southern Pacific Railroad, followed by Mecca (originally called Walters) in 1915 and Arabia in between, each with about 1,000 residents. Permanent dwellings were soon established on Avenue 56 (renamed Airport Boulevard), former U.S. Route 99 (State Route 86) and State Route 111 by the 1930s.<br>
