			<div class="content">You may have heard of him; the "Argentinian Hitler", based conservative nationalist who fought the jew. This is a blatant lie which is demonstrably false. Share this with every faggot you see parroting that same piece of bullshit.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">BACKGROUND</span></strong> (Optional)<br>
<br>
You need to understand a bit of Argie History. In the 1920's, we had a president called Yrigoyen. This man, apart from being a freemason and a member of a party associated with socialists, was very popular in his time. He was the first president elected through secret and universal vote (before that votes were not secret and not every man could vote). He implemented some interventionist measures (that worsened the economy) and became some sort of populist hero; people voted for him, not for his party. <br>
He was deposed by a military coup which began the so-called "infamous decade" (not really a decade, and not that infamous, as you'll see). Peron, who was a minor officer in the military at the time, participated of the coup, as he admitted in one occasion.<br>
<br>
Remember, in that time Argentina was still among the major worldpowers; GDP like that of Australia, the US or the UK. Migrants from Italy, Spain and other countries came to earn a living here. Among them came many socialists and anarchists as well. During the 30's, during this dictatorship, the depression did have its impact on the economy, but Argentina remained fairly stable. This dictatorship, funded and promoted by oligarchical, conservative families, attempted to suppress the leftists, stop the advancement of the Yrigoyenist faction and install some sort of keynesian economy with lots of cronyism. This "infamous decade" was known as such because of political persecution and fraud, but during this time, even though it was a dictatorship, Argentina was still a good country. Certainly among the best in the world. The best in Latin America (along with Venezuela, btw!). If <em class="text-italics">that </em> period was infamy, imagine now! We still have all those things, but we're third world now.<br>
<br>
But eventually this dictatorship failed, and there was another coup in the 1943. This one attempted to align Argentina with Hitler's Germany against the judeo-masonic conspiracy (They would eventually side with the winners, declaring war on Germany in a symbollic way). It's curious, because Peronists tend to call the opposition "fascist", ignoring that Perón admired both Mussolini and Hitler. Perón was among the key members of the junta, but he wasn't the leader. He was minister of labor, and he used his role to gather support of the unionists, workers and capitalists as well. He told the latter that the idea behind his unionist movement was to put workers under the direction of the state in order to "neutralize" revolutionary tendencies.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Señores capitalistas, no se asusten de mi sindicalismo, nunca mejor que ahora estará seguro el capitalismo, ya que yo también lo soy, por que tengo estancia y en ella operarios. Lo que quiero es organizar estatalmente a los trabajadores, para que el Estado los dirija y les marque el rumbo y de esta manera se neutralizarán en su seno las corrientes ideológicas y revolucionarias que puedan poner en peligro la sociedad capitalista en la posguerrra”<br>
Juan Domingo Perón, en el discurso de la bolsa de comercio, 25 de agosto de 1944</div></blockquote>

The peronist march, which is the anthem of peronism, says that Perón "conquered" (earned the support of) the masses by "fighting the capital". It's an anti-capitalist statement. You're beginning to see his contradictions.<br>
<br>
He nationalized the central bank; you may think this is "based" because he took it from the jews, right? Nope, the bank was not owned by jews, it wasn't fully private and it would lead to major inflation because since it was nationalized, it gave the government the opportunity to print money to fund its projects. Keep reading.<br>
<br>
He met his wife Evita at a charity event after an earthquake. He did also have many lovers; Nelly Rivas, <span style="color:#00FFFF">a 14 year old girl</span>, "Piraña", another teenager and possibly many others. He would end up married to an exotic dancer. Evita would often wear very expensive jewelry and fur coats, while preaching to the poor and instigating the more radical towards a more socialist stance. After her death, she became a saint in the eyes of peronists. They literally prayed to her.<br>
<br>
But guess what? This dictatorship failed as well. Perón was arrested and the people demanded his liberation. He used this to jumpstart his career and ran for president. He won by a landslide. Some speculate that this was a strategy to ensure the continuity of the ruling faction. Seeing their regime fail, they decided to set up the opposition who would come to save them all. I cannot confirm it, but it wouldn't suprise me.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">HIS REGIME</span></strong><br>
<br>
His first presidency was characterized by an overall well-being. <span style="color:#FFBF00">Perón found the reserves of the country overflowing with gold ingots. By the end of his presidency, they were all spent.</span> Granted, some of it was spent on hospitals and other public works, but other things went to propaganda and general demagoguery. His regime was democratic in name only; he used thugs to make businesses have shrines with his image, he replaced the cross with his picture in schools, he indoctrinated children with "I love the leader" propaganda. He also created the "Peronist Youth", an organization meant to indoctrinate teens, meant to compete with the church. There were two sees; one for boys and the other for girls. <em class="text-italics"> The one for girls was right next to the presidential residence...</em><br>

This was material for children. Evita's book was mandatory study material at public schools.<br>

Book on the importance of indoctrination at a young age<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>And here we are now. Our civil armies of women, tamed and indoctrinated to teach and impart to children the soul of the Motherland; before schools, the child is shaped by Argentinian mothers in the cradle, who teach them to love Perón before they learn their blessings.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>At the moment we have almost 4 or 5 million of students; people who study. Who, if they aren't voting today, will vote tomorrow, let us not forget. We must begin convincing them since primary school. And I thank the mothers who teach them to say "Perón" before "Dad", that's too much but... But, in the first part of this individual process, indoctrination is indispensable. Therefore, primary school constitutes the first step of adherence and indoctrination of the coming citenzenry into the justicialist movement.</div></blockquote>

<br>
But this is not it.<span style="color:#FFFF00"> He nationalized all media</span>. If you think this is a good thing, it means all media is in the hands of the government. Artists and dissenters were exiled, disappeared, tortured and persecuted. Anti-peronist newspapers were shut down due to "bothersome noise" and having a dirty toilet. <span style="color:#00FFFF">All foreign commerce was in the hands of the state</span>, which meant that whether you exported or imported, the government was in control. This meant bureaucracy, corruption and, of course, scarcity. In fact, Paper was kept deliberately kept scarce, and the newspapers of the opposition could only have up to a certain amount of paper, meaning they had to reduce the size of their newspapers.<br>
<br>
His control of the national bank allowed him to print money to fund his projects (since he depleted all the reserves of the state). <span style="color:#FF8000">This caused inflation up to 20% </span>(according to official statistics. US has less than 2%). To solve this, he imposed price controls and invited people to, metaphorically, give "firewood" to those who updated prices and hang them from trees using wires. Basically, he was inciting his supporters to threaten and force businessmen to comply. This did not solve the inflation problem, by the way, because that's not how it works.<br>
<br>
His wife, like I mentioned, became a saint after death. Here's a follower of his saying he was greater than Christ:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fI1turK.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Christ also had flaw in his great heart. In this, both Perón and Christ were on par, though Christ settled with offering christianity to the world. Perón outdid him. He realized christianity. No little sermons! Christ, words. Perón, deeds. That is why Perón is the face of God glowing in the darkness of this hour. Who are we next to Perón? Less than nothing. Only Perón shines with his own light. The rest of us feed of his light. The peronist must attribute all failures and errors to himself. But the victories, the merits... Those are always Peron's. I founded this school, more than anything, to teach how to love Perón.Because we'll grow better each day if we  have our minds set on Perón. Each night, before bed, we must examine ourselves: Have I imitated Perón today? Because Perón does not err nor can he ever err. Because all geniuses and great men have suffered from errors and flaws. All of them, but Perón.</div></blockquote>

If you think he opposed the jews, guess again. <span style="color:#40FFFF">He was he first zionist president</span> (See "Los muchachos judíos peronistas" by Ranaan Rein and "El pacto Perón-Israel" by Cristian Rodrigo Iturralde).<span style="color:#BF00FF"> He also harbored nazi refugees.</span><br>
<br>
He intended to build a giant monument dedicated to Eva, the size of the Eiffel tower. as if changing the names of countless streets to "Perón" or "Eva Perón" wasn't enough, he named two provinces after them. He even built a city shaped after her profile. There were also trains and cinemas named after him, as well as an observatory and three celestial bodies that were discovered by it.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XdiLCB5.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
He also reformed the constitution, extending his term, allowing the government to detain people for up to thirty days without habeas corpus and allowing for the potential expropriation of private goods if deemed necessary by the state. A peronist governor, Domingo Mercante, was the first to outlaw homosexuals from voting; this was of course unenforceable, but the sentiment was there. Funny, because peronists are now champions of "LGBT rights".<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4C9AIZT.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Do you swear loyalty to the Liberator of the Republic, General Juan Perón and the Spiritual Head of the Nation, Eva Perón, their doctrine and their movement?(An oath before assuming public office)</div></blockquote>

Apart from that, he spent public money on a cold fusion project "Proyecto Huemul". In case you don't know, cold fusion would allow for practically infinite energy; imagine a nuclear reactor powered by hydrogen, the most common element in the universe. Needless to say, it was a scam. He also legalized both prostitution and divorce, as an attack on the church.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">AFTER HIS REGIME: EXILE AND RETURN</span></strong><br>
<br>
In 1955, there was a coup against him. Although it is constitutional to stage a coup in order to return to a republic, these successors did not do a good job at all. Perón knew the Seat of the Executive Branch was about to be bombed, and he purposefully called supporters to show up in the square to resist, thus blaming their deaths on his enemies. Though this attack didn't depose him, he did call for elections and was exiled to Francoist Spain. After the attack, in which more than a hundred civilians died (not solely Perón's fault), some people (it was never known if they were peronists or socialists who took advantage of the situation) went out and burned churches. The police and the firefighters, who were peronists, allowed them to burn for an entire day, as a punishment to the conservative, national-catholic faction who tried to depose him.<br>
<br>
From Spain, he'd send letters to <span style="color:#FF0040">far-left paramilitary guerrillas</span> like the FAP, Montoneros and others, expressing support. The idea behind this was to instigate terrorist attacks and popular uprising to apply political pressure, which would call for his return to pacify and mediate. He also expressed support for Che Guevara, Fidel Castro and Mao Zedong, which he identified as allies which shared a similar political vision. His return was aided by the Propaganda Due, an irregular Italian masonic lodge to which he belonged as a 33rd degree initiate, involved in corruption and with mafias, the Vatican and anti-communist terrorist groups. This project was named "Operation Gianoglio".<br>
<br>
By his return, the country was divided. There were anti peronists and peronists. And peronists were divided between left-wing peronists, who saw peronism as a movement towards socialism and orthodox peronists, who assumed a "third position" between free market capitalism and communism, with an emphasis on labor unions. Perón eventually rejected the leftists, and they returned to terrorism. He created the Argentinian Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A) in order to exterminate the very same movements he promoted for his own benefit. He died in the year 1974 and left his new wife, "Isabelita", <span style="color:#FF00FF">a former exotic dancer</span> in charge as the first female president of Argentina. The puppetmaster behind her was López Rega, who was an esotericist.<span style="color:#FFBF00"> Legend has it he tried to resurrect Perón by shouting "Wake up, Pharaoh"</span>. Eventually, things got out of control and, in full Argentinian fashion, there was another coup.<br>
<br>
To this day, modern peronists identify more with the left-wing faction. In fact, <span style="color:#FF0000">some of the terrorists are currently in the government.</span><br>

			<div class="content">Banned the media, homosexuals, got his commie supporters bombed, and knew nothing about the economy? Sounds great! I see though. He sounds like a more ballsy Donald Trump, praised by the very people he stabbed in the back. Also a Zionist who had like 20 wives. Tis a pity. If there's anything to learn here I guess it's if a populist is particularly immoral in some way, don't trust them, they're probably lying to you.</div>
