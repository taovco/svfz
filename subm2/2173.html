			<div class="content">Argentina had the strictest quarantine, and I can attest that almost all people, save for a handful of isolated cases, wore masks, kept distance, stayed home, avoided parties and other social gatherings, etc.<br>
<br>
We were in the top 10 countries with the most cases, and then among the top 12.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Argentina lockdown early and hard. Now cases are exploding</div></blockquote>
    <br>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-argentina-million-quarantine-lockdown/2020/10/26/65eefde2-149c-11eb-bc10-40b25382f1be_story.html" class="postlink">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/th ... story.html</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Coronavirus: Argentina's never-ending quarantine<br>
People across Argentina have begun speaking of "quaranternity" while enduring the world's longest lockdown. Residents in Buenos Aires have been cooped up for five months now and their nerves are frazzled.</div></blockquote>
    <br>

<br>
___________________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Given the extension of the quarantine, and how displeased the common (white) folk are with this administration, there was a massive demonstration. I was there.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/cLIE2PZW-zvLY8Anp3EDA5k7PPk=/768x432/filters:format%28jpg%29:quality%2885%29/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/U6QAZPAW7RDNNNPROQVN4YU3LA.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Protest_in_Argentina_2020.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
See if you can find me in the crowd. I think the images don't do it justice. A video was posted a while ago, so it's probably in the archive. That shows how massive and multitudinary the marches were. The demographics show a clear pattern of decent, nice people; mostly white. A few Venezuelans were also spotted there (they are the best argument for civic nationalism). <br>
<br>
I need to clarify that the protest wasn't just about the lockdown; it was about blantant corruption and the nonchalant attitude that the government had about it, the destruction of our country, the advance of the left and statism, the extremely high taxation, inflation and also the excessive quarantine which was taking a toll on an already wrecked economy.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is we all wore masks. Even I did, and I was among the people who took off their masks from the very beginning. Why did we wear them? We knew that the government and some media would try to hold it against us and blame us for the deaths. It had the benefit of covering our faces and hiding our identities, so that we wouldn't be smeared or harassed.<br>
<br>
The government was very salty about this; and rightly so. He made a statement a few days later, coinciding with the 17th of October, Day of Peronist Loyalty. He mentioned how "the oligarchy" tried to deny rights to the lower classes using excuses such as "the republic" (The opposition, of course, openly manifested to protect and keep the republic).<br>
    <br>
There was also a peronist demonstration full of brown people who didn't wear the masks their beloved government told them to. No condemnation of it. And attendance was far, far lower; limited to just people with affilliations to labour unions.<br>
<br>

<br>
A few months later, Maradona died. In case you live under a rock, he was practically regarded as a living deity. He was considered to be even better than Messi, and brought us many moments of joy and pride. Football has a key role in our culture, so it was to be expected that his death would have marches and public demonstrations.<br>
<br>
The government hosted them, and didn't utter a word about covid even though mask use was... lax. To say the least.<br>
<br>

<br>
Just like every event which involves these niggers, there were riots<br>
<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/raquel_da/status/1331896057408724998?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1331896057408724998%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elespanol.com%2Fdeportes%2Ffutbol%2F20201126%2Ftension-velatorio-maradona-altercados-policiales-casa-rosada%2F538946461_0.html" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/raquel_da/status/13 ... 461_0.html</a> .<br>
<br>
They even stormed the Pink House; our equivalent of the White House. If you want to know why it's pink... it is said to have been painted with white paint and the blood of Indians because we were short on white paint. Or the blood of cows, according to another, more boring, legend.<br>
<br>
They didn't have any issues with massive gatherings when abortion was being discussed by the senate. In all fairness, they didn't criticize the pro-life side either. Need I mention that they weren't wearing masks?<br>
<br>
________________________________________________<br>
<br>
The government didn't hesitate to release prisoners with the excuse of covid (there were already mentions of "prison overpopulation" at the beginning of the administration...) in spite of there being no cases in certain facilities. The solution was to release them. Some reoffended. Others rioted because they "refused to die". I made a post on this at ClownWorld. Worth checking out.<br>
<br>
Also, some people with covid and doctors were harrassed for carrying the disease along with them. A doctor's car was burned, for example.<br>
<br>

<br>
"Vacunagate" (vaccinegate) is the name given to a recent massive corruption scandal about government officials and cronies, some of them in their twenties, getting vaccinated, when those vaccines were meant to be destined to the vulnerable and the elderly. Now, I'm very skeptical of this vaccine, as are many of you, which is why I didn't post anything on it since I think the point would be missed. The government kept praising the vaccine, while imposing a strict quarantine and demonizing people who dissented as irresponsible or incompassionate... and now they're getting shot themselves before the people who "need it" do. Bear in mind that Argentina hasn't reached a million vaccinated patients (and we're approximately 40 million people).<br>
<br>
But how did the government react to this scandal?<br>
<br>
Well, the president did fire the minister of health (who said he could bring the government down if he opened his mouth), however...<br>
<br>
He said giving a vaccine to someone who cut in line is not a crime. He also told the judicial branch to "cut it with the clownishness" (foolishness).<br>
<br>
_____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
The people protested by putting mannequins within body bags with a sign saying "I died because (name of crony) had my vaccine". The president twisted it on twitter by claiming that the bags were meant as death threats towards politicians (implying the dead bodies were those of politicians, completely distorting the message).<br>
    <br>
The Province of Formosa, which has had the same governor for 25 fucking years, has been having human rights abuses by keeping infected patients captive and forcibly isolated for days. A representative claimed that "You do have the right [to ambulate freely], but this is a pandemic". Even the Pope and the UN, known for their leftism, spoke out on this.<br>

Minister of Health admitted they banend joggers because of public image rather than because they represented a risk.<br>
