			<div class="content">Around the internet there abound millions of quotes about world government, satanism, jewish or jesuit control and many others. Many of them are true. But some of them are not. And maybe it's done on purpose. Why?<br>
<br>
Step 1: You have a true conspiracy which you want to keep hidden<br>
Step 2: Some legit quotes are used as evidence against it<br>
Step 3: Covertly promote fake quotes which attract the attention of people with outrageous claims such as "Yes, we admit we want to rule the world and enslave humanity".<br>
Step 4: People take them as true because they don't bother to check sources<br>
Step 5: You can "debunk" the fake ones by showing there are no sources for that.<br>
<br>
Result: You discredit the actual conspiracy, because it's been "debunked".<br>
<br>
SOLUTION:<br>
<br>
Check the sources. Every time you find a quote about a jewish rabbi (typically "Harry Waton") saying how they want to conquer the world, try to find the original source and save it; screenshots, archiving, getting the actual book and taking a pic, whatever.<br>
<br>
Some say that without a source, a claim is useless. I don't think it's true. A claim without source (or with a false source) is working in their favor.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"That which is said without evidence can be dismissed without evidence"</em><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"</em><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"Pics or it didn't happen"<br>
<br>
"Don't believe everything you read on the internets"<br>
<br>
"Everybody lies"<br>
<br>
"Source: Trust me dude"</em></div>

			<div class="content">There have been fake quotes circulating around; quotes that were allegedly said by jews or by historical figures. These quotations were probably created to "bait" us; tricking us into believing it is true, only for it to be later "debunked", making us all look like morons. Some of these quotes can be found in documentaries like Europa: The last battle and even some of Dennis Wise's.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: I was originally going to include James Deen's "We jews know we are better than everyone else" because I couldn't find any source. Turns out, he did say that in an interview for Forward done by Emily Shire. Can you guess why it was kinda hard to find?... I'm open to hear sources and evidence in case one of these quotes is actually true.<br>
<br>
"We butchered the wrong pig" - Winston Churchill. This phrase is widely known but considered apocryphal. The source being "The New Statesman and Nation, volume 35, page 373, dated 28th August 1948". If anyone can find this article, it'd be great. According to Richard Langdom, a scholar specialized in Winston Churchill, he didn't say any of the famous quotes attributed to him. Either way, I don't particularly trust mainstream historians.<br>
<br>
"If Germany begins trading in the next 50 years we will have fought the war (WW1) for nothing" - Winston Churchill. I couldn't find anything online. Either way, WW1 did have as it's purpose to destroy Germany (and to destroy all empires to establish a world government, an effort led by freemasons, as I will show in another post) because it was a growing world power that threatened the UK.<br>
<br>
"Germany's unforgivable crime before WW2 was its attempt to loosen its economy out of the world trade system and to build up an own exchange system from which the world-finance couldn't profit anymore."- Winston Churchill. This phrase is allegedly from a book called "Propaganda in the next War" by Sydney Rogerson, written in 1938. How could Churchill or the author speak about WW2 before it even started? Some sources say the book was written in 1939, and the phrase "World war 2" was first mentioned in September of 1939, in a magazine. The term was popularized in 1942 by Roosevelt. I couldn't find an archive of the full book, only a few pages. It did say, though, that Jews hated Germany and all other "dictator countries" backed by the Catholic Church, though this probably refers to NatSoc Germany. This phrase is often accompanied by "We butchered the wrong pig".<br>
<br>
“Our race will rule undisputed over the world. Our superior intelligence will easily enable us to retain mastery over a world of dark peoples". This is allegedly from a speech by Rabbi Rabinovich, but attributed to Eustace Mullins. It may be a fabrication, however there was jewish author who did say this openly in a book called "The Jews and modern capitalism", page 62<br>
<br>
"A racial program for the twentieth century". Allegedly written by Israel Cohen, again attributed to Eustace Mullins. Though there is no way to find out whether the speech was real, it is absolutely worth reading because it all became true.<br>
<br>
"The jewish people will be their own messiah". This is a letter allegedly sent to Karl Marx by Baruch Levy. While it did appear in a magazine called La Revue (Here) we don't know whether it was actually sent by him or if it was a forgery. It may be false becaue it is too short and too obvious; why would a jew have to explain the prophecy of Isaiah's jewish world government to another jew? I don't even know if it is in the talmud. It goes without saying that Marx was of rabbinic ancestry, probably belonged to freemasonry (google hidden hand) and communism was overwhelmingly jewish; funded, carried out, and promoted.<br>
<br>
Protocols of Zion. The protocols of Zion are considered to be a forgery because certain parts were taken from a book called "Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu". Besides, it doesn't mention communism, zionism, race-mixing, kabbalah, the talmud or anything the jews are known for. Either way, some of its postulates did happen in real life.<br>
<br>
"We the jews are the destroyers..." - Maurice Samuel. This quote is real, taken from a book called "You Gentiles" but often misunderstood. I read the chapter called "We, the destroyers". It's basically a jew kvetching about how the goyim don't have it in their nature to build a good society and that jews are the "destroyers" of that because they seek social justice, etc. etc. etc. While not an admission of a conspiracy, still a text against the hated goyim.<br>
<br>
"We did it" - Ben Bernanke. This quote is regarding the Great Depression. Milton Friedman and his wife Emma Goldman theorized the Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve, which lowered interest rates in the 1920's (Which is why it's known as the "Roaring Twenties", due to its short-lived, artificial economic growth). Ben Bernanke said he agreed with their view; "We" (The Federal Reserve) did it. He didn't mean jews. Of course, the Federal Reserve is very jewish; I don't know if they did that on purpose but it wouldn't surprise anyone. I read about freemasons and even the Catholic Church taking advantage of the upcoming crisis to do business, but I haven't done much research about it.<br>
<br>
"To learn who rules over you, simple look who you're not allowed to criticize"- Voltaire. This quote has no source; there is no specific Voltaire (who didn't like jews himself) work that contains it. It was probably coined by Kevin Strom in a 1993 essay called "All America must know the terror that is upon us" which can be found online.<br>
<br>
“You must understand that this war is not against Hitler or National Socialism but against the strength of the German people, which is to be smashed once and for all, whether it is in the hands of Hitler or a Jesuit priest!”- Winston Churchill. Supposedly in Emrys Hughes, British Bulldog, 145. If anyone can find the book and check the source, I'd appreciate it.<br>
<br>
"The great ideal of Judaism is that the whole world shall be imbued with Jewish teachings, and that in a Universal Brotherhood of Nations - a greater Judaism in fact - all the separate races and religions shall disappear." (Jewish World, February 9, 1933). I couldn't find the source, but there was an interview with a rabbi in which he says the goal of the messiah is to bring the world to the noahide laws ("When Israel is mighty", it can be found in Know More News). It makes more sense once you realize the mormonism, founded by freemasons such as Brigham Young and Joseph Smith supported zionism and taught gnostic, freemasonic and kabbalistic notions (handshakes, passwords to the heavens, self-deification, etc.).<br>
<br>
Let me issue a nation's currency and I care not who makes its laws" - Mayer Amschel Rothschild. I found it in "National Economy And The Banking System Of The United States". No idea of the original source.<br>
<br>
Sarkozy's "metissage" speech. From what I could gather, he didn't mean forcing people to breed. Either way, he was advocating for state-mandated multiculturalism (which is redundant since it is the state the one that forces its population to endure it).<br>
<br>
"Some call it marxism, I call it judaism"- Stephen Wise. This quote was published in American Bulletin of May 15, 1935. I could not find that article (there's a website that only has some of the issues of that year, but not the one of May), but it may be worth reading since it is a NatSoc magazine.<br>
<br>
Albert Pike's Three world wars letter. This one is downright stupidly false. It's supposed to be a letter sent by Albert Pike (head of American Masonry) to Giuseppe Mazzini, head of Italian Freemasonry in 1871 in which he details the plans for three world wars (describing exactly what happened in all of them) to install the cult of Lucifer in the world. It doesn't make sense that in the 1870's he would write "The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine" because the words "fascism" and "nazism" didn't exist back them. "Luciferianism" isn't worship of Lucifer, it's the idea the Lucifer gave humanity intellect or knowledge so that they can become like gods (Genesis 3:22, notice how 322 is the number of Skull and Bones). This notion of self deification can be found in Kabbalah (Daath), Mormonism (Exaltation), Gnosticism (Gnosis), Taoism (inner alchemy), and of course, Freemasonry (self-enlightenment/statue sculpting itself), etc.</div>
