			<div class="content">Today is designated Earth Day .. why do we need one?  April 22nd.. 4+2+2..<br>
<br>
I thought I'd look into Earth Day some more because it's come up in pizzagate in the past..like here:<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00FF40">ROCKEFELLER University Pediatrician Molested 1000's of Boys in NY over 50 year period. </span><a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2910807/15565356" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2910807/15565356</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color:#FF0040">Earth Day</span>:<br>
<br>
In the late 1990's, a document called the "Earth Charter" was drafted by a group of prominent Humanist-Socialists including: Steven Rockefeller, Maurice Strong, Mikhail Gorbachev<br>
<br>
In place of the simple elegance of the rules for self-government and social stability expressed above, <span style="color:#FF0040">the Earth Charter calls for the imposition of a global tyranny over every aspect of human activity which becomes evident once you strip away the rhetorical devices and eco-socialist jargon.</span><br>
<br>
The Earth Charter was inscribed on papyrus paper and enshrined in a wooden box called the <span style="color:#FF0040">"Ark of Hope"</span> which was decorated with neo-pagan, politically correct artwork and paraded around the world by a troupe of believers. According to the official description, the carrying poles for the Ark are "unicorn horns" which ward off evil spirits (I'm not making this up, see for yourself).<br>
<br>
..<span style="color:#FF0040">the Earth Charter needs to be looked into. It leads back to the UN Sustainability Agenda, the Lucis Trust</span> and a number of dodgy characters and psyops...eg: the Hampstead case. ...<br>
and<br>
<br>
Ark of Hope for Children is empowering advocates and donors to bring care and awareness to those victimized as children by <span style="color:#FF0040">human trafficking, child abuse and bullying</span>. Ark of Hope is a human rights umbrella organization using a trauma informed approach to serve survivors through our various programs.<br>
<br>
Whenever you see the words "trauma informed approach" think Sandy Hook.</div></blockquote>

So, let's get started at trusty wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, <span style="color:#FFFF40">peace activist John McConnell</span> proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be observed on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations.</div></blockquote>

Vomit.. whenever I see 'peace' and 'United Nations' in the same sentence... still have to do that post on the Peace Corps... but I digress..<br>

<br>
John McConnell was born on March 22, 1915 in Davis City, Iowa. He was the son of a Pentecostal preacher[9] and traveling doctor.[6] <span style="color:#FFFF40">His first interest in the Earth began in 1939 while partnering with Albert Nobell, a chemist, in the Nobell Research Laboratory in Los Angeles that built <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">a factory for manufacture of plastic</span></span>...</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mr. McConnell and Erling Toness, an editor in North Carolina, published a weekly newspaper, the Toe Valley View. Life Magazine carried a feature story, "Trouble in the Toe Valley," about their efforts against local violence and corruption. o­n October31, 1957, (right after the first Sputnik) Mr. McConnell wrote an editorial entitled, "Make Our Satellite A Symbol Of Hope," calling for peaceful cooperation in the exploration of Space with a visible "Star of Hope" Satellite... This led Mr. McConnell to form a Star of Hope organization to foster International Cooperation in Space. In pursuit of this goal, Mr. McConnell, in 1958, obtained support in Geneva of the President of the Atoms for Peace Conference and other leaders, including Dr. Glen Seaborg of the United States and Professor A. P. Alexandrov of the U.S.S.R.</div></blockquote>

Sean Penn's Haiti-focused charity, J/P HRO, is now going by the name CORE as the nonprofit expands its reach from Haiti to communities in the United States and the Caribbean. <a href="https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2964970/16038514" class="postlink">https://searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2964970/16038514</a><br>

Watch him use this as an excuse to go on the media circus, I mean circuit, to further push the globalists agenda .. he'll talk about how we're losing 'free speech'.. everyone will side with him, and forget his Epstein-transhumanism connections.. and he'll continue to push his cult of scientism..<br>
<br>
It's called 'reverse psychology'..<br>

			<div class="content">Satish Kumar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satish_Kumar" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satish_Kumar</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Satish Kumar (born 9 August 1936)[1] is an Indian British activist and speaker. He has been a Jain monk, nuclear disarmament advocate and pacifist[3]. Now living in England, Kumar is founder and Director of Programmes of the Schumacher College international centre for ecological studies, and is Editor Emeritus of Resurgence &amp; Ecologist magazine. His most notable accomplishment is the completion, together with a companion, E. P. Menon, of a peace walk of over 8,000 miles in 1973–4, from <span style="color:#FFFF40">New Delhi</span> to Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington, D.C., the capitals of the world's earliest nuclear-armed countries...<br>
<br>
..At the age of 9, he left his family and became a Jain monk.[6] At 18, after reading a book by Mahatma Gandhi, he ran away from the mendicant order, to become a student of Vinoba Bhave..<br>
<br>
Peace walk<br>
Inspired by Bertrand Russell's civil disobedience against the atomic bomb, in 1962 Kumar and his friend E.P. Menon decided to dedicate themselves to undertaking a peace walk from India to the four capitals of the nuclear world: Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington D.C. and decided to carry no money on their trip. They called it a 'Pilgrimage for peace'.<br>
<br>
..Vinoba Bhave gave the young men two <span style="color:#FF0040">'gifts'</span>. One was to be penniless wherever they walked. The other was to be vegetarian. ..<br>
<br>
While on their way to Moscow they met two women outside a tea factory. After explaining what they were doing one of the women gave them four packets of tea, one to be delivered to each of the leaders of the four nuclear powers and to also deliver a message, "when you think you need to press the button, stop for a minute and have a fresh cup of tea". This further inspired their journey and became in part the reason for it. They eventually delivered 'peace tea' to the leaders of four of the nuclear powers...<br>
<br>
.. He contributed an essay to <span style="color:#FFFF40">The Society for Curious Thought</span> entitled "Focus on Food".[9] He has also been a contributor to the BBC's "Thought for the Day" strand on the Today programme, and also appeared on Desert Island Discs. Kumar was interviewed by Richard Dawkins in his 'Slaves to Superstition' episode of the documentary The Enemies of Reason, investigating the prevalence of unscientific beliefs in modern society. He also made a film, Earth Pilgrim, for BBC2's Natural History Series.<br>
<br>
..Kumar was one of the contributors for writing the book, We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009... The royalties from the sale of this book go to the indigenous rights organisation, <span style="color:#FFFF40">Survival International</span>...<br>
<br>
Prior to the 2015 UK general election, he was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the <span style="color:#FF0040">Green Party's Caroline Lucas</span>.</div></blockquote>

Vinoba Bhave <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinoba_Bhave" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinoba_Bhave</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Criticism<br>
<span style="color:#0080BF"><span style="text-decoration:underline">V.S. Naipaul</span></span> has scathingly criticised Bhave in his collection of essays citing his lack of connection with rationality and excessive imitation of Gandhi. Even some of his admirers find fault with the extent of his devotion to Gandhi. Much more controversial was his support, ranging from covert to open, to the Congress Party's government under Indira Gandhi, which was fast becoming unpopular. He controversially backed the Indian Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, calling it Anushasana Parva (Time for Discipline).

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><em class="text-italics">So what led to Survival International forming in 1969</em>?<br>
<br>
.. Six months before the Norman Lewis article I was on an expedition up the Orinoco in a hovercraft (1968). There were 22 scientists and television people who were calling it 'the greatest journey on Earth'. The only other sane person was Conrad Gorinsky who was a ethnobotanist and a quarter Indian. We were the only ones who had been in the jungle before and who spoke Spanish and Portuguese. Conrad was a research scientist at Bart's Hospital, and we travelled up some smaller rivers together to try and reach the tribes <span style="color:#FFFF40">to consult them about potentially therapeutic plants.</span>...<br>
<br>
..But there was already word coming out of Brazil about the massacres of the Indians that were exposed later by Norman Lewis, and we talked about this endlessly..We talked and talked, and agreed there should be an organisation. We were going to call it WEAP: World Ecological Areas Project.<br>
<br>
Then a couple of months later, out came the article, followed by a letter by <span style="color:#FFFF40">Francis Huxley and Nicolas Guppy</span>. We got onto them, and they also said there should be an organisation, and Conrad and I looked at each other and said 'that's our idea!'... there were about 10 or a dozen people at that first meeting including John Hemming, Teddy Goldsmith, Guppy and Huxley and Conrad, and we just sat around talking and we decided to meet every week for the next 5, 6 or 7 weeks..<br>
<br>
Then Teddy said 'my brother's got some money'. So we had a dinner at the Clermont Club that was hosted by James Goldsmith, who went on to become the richest man in the world. He laid on this dinner which was our first fundraising event and we raised £2000, which was enough for us to get a basement in Craven Street, which was part of the Royal Anthropological Institute. They had a spare room downstairs.<br>
<br>
I found a bright young man called Robert Allen; an anthropology student who I employed, and we spent a lot of time with Tommy Franklin who walked me through the minefield of registering a charity. It was very bureaucratic and boring. We needed patrons and there was a lot of discussion about whether we should have a Royal patron, and we never did, though <span style="color:#FF0040">Princes Philip and Charles were involved later</span>. Julian Huxley, Peter Scott, Malcolm MacDonald, Lawrence Van Der Post and other people nobly put their names to what we were doing...<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">The Ecologist magazine also started at Craven Street, with Teddy as editor. Was it in the same building?</em><br>
<br>
It was actually the same office. As I recall it, February 69 was when Survival started, and by 1970 we were beginning to do stuff. My recollection is that Teddy and Robert Allen 'eloped' together but all Robert had to do was just move across the room! Teddy always believed that the spark that started the Ecology movement was the concern for the survival of tribal people. .. Teddy and Robert and Francis Huxley and his girlfriend and others used to come down and stay with us. We had a lot of house parties in Cornwall. It was a big house, and there are several entries in my guest book recording their visits in the summer of 1970 especially. Teddy himself always said that it was falling in love with Cornwall and coming to stay here, that persuaded him to move down and bring the ecology movement to Withiel near <span style="color:#FFFF40">Bodmin</span>..<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics"><span style="color:#FF0040">Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace were founded at around the time. Did you have much contact with them?</span></em><br>
<br>
Oh yes. Certainly when Jonathan Porrit was involved. Most of the big charitable organisations were founded in Britain. And it was a particularly fertile time.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics"><span style="color:#FF0040">And <span style="text-decoration:underline">Satish Kumar</span> and James Lovelock? They were in the South West too.</span></em><br>
<br>
Yes, though they were more in Teddy's world than mine.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Another aspect to this was the fact that you and Teddy and the other editors of The Ecologist were interested in farming, and in the 70's all ran farms down here in Cornwall</em><br>
<br>
I was a conventional hill farmer in those days with cattle and sheep. Dare I say it I was a proper farmer and Teddy was a dilettante, but he had some pioneering ideas about this. Peter Bunyard had some particularly radical ideas on organic farming. <br>
<br>
It was a fascinating time. There were the Paris student riots of 1968, and people like Levi-Strauss, who was a huge supporter of Survival International, were influential. I never met Levi-Strauss, though I know Teddy did, but I spoke to him on the phone and corresponded with him.<br>
<br>
Sir Edmund Leach was president of Royal Anthropological Society. We had a joint committee and had some interesting meetings discussing the way ahead. I'd been invited to go to Brazil in 1971 and we were preparing for that. A book had just come out called 'The Fierce People' by Napolean Chagnon (1968). He did his fieldwork with the short and very feisty Yanomami. He wrongly accused them of cannibalism and infanticide and he gave them a very bad press, so at the meeting Edmund Leach said 'there's no point in meeting with the Yanomami they are so subhuman the sooner they die out the better'.<br>
<br>
That was a seminal moment for me and others within Survival because we realised that there were people with whom we fundamentally disagreed. This has stayed with me during the following decades: that there are people who think that some peoples are so inferior that they should be allowed to die out.<br>
<br>
 .......It was similar with Sting, who I got to know quite well. He initially devoted all his efforts to Survival, and then decided to start something up on his own. Sting was brilliant at putting forward his story and was at the peak of his fame, but he blew it by starting up the <span style="color:#FFFF40">Rainforest Foundation Fund</span>. He ended up confusing the message. There was a bad moment when I was asked on television about whether he'd damaged the cause, and I had to say that he'd done more harm than good. And of course I wasn't forgiven, though we made it up later. That was one of the few hiccups in Survival's history.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">And the journalist on that Guardian piece about COVID in New Delhi is <span style="color:#FFFF40">Hannah Ellis-Petersen</span> :<br>
<br>
Here's a 2017 article from her: <span style="color:#00FF40">Art of the state: how the Venice Biennale is tackling the refugee crisis</span> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/16/venice-biennale-refugee-crisis-nsk-tunisia" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesig ... sk-tunisia</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 1992, amid the collapse of socialism and the tumultuous breakup of Yugoslavia, a group of artists came together to create a utopian fictional state. Part art project, part political statement, the state – called NSK – reconsidered what a modern globalised nation could be. It was rooted in no single territory and citizens were welcome from anywhere the world....<br>
<br>
Now, 25 years later, NSK have set up a national pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale and are handing out passports to anyone who wishes to become a citizen.<br>
<br>
It marks a trend at this year’s Biennale, an event divided so obviously down national lines. While NSK are issuing passports that disregard national borders, the Tunisian pavilion have also chosen to eschew a traditional art exhibition, and instead have created a kiosk issuing “freesas” – <span style="color:#FF0040">documents representing an idyllic world where “human beings may flow freely from one nation to the next”.</span><br>
<br>
Both are a direct response to the ever mounting refugee crisis and the rise of populist nationalism across Europe. And, in a potent reversal of power, both pavilions have also taken the step of putting refugees, or those who have attempted to flee their home country, in charge.<br>
<br>
The NSK pavilion provides a particularly stark alternative to the Biennale’s 85 official pavilions, which each represent a country with defined territory, borders and laws. NSK citizens are global, its borders are non-existent and it does not have to compete with, or rely on, any other country. “NSK is not in competition with spatial states, so it can rethink what being and belonging might mean,” said pavilion curators Zdenka Badovinac and . “It can breathe the air of statehood without choking.”<br>
<br>
There are 15,000 passport-holding citizens of NSK across the world, including <span style="color:#FF0040"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Marina Abramović</span>, Slavoj Žižek  and Hans Ulrich Obrist</span>, yet their decision to set up a pavilion as a passport office at the Biennale is not simply to swell their numbers.
</div></blockquote>

It's just Art, dahling.....<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The largest number of NSK passports were issued in Sarajevo in 1995, after the end of the war, for people looking for an alternative to the state that they legally belonged to...<br>
<br>
Stranger still, in 2004, out of nowhere, thousands of passport applications started arriving at the NSK headquarters in Ljubljana from Nigeria. It emerged that word had spread in Nigeria that NSK was a beautiful country that was accepting new citizens. It became such an issue that the Slovenian foreign ministry asked NSK to publish a statement clarifying that an NSK passport was not an internationally valid travel document....<br>
<br>
The use of refugees in the NSK pavilion and the young people in the Tunisian pavilion raises moral questions about turning these individuals into an art spectacle to be gawked at by the Biennale masses. Communication is one issue; the four boys taking part in the Tunisian pavilion do not speak English, though a translator is on hand.<br>
<br>
It is a grey area that also occurs in <span style="color:#FF0040">Olafur Eliasson</span>’s Green Light project at this year’s Biennale, in which he has set up a workshop in the central pavilion manned entirely by asylum seekers and refugees. The green lamps the refugees make are sold for €250 each, and those taking part also have access to free language classes, counselling education and other workshops.</div></blockquote>

We have pleasure to announce that Our World is the World Game that Buckminster Fuller envisioned many years ago in the 1960's..<br>
<br>
We really love his Dymaxion Map, which shows Spaceship Earth as one island in one ocean and is actually more accurate than the traditional maps we still use today, which appear to emphasise more of what divides us rather than what unites us as Fuller map does...<br>
<br>
Fuller also created many other amazing ground breaking inventions such as the Dymaxion House and Geosic Domes which were and still are a revolutionary house/dome made out of triangles formed in a sphere which proved to be much stronger that traditional rectangular houses. <br>

Shortly before his first arrest, Salmon was hailed by Princess Diana for taking 300 ill and disabled children to Disney World in Florida. He was asked to join the inaugural Dreamflight charity trip, co-founded by former British Airways cabin crew member Patricia Pearce in 1987, as chief medical officer. The former doctor said he was phoned by British Airways and asked to pick 300 'very sick and handicapped' children who would benefit from the once-in-a-lifetime experience. Princess Diana waved the flight off from Heathrow Airport, with 298 young children  aboard, including one of the girls who later claimed Salmon indecently touched her during a medical appointment...<br>

He insisted on being addressed as ‘Dr’ in his church and golf club circles, where he said he was descended directly from the Duke of Northumberland. One resident said: ‘He told us he was related to the Percy family of Northumberland. He went up to Alnwick Castle and he said he could see the family likeness in the portraits.’ The Duke of Northumberland currently lives at Alnwick Castle (home of Hogwarts School in the Harry Potter film and was also the backdrop for the film Elizabeth), His children are friends with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry and the Duke’s son, Earl Percy, has been frequently photographed with Pippa Middleton....
