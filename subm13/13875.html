			<div class="content">Several Kildare schools named in shocking report of where sex abuse allegedly occurred<br>
<a href="https://www.leinsterleader.ie/news/home/1596939/several-kildare-schools-named-in-shocking-report-of-where-sex-abuse-allegedly-occurred.html" class="postlink">https://www.leinsterleader.ie/news/home ... urred.html</a><br>
<br>
The establishment of a State inquiry into historical sexual abuse is one of a number of recommendations made by Senior Counsel, Mary O’Toole in her report to the Minister. You can see a full list of schools where allegations have been made at the bottom of this article.<br>
<br>
The Scoping Inquiry organised a Survivor Engagement process where those who had experienced sexual abuse<br>
 in day and boarding schools run by religious orders were invited to come forward and share their views regarding <br>
an appropriate State response.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Participants reported experiences of sexual abuse in primary, post-primary and special schools, both public and private, run by religious orders across the country.<br>
<br>
The report of the Scoping Inquiry contains detailed accounts of sexual abuse, rape and sexual assault and is deeply distressing to read.<br>
<br>
Minister Foley is making the full report of the independent Scoping Inquiry available to those who participated <br>
in the Scoping Inquiry’s Survivor Engagement process first, in line with her previous commitment to them and the sensitive and personal nature of its contents. It will subsequently be published online later today.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Minister Foley said: “The Report of the Scoping Inquiry is a harrowing document, containing some of the most appalling accounts of sexual abuse. The scale and horror of what people described in their interviews with the Scoping Inquiry is shocking, and the lasting impact on the lives of those survivors cannot be overstated. I have<br>
 been deeply moved by the courage, fortitude and openness of all those who have shared their experiences.<br>
<br>
“I am thinking of all those who came forward today as part of the Scoping Inquiry process and indeed those <br>
who are not in a position to do so at this point in their lives. I wish to remember and acknowledge in particular<br>
 the late Mark Ryan, who, with his brother David, was instrumental in the establishment of the Scoping Inquiry. <br>
He is very much in our hearts today, and I am mindful that the first anniversary of his passing is approaching in <br>
the coming weeks.<br>
<br>
“I am announcing today that the government has accepted the principal recommendation of the Report of the Scoping Inquiry, which is for the establishment of a Commission of Investigation. Historical sexual abuse is a profoundly serious matter and needs to be examined in detail.<br>
<br>
“One of the most compelling aspects of the Report is that older participants provided devastating accounts <br>
of how sexual abuse in childhood has affected their entire lives, from their schooldays through adolescence, early adulthood and right through to later years.<br>
<br>
“I am pleased to note that the report states that current child protection measures in schools are robust and effective and I am conscious that the safety of children today is a matter of paramount concern to survivors and<br>
 all of society.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Further recommendations relate to improving the experience for survivors in legal processes and the <br>
establishment<br>
 of dedicated support services for survivors, particularly in relation to the Commission and potential participation in that process.<br>
<br>
The Scoping Inquiry commissioned independent expert reports on child protection in our schools and restorative justice as part of its work.<br>
<br>
Minister Foley said: “I also want to acknowledge that there are many other people whose work and advocacy<br>
 have brought us to this important moment, and to extend my sincere gratitude to everyone who has contributed to this process in any way, whether through their own participation or their support for a family member or friend. I also want to thank the Scoping Inquiry team, the Lead, Mary O’Toole, and the survivor engagement lead, Kieran McGrath for their diligent work in producing what is a very detailed and thorough report.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As already referred to, the report of the Scoping Inquiry is being sent first to survivors. Information on supports available will be sent to survivors with the report and is also available on the Scoping Inquiry’s website. Details <br>
on supports for schools and their staff and students, will be made available to the schools’ management bodies <br>
to enable them to provide any necessary support to schools.<br>
